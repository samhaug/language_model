{"D--AfKOBJB0": "[Music] what up y'all that [ __ ] came to me how y'all feeling today man [ __ ] today we gonna do a little review about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "q3Td7Ng0y7s": "what you just saw was a chewed up smokey's edible cannabis fruit chew sour blue raspberry the sour blue raspberry is a good taste i like it it's kind of been like um made popular i guess in the cannabis edible candy realm oh i had something there i don't know maybe it's a glare anyway these are really good um edibles you get 10 of them 25 milligrams a piece so you get 250 bucks the package was uh 23. which is a steal for um edibles that are that high in thc considering almost every single edible isn't any higher than 100 milligrams you know and some of them you get six pieces for you know 60 milligrams but it is what it is these are totally worth it though 25 milligrams each candy i stay straight usually i wake up i take tinctures and stuff but i have school now so i'm trying to be a little more straight so i um i figure i'm gonna you know just smoke a little bit of sativa for work so i don't like going too insane and then uh i just want to have one of these and then go to class tonight i have my music school so i wanted to see uh you know how it made me feel like sit through there be pretty content take notes and still like not be too dumb yeah these things are perfect 125 milligram that's all it took it's got the delta 9 thc i just totally recommend these 23 bucks i don't know that's pretty cheap the dollar i don't know how you break it down a dollar a mil no i don't know a dollar per 10 milligrams of thc or something just about i think so things are good they totally work they're very effective and they know bs 10 milligram they're 25. so smokey's edibles you can find them at smokies.com if you can see that i'm out", "HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good", "UZUy5uWSpSA": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary smokey out uh it's quite smoky out here in southern california not just southern california but all of the west coast uh so i thought you know what better day to finally review these smokies edibles than this smokiest of days also the name of the minor league baseball team uh where i grew up in east tennessee smoky mountains uh so as i said these are the smokey's edibles very handsome packaging picked these up in long beach california for 18 bucks which puts them at a slight premium for the gummy edibles that they carry that are 100 milligrams these are a 10 serving 10 milligram edible and it's got all the good stuff on the back your lab testing results your nutrition information all that wonderful stuff and as i said these are 100 milligrams of thc 10 per piece and they contain less than 2 milligrams of cbd per piece really handsome packaging here from smokies i think it's quite nice looking uh i i really appreciate it it's not super opulent or ostentatious or anything it's just a nice print i'm easily impressed that way so let's go ahead and open up these gluten free dairy free vegan no high fructose corn syrup fruit snacks and give them a try [Music] we've got our standard child proof packaging here not gonna fool me today ah and here we are here are our smokies uh these are the jamberry fruit chews i'm not really 100 sure what a jam berry is but let's give it a try uh and i will mention that i did have a little bit of fat uh just a few minutes before this just to take these under optimal conditions probably not necessary i do it jic so here is our first 10 milligram smokies edibles jamberry gummy [Music] i would jam with that berry all day wow that is really tasty vaguely yeah uh berryish berry medley flavor some strawberries some blackberry but uh great gummy i mean taste wise there is just a smidge of that wheat aftertaste um but not much not much at all uh in terms of gummy's taste these are on the better end these are like the uh the plus gummies if not even slightly better tasting [Music] it's hard to say it's good yum again there is just that little bit of weed after taste it's not a whole lot um certainly not gonna ruin it for me uh outside of that taste is really good but the most important thing about these slightly more expensive than usual smokies edibles is are they gonna get you high and for that we're gonna have to wait about two hours to find out for sure like all wheat's reviews i'm going to finish these eight now seven whoops smokey's here over the next probably hour so and then like all wheat's reviews two hours after that last smokies i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly how these things are hitting because that's the most important part of any edible review until then stay high stay healthy stay out of this smoke and we'll see you guys soon later [Music] welcome back to wheats everybody it has been two and a half hours since my first smokies edibles not quite so smokies in here uh but still pretty smokies in here i don't know what that means what i'm trying to say is these are damn good gummies i am uh very high right now um i think i would put this in the uh higher tier gummy snacks in terms of both taste and potency um these feel every bit of 100 milligrams if not slightly more so than some of the uh better gummies like your steezies and plus i mean look at my eyes i'm pretty high uh it could also just be that i just finished and what the [ __ ] let's just cherry on top it while we're here uh it could be that i just finished an episode episode four of lovecraft country on hbo max or hbo go or hbo whatever uh hbo noun or verb next to it holy [ __ ] what a good show i'm pretty sure i actually carried on topped the novel upon which it's based years ago years ago uh but now the tv shows out it's really good it's not a whole lot like the novel but that's not a bad thing but also is not a bad thing are these smokiest edibles they are a bit of a premium at 18 uh as opposed to these sort of more 15-ish dollars but they are damn damn good um both in terms of taste and potency and also uh tasting and uh tasting great and being quite strong love craft country on hbo but things i like quite a bit uh both things i look forward to enjoying again at some point in the future smokey's edibles thumbs up love craft country your random cherry on top no effort added but that doesn't take away from the quality at all just like smokies full circle thank you so much for watching weeds guys it has been a blast hanging out with you until our next review live stream whatever it is that you watch with us stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then love craft country", "AQKqobvJV_0": "hey guys welcome in today's video we are doing a taste test on a different candy and in the last video go check it out

frunias so right away looking a look at it well here's the packaging it instantly reminds me of a now and later so it's just a little different version but this is a sour one we're gonna give it a try so as we pop it open take a look it's got a nice blue color to it this is perfect if you got like birthday parties or like even like gender reveals this will add a little fun to it and it's a nice light blue color perfect for that baby theme and it's got a little flecks in there you can take a look and see and if you like sour we're gonna go ahead and give this a shot oh it's very good it's actually very soft so you know how noun layers they start off hard and then get softer as you go this is soft very instantly and i actually personally like that the flavor is instant the sour is there but if you're afraid of it being overpowering don't worry it's just a little bit of a kick and it's very nice if you want to try one of these today you can come in store visit us or you can buy it online at allcitycandy.com", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "GgiO0eao4Nw": "we're getting lollipops today on walking the candy aisle hey guys Jeff here with a review of the tootsie fruitsie pops that's right blue raspberry yeah Blue Rose flavor exciting exciting guys I have reviewed the tipsy pop in the past but this is the tipsy fruit to pop a totally different thing that's right instead of your traditional tootsie lollipop with a tootsie roll center this is a tootsie lollipop with a fruit chew Center uh-huh uh-huh yeah I know blue razz is it blue raspberry throughout is the outside blue flavor and the inside razz flavor I don't know this comes in I think it comes in four or five different flavors maybe more I don't know since the Tootsie Pops themselves come in so many different flavors I don't necessarily know you need a ton of these but whatever I'm kind of more excited about this than the Tootsie Pop right like 50 pops are have tootsie rolls in the center and then you've got to eat a tootsie roll not the worst thing in the world obviously but come on are you really that interested in eating its if you roll I know I'm not okay there we go let see fruit to pop it's blue raspberry whoa whoa whoa whoa it says right there with a cherry Center ah so fancy I always think that this is a weird design the way they build the Tootsie Pops with this weird ridged middle mm-hmm blue R as a stick was a blue razz lollipop I reviewed a little while ago it was like uh was that a blow pop hmm could be could be hmm hi guys hey the blue R as flavor delish really really good really strong flavor just what you wanted of blue raspberry which blue raspberries were real don't you seems weird that it became a flavor that like everyone uses and yet blue raspberries do not really exist I know deep thoughts guys deep thoughts today I believe that the Tootsie Pop is the number one selling lollipop in America so this would be like the cousin of the number one best-selling lollipop and you know some might contend a better fit really think about it if you're in the market friend centered lollipop that is I think I would suggest while I love the idea and the philosophy around Chupa Chups I kind of think maybe the dum-dums are the best hard to say it's hard to say guys it really it could go any any way any any any day you catch me on it and also you know lots of different flavors out there what's what's gonna what's gonna strike your fancy you know Monday versus Tuesday I don't know it could be anything really all right so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna eat this lollipop I'm gonna kill my teeth trying to chomp through it I'm just gonna cut away and I will come back in a second when I have got you know gotten further along on this and we can get to the center okay be right back hey guys I'm back so I don't know I was gone like I was never even gone actually it really didn't take very long I'm not quite out there but I'm almost at the center now it was like three or four minutes of getting through this um not is there not is like thick as you would imagine um I just I'm at a point where I just don't want to I don't want to kill my teeth trying to Tromp through stuff that's real hard so don't expect a lot ton of jawbreaker reviews on this channel but I'm about to break the break into the middle so let's try and get in there and see how this fruit shoe tastes a cherry Center fruits uhmm the the outer candy lollipop candy when it does break away pretty good pretty good mm-hmm this sob fruit chew in the middle seems a little hard though like stick to my teeth hard there we go I don't bite into it and get it off anyone to get a bit of it out right little hard hmm what you really want like I'm not like nice and soft and chewy like up like a like a piece of bubblicious bubblegum you know not that I'm looking for gum specifically you know if I did a have a blow pop but I wish the middle was like nice and soft right wouldn't that be nice it's not it's hard it's like it's a fruit shoe but it's like a real it's like candy hardened reinforced fruit chew hmm like just those little bits I'm still chewing them that some you know requires work too much work for a candy I'm a working so hard just a candy flavors okay pretty solid cherry flavor little maybe a little artificial but you know whatever it's a fruit chew what do you expect don't remember I'm sure I reviewed the tootsie fruitsie like just to choose remember what I rated those but they would probably be better served not in the middle of like trapped in lollipop Wow guys little disappointing I got to say all that work and not so impressed I would be happy if this was just a stray blue raspberry lollipop because it's like frankly pretty good taste yeah this blue raspberry lollipop is great root tube something about the processing of keeping it inside like locked inside a lollipop it doesn't serve it well and I'm surprisingly unsatisfied oh well them's the breaks I guess that's just how it goes sometimes sorry Tootsie your fruit chew blue razz lollipop does not do it for me I like the blue razz cherry is fine I'm sure as a straight fruit chew but doesn't really work together not for me at least walk in the candy I was gonna read the took the fruit shoe pop blue razz I'm gonna raid it I'm gonna read it a 2 out of 5 and I think that that might translate to other tootsie fruit to pops as well it's just just how it goes anyway that's my thought on it you guys let me know what you think in the comments below am I crazy am i right am I on the right track or not I don't maybe I'm wrong you guys let me know in the comments below well thank you very much for watching please click the links if you'd like to see more reviews and I'll talk to you next time so long everyone have a good one", "8G0uy08bGNo": "[Music] welcome back so today well yesterday we went to see bd+ and got some new and goodies he decided to try out some new radicals there little gummies yeah squid yep and so there are 10 milligrams per serving and there's ting servings in each pack yeah and they are full spectrum hemp so it does have less than point 30 percent THC in each serving but for us today we're gonna take the little thing just because 10 milligrams of CBD with how much we have been smoking it and everything isn't gonna do much for us so for it to really work and has to give you the full effect how did you open pictures open [Music] and yes it for me I have the blue raspberry I have the Concord grape and what's interesting about them is like they're colored with natural products mine's colored with cabbage as far as like rubbish yes that's interesting okay so yeah it comes out as these little video gummies I don't know even how to do the individual servings personally you try it yeah you'd have to definitely cut it it does have like little marks to show you like where to cut but don't think that's easy to pull apart that's all good I just say you can definitely do the CBD in there but you can taste how much more natural it is is there seriously like a handful of ingredients there's coconut oil full spectrum hemp extra citric acid organic sugar and water I mean I teach a little bit I taste a little bit of the grape yeah yeah so way to go lunchbox alchemy yeah these are really good so we are at our local mall and we're just gonna kind of walk around I was wanting it to go into forever 21 to see if they have plus-sized stuff for me to try on and probably get some lunch since we have an 8 today it's up for this yeah but alright guys so we'll see you in a bit later so now we're like in the middle towards the end of our walk we've come to a few different stores yeah I still hopefully energetic yeah we walk it's more the only reason why we're stopping is because I decided to wear my combat boots today and they're happy on my feet so they're beautiful yeah you know it's all aesthetic and cute but I'm just not very cute oh yeah and right now we're about to go and Macy's and I'm gonna try to spray the fragrances to you know compare from my shop right yeah and we back in the cop sorry that the lighting is a little weird the sun's like in a weird spot right now but there you go yeah we're back in the car I got to finally smell my Viktor & Rolf bonbon so good I knew that had to be I've looked at what's all in it it's good just don't we're at the price I just can't spend there it's been sitting us to get a fragrance rate like that whenever I spray for you freely all day long he has to over all those gummies definitely helped highly recommend it tastes good - yeah they tasted really good the only thing that I think people are gonna have a problem with is the splitting just because it is a gummy so I think you've been cutting it will be a little difficult but the only way I can see possible is to cut into it Jonathas definitely from TV first for telling us about them yes and I will be linking in our description exactly where you can get it online on CD plus stop yeah I know let's say it's a we're delighting right now yeah thank you guys so much and we will see you next time and remember to spread the peace in that we do best my guys later [Music]", "GtsNJwCoQp4": "guys so i'm going to do a taste test today like i said for skittles gummies these just came out and i found these at walmart so i am definitely excited to try these i didn't even know honestly that they were coming out i'm gonna use scissors because i always have problems with packaging i've got the original and the wild berry so let's see hiro is getting jelly because he can't have any of this you don't know who hiro is he is my puppy he is a sheba emu if you want to follow his page it's hiro da chiba on instagram but first i am going to of course try the original so now this is the flavors right here grape lemon green apple strawberry and orange so i'm gonna try each one of them let's see let's get every flavor everybody gets a chance so i think this is all of them so there's five flavors grape let's give this one a try that does taste like the grape skittles but in gummy form wow good job skittles orange [Music] this orange one i don't know if it's because the grape coming in but the orange is pretty good um i don't know if i think it tastes like the skittles but it still tastes good and it's still orange taste now this is the green one and they've got that classic s um this is the green apple um okay that's pretty good too uh the texture is uh is very similar to a fruit snack like if you were to get like welch's fruit snacks it's got a chewiness it's not hard like haribo it's a little softer and slightly chewy it's an in-between type of gummy um this is the lemon um i don't know there's a weird taste to the lemon in a way like and i like the lemon i like lemon stuff but when i initially bit into it i thought oh okay but then something crept in i don't know if i like that if there's like a weird chemically way i don't know i might have to give it another shot but there's some type of aftertaste i don't know if it's like something that they put over it but not a fan of that one as much strawberry strawberry's pretty good i like it so far out of all the flavors i enjoyed the grape only because i'm also a great fan uh the green maple not bad and strawberry and orange lemon i thought i would like it but i don't know certain things when it comes to lemon products like when you're in candy sometimes it tastes like pledge and that's like the worst part so we've got the wild berry next and this one is berry punch melon berry strawberry okay i already tried strawberry wild cherry and raspberry i don't think the strawberry is all that different in this one from the original that'd be a little weird let's okay try to make it quick because heroes clearly like irritated that i'm not sharing um so i don't know if i like the wild berry mix as much even though like you would think a berry fan would be cool to what am i missing cherry okay so i'm gonna go with wild cherry first because sometimes i always think it's like a cough medicine type of taste and you know that's not the business at all um so this is the wild cherry the darker one i believe um yeah it has a little bit of a it's like okay but not my favorite but then again i already told you guys no my biggest thing if you've ever had those um are there like throw drops and they're cherry they're like signature i can't remember their name but you guys know what i i'm talking about it's like white and red packaging this is a strawberry again i probably should have had like a chaser or something to clear my palette yeah that's good um hmm i like melon stuff so i might save that for that last and berry punch let's try this one kind of like grape looking flavor that one's pretty good it does taste true to like the flavor that i would get in the strawberry or the wild berry pack for the skittles so they did pretty good job to resemble the flavors in a way to their actual skittles products so yeah and they have the same textures let's do the raspberry it's got that blue blast very taste you know that everybody knows it's like that kind of icy-ish taste to it when you get a blue raspberry flavor and this is the melon berry it sounds good it's been a while since i've had the wild berry um i like this one well the melon bear yeah i like the melon berry the best um berry punch is not too bad like come probably second the raspberry and the strawberry kind of tie and then the wild cherry oh no it's it for me personally it would go last but yeah these came out pretty good i mean they're pretty tasty i like them they remind me of like a fruit snack for kids um but yeah good job skittles yum uh so i definitely would recommend these i mean if you like gummies and you like that texture of like fruit snacks in those boxes uh that you would get at the store for your kids lunches or for yourself but yeah i give it a thumbs up you guys uh if you guys want to see more i've got other content coming for other stuff that i have got to try um the next things i want to try soon are probably these this weekend and i've been dying to show you guys i've been on the hunt for these so these will be coming up too because i have been dying to try this and been on the hunt so yes stay tuned for more", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming

tough right now to get to so what we're gonna do is just rip this open a little more there we go all right all right so she's the sticky one we've got a nice chewy gummy here it tastes to me like the sour patch kids the watermelon candies this is exactly what it tastes like like identical it's sweet you can taste a little bit of the cannabis on the inside of the gummy which i really like for me i use edibles to sleep i use them to go hiking as well and i like knowing that the cannabis is in there i feel like when you can taste it it affirmates the high a little bit [Music] i love it flavor is on point flavor is on point i'm thinking score out of ten aside from the packaging i hate i love how it views i just don't like it that it's in the bag i'd rather much rather be in a plastic container or some other kind of container but you know for me this product is almost a perfect product you know no gelatin made with pectin it does say distillate on it i think this is a 9.75 for me out of 10.", "C8kJtOmkh10": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the snack pack these are sour patch kids i have the red berry and the blue raspberry these were 2 48 at walmart and kevin spotted these i was like have we ever tried those before and they were in a weird place they were like hanging on the side of it not even an end cap they were like they're on the side of him yeah so yeah it was an odd place but it was it caught his eye so when we brought them home we put them in the refrigerator because we like this kind of dessert we like it so it wasn't refrigerated in the store it wasn't in the refrigerated section but we just like this kind of thing called just like pudding or jello or anything else so these are made with real sugar no high fructose corn syrup um it says they're called they're juicy gels so they're not jello they're snack packed juicy gels but if you know the snack pack brand you can normally find those in the with the pudding and they sell uh you know just chocolate and vanilla and all kinds of things but then they have these so it says there's six servings in the container so you get six cups and each cup is only 100 calories that's the same for me uh they're gluten-free these are made by conagra brands in chicago illinois i wonder if you can just slide this out without opening it yeah oh conagra oh huge big business big business [Applause] normally they just pop normally they do but sometimes you get that one that's stubborn i like the pictures on the top that's what they usually do yeah that's what they yeah they do yeah that's cute like mine are like i'm gonna have to oh i tore it can you get scissors no because i've already torn it now there we go this one's fine but yeah literally i tore that one i would of course you're right i'm getting the one in the middle i didn't think i would need scissors why do i get the special one [Music] yeah this is a broken one so we want to open this one okay red berry it smells good yeah if there's a box that needs some special help or something i get that one yeah or the package okay i smell it when it was cracked up literally yeah i wonder how this is gonna compare texture wise i tell you what it's a little softer than a jello but it's good it is softer um sometimes especially when the jello is pre-made in cups like these it has more of a rubbery rubbery um texture to it um that flavor is strong just like the sour patch kids it's a good one gummies it's good i like it it's very good um i actually absolutely love sauerkraut's kids it makes me wonder if she would like something like this they're good because she really does i mean she keeps a ball full of different bags you go in her place and there's a ball of different bags by her door and it just makes me wonder if she likes the texture of this i i truly don't know it's not jello in cups like this is not something that we bought because kevin and i always thought the jello brand had more of a like we said that rubbery bouncy almost yes texture so we bought pudding but not juicy gels so i would like for her to try these to see if she likes these uh this is blue raspberry it's 100 calories as well smell it for you it smells really good and the sourness level is not super sour i mean you get that that typically it's candy sour you know i like that in a gummy yeah because it's really small it's a little strong but if for it to have that uh very strong powerful flavor in that cup it's a lot it's a strong overkill i like it but yeah i agree it's too much but the red ones are really good yeah it's just you know something that's in that little the gummies it or on a worm you know you'll get those worms with multi colors like a orange and a blue it works because you're not getting an overload of it the blue raspberry it's it's so it's just an overload of that so for me personally i would not get that one again i think if you like the blue ones that's like your favorite you'll love those oh they did a good job they really did yeah it's really strong and it tastes just like what you get with the sour patch kids they think these are good yeah i do too i mean i think the textures are good i think the flavors are good it's got a little tartness to them but you know it's more candy-like than anything yeah oh yeah this is this is candy in a gel form that's exactly what this is that they did that they did a really good job now they need to come out with like drinks they haven't had drinks yet i don't i don't think so i don't think they've had drinks yeah now they need drinks in like a squeeze packet like a squish i don't know have they done a squeeze it version of that's been named with the sauerkraut i don't know that that's what they need to do so uh because we've gone from candy and now gel it just makes sense that they would buy liquid uh yeah they've had an ice cream uh so they need to do drinks next definitely but yeah both of these are good if you like the candy you're you're gonna like this so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] i", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "0BuAvXdQnfA": "what is blue-raspberry in the past couple of weeks I've reviewed a few blue raspberry juices and I started thinking to myself what the heck is blue raspberry anyway I always assumed it was a mix of blueberry and raspberry but then I got to thinking a little more and I realized that I can't I never taste blueberry at all in the blue raspberry vapes that I tried so I did some research and I found some pretty interesting things so it started in the 60s and the 70s when popsicles like otter pops and flavor ice became extremely popular it was really hard for consumers to tell the difference between all of the red flavors like watermelon cherry strawberry and raspberry so when any of those flavors were mixed into the same packages manufacturers had to figure out a way for customers to be able to tell the difference the answer to the problem was obvious they used different shades of red and pink and the color that food manufacturers chose for raspberry was a dark red dye known as amaranth or red number two and it's named after the dark red color of the amaranth plant but it doesn't actually have the plant in it so starting around the 50s people started to wonder about the safety of red number two but it wasn't until the 70s when research of the dye started really coming out a Soviet study in 71 found that red number two was linked to cancer and further studies by the FDA also found it linked to cancer so the dye was banned by the FDA in 1976 so with red number two out of the question food companies came up with a new way to market raspberry by making it blue the earliest use of a blue raspberry flavor that I can find is by the use of gold medal who announced a new blue raspberry flavor for their snow cone brand in 1958 which was supposedly inspired by the white bark raspberry whitebark raspberries are actually more like a dark purple or black and people say that the whitebark raspberry taste more like tart blackberries and not at all like what we think a blue raspberry today but that's what blew raspberry flavors are thought to be inspired by so somewhere around 1970 both the blue raspberry otter pop and the blue raspberry IC became huge hits which created a storm a blue raspberry product to hit the market more company started developing their own blue raspberry flavors and now we have a blue raspberry flavor that we all know and love but that isn't actually based on any real flavor but it does have a raspberry taste and what's funny about all of this is how we associate flavors with real fruit that don't actually taste like real fruit flavoring experts say that synthetic raspberry flavoring is actually a mix of cherry pineapple and banana it's not even raspberry so yeah there's a little history about blue raspberry which is actually one of my favorite vape flavors", "-5GZuZnVVGw": "ariana here this is my friend indira hi no we're not related today we're going to be reviewing smokey's gummies i've only ever tried like the non-medicated samples that they have in the dispensaries so i'm wait actually oh my god i can't believe i can't remember the fact that the first time i tried them was literally with you yeah like two years ago that's why i bought these it's all amazing but it's a different flavor and it's not melted together like mine was so we will get an accurate dosing this time yeah yeah are you just ready to do it like let's do it okay it was so like that was such the perfect like rip whoa okay you might have better luck with that how much do you want to take today two two i'm still a little bit high from earlier i'm gonna take three so then should i take and now i don't want to die take however much your heart tells you to take let's see okay these are really good i like these better than the blueberry ones yeah have you ever had these ones not many ones i've only ever had they were blackberry okay and melted so these are actually pretty freaking good i'm not gonna lie i'm my third one right now and i know that there's like no going back after this how many of you eat in two so that's your third this possibly will be my third it would only be fair if we both took three yes but [Music] i don't think you understand like my tolerance is not as high as yours if i die i'm blaming you if you die we'll have it on footage so i'm going to jail regardless that's true wish us luck hopefully indeed doesn't die i'm a little bit nervous but i think i'll be okay i think he'll be okay we'll we'll get through it yeah i believe in us yeah okay see you in a few one hour later you want to tell them what we're doing here sure um i'm getting a makeover and i am significantly higher than what i was before this um do you want to show them the look show them yes it's kind of like a glam look because i realize now that her skin tone is significantly lighter than mine no i think it's gonna look really good on you i still think so i'm gonna give you a lot of highlight before we get started i have one more surprise that i just have neglected to share with my dearest i'm scared yes but yes yeah okay what is it i'm gonna be blindfolded oh my god i haven't like seriously use this palette yet and there's just so many colors so many beautiful pigmented colors

cheeks okay i have some yeah okay oh my god i just feel like you're gonna look so beautiful we're gonna do the cut crease i need you to give me the brush that is green that is fluffy on the tip yeah yeah this one yes okay the cut crease and the girl's eye was like a brownish taupish color and if i remember correctly on the top right somewhere over here there's like a brown color that we're gonna put in her crease yes is this your eye yeah this is your eye okay that is your thumb this feels right the tricky thing is is trying to get the same color on that eye i think we're going to find out that's like yeah that's your crease am i stabbing your eye yes i'm so sorry and that's my eyebrow okay i'm so excited for this look can you point me towards the concealer oh is it the little one this one it has a silver top yes this is okay so we're going to put this on your lid to cut the crease that was the fireplace how are you feeling indira like how's the high i'm very very high so i guess these edibles work you guys for me yeah for sure they definitely are working for me i am having a great time honestly i feel like i could have taken more honestly maybe i could have done like 40 50. i was a little scared that i was gonna get just like so great yeah okay can you point me towards the shimmery color this one that one oh my god your face is so soft like i'm sorry i'm telling you man it's the vitamins i like feel the eye shadows crumbling down my face okay we need highlight i like this one i think it's safest probably just to put this in my hand and then put it yeah i think i'm done [Music] oh can i blend first yeah let's see if we can like really make something out of this [Music] the colors are really good the colors that we use you look like tinkerbell can we watch peter pan i dream of the bronzer one i forgot about that okay so i don't know if i said this but it's vegan and gluten-free which is pretty cool yeah that's a good option to have there's corn syrup there's a lot of things that i can't read and will not i could probably eat it i just like i'm too high and i don't want to yellow six blue one like i knew someone who's allergic to red dye number four yeah it's good though like don't get me wrong but yeah your girl got baited if you are red dye number four sensitive i'd probably stay away from these yeah i got some highlighter you said you wanted like teardrops like i was just thinking after when you blindfolded yourself i was like okay we're just doing some abstract [ __ ] for all you oh i am so sorry bro i think that concludes this video um thanks for watching i hope you guys had just as entertaining it was an emotional rollercoaster for me but definitely had some fun moments", "mwyUWbOHnoQ": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shop and we're on the icy squeeze candies cherry and blue raspberry and I promised in the hubba bubba squeeze pop video that i would compare them all together so let's start with these kind of just curious to see the consistency and then check the flavor now the other two we tried from hubba bubba were both sour and these are just regular cherry and blue raspberry - cool right there let me turn them around see if you can read anything there you have to turn it this way though for you to read something and not much more here but you could have paused enlarge the video if you want icy squeeze candy alright easy way to get in don't know if easy way to get in and see that peels right off I'm just curious to see is it as thick as the hollow Baba you know we'll find that out let me do this one first even though I started the other one now this is not one different kind of end than the hubba bubba here i'll let me just grab a hapa Baba real quick I got them both here and as you can see this one well if I can get it open is meant to be eaten off this tip this one kind of looks like you just squeeze it into your mouth let me give it a taste mm-hmm it is good too and it's thick watch like a syrup let me do the blue one whoo that one's good blue raspberry I think I like that one better so there's those two so let's see now tasty let's compare it to the hubba bubba sour blue raspberry put that one kind of right next to it in between very close in color if not exactly the same see that and then let me put a green apple in there all right so flavor-wise both really good thickness wise almost exactly the same consistency almost exactly the same so I guess you can't go wrong with either one let me just check the weight to the size this one here because 4 ounces and this one here is 2.1 ounces so it's double the amount in this container when we have a little more blueberry so basically you're just tilting your head back and squeezing it in but look at that house doesn't want to meet in the middle now even though I squeezed it in this little tray it's still gonna get eaten believe it or not I'm just kind of moving it around waiting for the center to connect come on come on squeeze candy there it goes nice very cool so is there another squeeze candy I have not tried I think it's time I see if there's more out there and then match them all up and you know see if there's the best ever squeeze candy so far I'm gonna say these are pretty equal good flavor coloring about the same there you go that's it it's the icy squeeze candy blue raspberry and cherry and thanks for watching it's really appreciate it but if you want to see me try these the description below we'll have a playlist or a link to those videos or just search our

want to share a brand new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much", "fMx7n7iFibQ": "I wasn't originally going to do this but I've been seeing so many people posting and so many people posting videos and I'm starting to realize that the bigger concern that we might have here over the next I don't know a few weeks is probably going to be inflammation related I'm seeing so many people stocking up on the wrong things so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run to Costco right now since they're still open and I'm gonna identify some foods that are a higher calorie that would be good to have just in your pantry we're not talking about just regular pantry staples I want to find calorically dense things we're talking things like macadamia nuts stuff like that where they're high-calorie and you could essentially feed an entire family if you really needed to so the things that I just think should be stocked up on but also things that are going to be inflammation modulating because if you're sedentary you're not getting vitamin D because you're indoors and you're eating a lot of preservatives you could be running into a pretty big longer-term issue with inflammation so let's head to Costco I'm at the house right now I'm gonna head over there I'll see you a minute I'm not gonna get toilet paper I don't even know if I could find some if I wanted to the goal here is to find high-calorie nutrient-dense foods let's see what we find this is a little bit different normally I have jr. with me to be able to film my every move but I'm just gonna snip what I can and film what I can so it's gonna be a little bit cutty for the Pens with his blog style it's not my normal style feel we're just an observation there's plenty of high-calorie nuts still here which doesn't look that anybody has touched more on that later I have a whole separate video on that okay so it's kind of interesting people have wiped out the bread section which kind of makes sense in theory however that is going to be one of the most calorically I guess vacant foods you're gonna find if you are not doing a low carb diet if you're doing some kind of a regular diet I would recommend going for some kind of gluten-free granola okay at least that's in the deal that gets you something in the way of nutrients but still gonna be extremely cool or clicked unseen if I can find something okay here's one that I found a green for you NOLA check this out flip the camera around here okay so the first thing that I want to point out with this whenever possible if you're trying to stock your home if you're trying to actually get true emergency food you're gonna want to get things that do not have any form of sugary whatsoever any blood sugar spike roller coaster ride he's going to throw things off but I will say this is a grain free granola check out the ingredients there we've got almonds organic honey pecans toasted coconut sunflower seeds coconut canola or sorry coconut oil vanilla extract salt cinnamon in the world of granolas that are grain free this is one of the cleanest ones that I've seen but one of the things that I'm looking at here the most 1/4 cup is going to be 160 calories so ordinarily this would be super high-calorie that I would not want to get it all but in the case of trying to get calorically dense foods this one out of all the granola is out of all the cereals out of all the breads probably one of the only grain things that I would recommend getting and it's technically not even grains so anyhow just food for thought there it is a little pricey though so I'm just encouraging you don't think bulk here don't just think how much volume of food can you get look at the caloric density if you're really thinking about emergency foods and prepping that's what's going to matter no there's a couple things that my mom taught me when I grew up backpacking right okay if it's gonna be emergency food or food that you hold on to it needs to do two things it either needs to be extremely calorically dense like macadamia nuts or something like that or it needs to be something you would never touch unless it was an absolute emergency don't get tasty things that are gonna make you want to eat more of it okay in the world of peanut butters the world of almond butters a world of all kinds of different nut butters doesn't surprise me that people are wiping out the peanut butter obviously it's the most cost effective and I understand that but let's take a look at what's in this stuff compared to some of the other options that you have what's gonna actually keep you satisfied check this out get Skippy alright sure calorically dense yeah but it's also got a bunch of sugar in it you know that's a good amount considering how many tablespoons there are but then look at this ingredient here hydrogenated vegetable oil that literally means that they've taken oil added a hydrogen molecule to it to make itself stable so is it shell stable absolutely but is it something that's going to trigger inflammation within your body and cause issues down the line okay when everything blows over when we get through all this and what's gonna happen we're gonna end up with people that are very unhealthy and have long term conditions because they're developing bad habits I don't think that a few weeks of eating like this is gonna kill you they're gonna develop bad habits so then the question comes almond butter or nuts in this case I would go with in Matsoukas look at the ingredients here cashews almonds so let's flax seeds chia seeds hazelnuts pumpkin seeds and Celtic sea salt there's a reason behind these ingredients and why they'd be on my list in this case okay it may be more expensive but the flax and the Chia is actually going to satiate you plus you're getting at least somewhat of a source of omega-3s now we're talking about something called alpha lineage assuming alpha linolenic acid which isn't like a true omega-3 like you would get from say fish for example but it's at least going to get you a little bit of the omega-3s it can get converted in a hot tip if you have a little bit of turmeric along with those omega-3s for getting from flax and Chia you can end up absorbing more of those Omega threes we're all trying trying to fight inflammation here so that's the goal the flax the Chia are a soluble fiber that at least help you flush out some of the toxins and preserves that you're getting from some of the other food plus extremely calorically dense definitely makes the cut get the nut so over the almond butter definitely over the peanut butter okay I just found something that I'm super stoked to see that people are picking up now sardines over here definitely running on lower supply here so that means people are buying them not as many people seem to be buying this salmon but let me show you about the salmon because the canned salmon is actually really good stuff one of the only times you'd be able to get wild caught salmon at this price check out wild Alaska pink salmon 520 milligrams omega-3s per serving the big common denominator took a lot of the foods that were consuming when we're looking at anything shelf-stable is that it's going to be high omega-6 profile why because the shelf-stable fats are usually gonna be cruddy omega sixes that's why you don't see fish just sitting on the shelf just not me refrigerated right but when you get it in a can that also is BPA friendly you can get those on mega threes look at you can come out of this whole situation being healthier there's also a couple hundred calories in each one of those cans I mean that's enough - that's realistically if we got into a really bad situation that's gonna feed you for a day one of those cans is gonna feed you to your family members and you're gonna be fine okay now take a look at this sardines this is sardines in olive oil normally I would recommend sardines just straight up eating waters that you're getting the main benefit coming from the oil in the fish not the oil that's added but at least these guys add olive oil avoid at all costs costs excuse me if it comes in cottonseed oil or soybean oil you just don't want to have it they're definitely a good catch and one of the most calorically dense things that you could eat now let's see if we can find some more stuff okay soup's chili beans things like that everyone's going for the beans really quick my concern is if everyone switches gears really quick and all of a sudden starts having a bunch of beans a bunch of chili when their bodies aren't really accustomed to it first of all you're not gonna absorb those nutrients second of all that's a lot of havoc on your body so let's look at the soups that we got here there's one in particular that I would recommend during this time in the Amy's soups surprisingly a pretty darn clean check this out okay they got the lentil soup pretty calorically dense 300 calories in a can let's take a look here we've got filtered water green lentils celery carrots organic onions potatoes extra virgin olive oil soot the fact that they're using olive oil is pretty phenomenal here again in this one a little bit more complex onions lentils carrots celery extra virgin olive oil once again garlic balsamic this is totally good to go and yes it's a vegetarian is it keto no it's not but who cares okay if you're in a situation where you're just trying to get good calories in the sodium is actually pretty low two four and fifty per can because these are the lighter sodium ones so this wouldn't be a bad emergency food people stock up on the most interesting things like chicken stock there's like no caloric density there it's nothing it's just broth might as well get something that has a little bit of life to it plus the lentils although they can be hard to digest are going to be rich in zinc and rich in some of the minerals that you may become deficient in that can't ultimately help combat some inflammation okay don't bother with the soybean oil obviously I doubt people are going to be loading up on that don't bother with the shortening if I were to load up one one I would say probably coconut oil would be the best it looks like people are loading up on right now it is very important that you take care of your gut microbiome here's what's going on we have a hundred trillion little bacterias in our debt they dictate a lot more than what we think if all of a sudden we are not outdoors as much okay we've held ourselves up we might end up seeing a shift in that but more importantly if we shift our food a whole lot we're no longer eating a bunch of greens we're not getting the buter day the butyric acid that we normally would get in the gut things are gonna change the guts gonna change so if the guts gonna change we're gonna change our serotonin is gonna change our moods gonna change so at least if you go with coconut oil over any other oil you at least get the Mauna Lauren and the Lord acid conversion which means that inside your gut it's feeding some of the gut bacteria has a probiotic effect so out of all the oils to be the most shelf stable and most long-term in terms of overall health benefit inside your gut I would probably opt for coconut oil I'm a big fan of avocado oil olive oil of course but in this particular case I think coconut oil might be the safest thing in terms of a high calorie food to stock up on in terms of the frozen section I don't want to touch a whole lot on that stuff right now just because so much of the frozen stuff is just loaded with preservatives but I think there's a few things I shouldn't touch on I'll just grab one or two random things that I think are gonna be helpful out of the frozen section outside of veggies always go for your fruits and veggies frozen they're gonna save some money but also quite frankly they are usually higher-quality there is a study out of UC Davis that found that like frozen broccoli frozen peas all those things had more nutrient value than fresh or at least to the same simply because they're frozen immediately so you end up preserving stuff so load up on the frozen veggies at least that way you can maintain your gut biome of it one of the things I've been stocking up on at home actually is yogurt now Costco's yogurt is all pretty low calorie I would opt to go for the higher dairy fat yogurt let me show you something okay so the Greek yogurt obviously not a whole lot of calories in it but what we're after here isn't so much the calories it's more so the probiotic content but you want to go with the higher fat dairy believe it or not the dairy fat is actually quite healthy there are studies that show that higher consumption of dairy fat ends up leading to less risk of cardiovascular disease and it has more to do with a fat being a specific kind of fat that can be used by the body including conjugated linoleic acid which is really good for fat loss to more of the actual negative effects in terms of cardiovascular disease come from the oxidation that occurs because of all the sugar consumption now the bigger issue that I have with dairy is more sort of kinds of protein that are in it you usually want to go for goat milk or goat yogurt whenever possible I stock up on goat yogurt but it's not exactly the easiest thing to get simply because it's going to be a different kind of protein called beta casein 8a - which is much better sorry I'm fretting out of it here not crashing the people so that's usually what I want up for while very yogurts good regular Greek yogurt is close second and then after that you can start getting like almond yogurt coconut yogurt stuff like that like cauliflower stir-fry but there's just no coal or density to it it's not exactly something you want to waste freezer space stocking up on right now plus it's really there's not much nutrient value in cauliflower and you get D and old methane you get some of the indole-3 carbinol conversion really just not the best you could stock up on fruit but I would argue that you should stock up on frozen veggies more than that let's see what else we can find as for cheeses if the cheese's are in the regular refrigerated section I would try to avoid them spend a little bit more money get the cheese in the quality age section we'll go over there in a minute and talk about it let's see what they've got here actually these Bell brands these big adult ones these are actually okay the issue with them is there's not a good bang for the buck again caloric density but because they're wrapped in wax they last a little bit longer I came across the big one people ask me about the Kirkland Signature protein bars all the time so let's cover these for one second because I've got quite a bit of things to say but at the end of the day they're not all that bad let me just rip them apart a little bit because it's what I do these guys have done a pretty good job of making a healthier knockoff of a quest bar let's take a look at the ingredients record okay first thing I want to focus on milk protein isolate not the best way that I would start a protein bar okay milk protein isolate means they just have straight-up milk solids okay whether it's the protein but also everything else then we've got whey protein isolate which is great fiber from tapioca starch it's going to blow you like crazy cashews I wish they would have used something a little bit lower carb and a little less inflammatory unsweetened chocolate then they use erythritol which I understand cocoa powder natural flavors cocoa butter sea salt sunflower less fun and stevia actually pretty darn clean the only thing I don't like is the milk protein isolate in there I just wish they would have changed that into something different or start with just playing up the way but in terms of feeding the masses and stuff like that it's actually a pretty good product now let's see this one's a little bit different these are just different flavor combinations looks like it's the same thing a protein blend milk protein isolate tapioca starch peanut butter erythritol peanut flour pretty low inflammatory if you ask me now erythritol is going to bloat some people I would give this probably a good 7 out of 10 if I really trip I mean it's really not bad but the caloric density it's not bad either so I would like to see people stocking up on these in terms of emergency food that actually tastes good the problem is they taste good remember what I said anything that tastes good should not really be an emergency too however if you learn to be healthy see the taste good is good okay I want to check out the pure protein bars look at these what time and that's worth mentioning at this point milk protein isolates seem kind of thing whey protein concentrate okay I usually run away when I see white protein concentrate just because that's really low quality whey hydrolyzed collagen that's cool glycerin they're using that as a binder it's pretty compliment at all okay we don't want that molten salt molten salt syrup fractionated oh gosh okay this is garbage pure protein is garbage definitely want to go for the Kirkland brand in that case it's been a lot of time in the bars there's just more healthy things to give you did time bars yes pretty solid but still punch a serving up these are all this knockoffs of kind Nature Valley stuff is one of those way okay we just got into the nut Isle now I did a full video literally up to sip Costco talking about the best nuts to get if I was in a true true serious emergency situation I would want to be stocking up on nuts and seeds I want the minerals I'd walk busy I want things that I would really need to keep me going for a long time and if any of you anything is there are so many nuts and so many seeds that are just on the Shelf if they're not wiped at law everyone's about the toilet paper everyone's bought the bread everyone's brought the rice and the beans like they're gonna go into hiding for a decade I mean realistically we need things that are keep us going for a few months or worst case scenario like a year if supply chain is damaged right so let's check out some of these best ones that we should choose and some best practices when we're getting out nuts I'm gonna make this super abbreviated but macadamia nuts definitely take the cake okay they're not the highest omega-3 profile but they're the high or the lowest omega-6 which means you can't eat a lot of them if you had to live off of them for example and not go into a serious omega-3 imbalance probably the only nut that you could do that with plus they have a really unique fat in them called palmitoleic acid which is an Omega 7 which makes omega-3 is more readily available in the body so highly recommend that pistachios also not a terrible choice they're a little bit higher carbohydrate so yes you can develop a little bit more of an issue there but one of the things I'm concerned most about is these have if you can see this yeast extract which is msg so they basically have added MSG to those so you eat more of them I don't like that the Kirkland pistachios are just not a good bang for the buck like you're gonna spend you see nine point two six per pound see what the ingredients are here I mean good ingredients just pistachios and sea salt yeah I mean they wouldn't be terrible I would just opt for something that's a little bit more nutrient-dense pumpkin seeds for example extremely high in zinc so one of the best things you could eat in 8.6 four pounds so a little bit better they're organic sprouted pumpkin seeds which means they're sprouted which means they're gonna absorb better within your body sprouted means they've soak them in water for at least 24 hours to where it breaks down what's called the phytic acid it breaks down what are called the anti nutrients so you can actually utilize the nutrients let me explain something here there's a reason why when you look at animal droppings you see pieces of nuts and seeds in it because the nothing seams don't break down they have anti nutrients that are designed to not digest so that they get passed through the feces and can continue to sprout and continue to grow it's just a natural process so funny the way people look at me when I'm holding up a phone talking to myself but I'm used to having a cameraman with me so that's what you want to get them sprouted sprouts gonna allow that process to not occur as much you can actually assimilate them and absorb them a little bit more so the next best one let me show you real quick you want to buy them in the baking section because that way you're not paying for all the extra roasting and you're not paying for all the extra marketing and everything that goes along with it pecans high omega-3 walnuts high omega-3 I would say pecans are a little bit easier to digest so I usually opt for them there's something here that does make me feel kind of warm and fuzzy inside gives me just the nice cozy feeling and that's this check this out the junk food aisle the cracker aisle actually quite vacant people know not to just buy a bunch of sugary snacks which is really refreshing to see what's interesting is that they're flocking to things that are seemingly healthy which is exactly why I'm doing this video I want to kind of debunk some of the common stuff out there where people are just making the wrong choices and I thing is when we look at the actual legit just cracker and cooking in sweet aisle well people aren't reading the stuff here just a really refreshing thing to see I think we're actually starting to make an impact this is really cool one of the things that people tend to overlook because it's just generally seen as unhealthy it's going to be precooked sausages there's some good options now okay there's some good ways to preserve things without adding well preserve this so high calorie foods are gonna feed your family for a while where you don't have to stock up on garbage let me show you this one Sabich penis I've actually never personally try the flavor this but the ingredients are pretty solid check this out okay organic chicken organic basil and then two personal s the following roasted garlic onion powder garlic powder sea salt organic vinegar organic black pepper oregano and calcium agitating the casing which is perfectly fine that's just a derivative of calcium essentially so really really clean the only thing that's a bummer is the sodium content is very very high if you're doing a low-carb diet that works out because yeah you can keep your mineralization but what I like is 160 calories for a link okay if I had this in a handful of macadamia nuts I could maintain an Aikido genic state for a number of weeks before I would have a nutritional deficiency of any sort so this brand is really good at clean then you compare it and even what's doesn't I'm just gonna guess okay pork the hydrated pineapple and his sugar of course yeast extract there we go msg that'll be careful there citrus extract that's not a big deal paprika yeah straight up in mustard okay we don't want to be having that's one of the worst things you could have right now during this time normally I would say to try to get like a wide diversity of nutrients in terms of protein but I try to get your chicken in try to get your beef try to get report and that still stands but I will say you're probably gonna get more quart density from beef right now and you would from chicken if you have chicken and you're getting high-calorie chicken that means you're getting chicken that's high fat and chicken fat is much lower quality than say fat from beef so I just want you to keep that in mind if you're not normally a beef person it might be the best way for you to just kind of satiate yourself however I don't need a ton ton of beef this is a good time for me to stock up on beef because I will only eat it if I really really need to otherwise that will offer some other things right let's see what else they've got over here if they're organic Oh perfect look at these are a great option if you had to choose between wisps moon cheese and these parmesan crisps good these are 14 little bags so you pay more money for packaging moon cheese although it's clean it's just cheddar cheese in which leaves a lot to be desired okay now it's not terrible but then when you look at parmesan crisps we've got Parmesan cheese ooh Wow okay I just got debunked I was expecting this to be good okay here's the thing I would opt for parmesan because parmesan is a much cleaner cheese lower lactose easier to metabolize aged better enzymatic function parmesan in general is really good in the body but these guys I'm disappointed made in Sonoma that's literally where I grew up - I'm from Sonoma this kind of makes me disappointed Sonoma Creamery hopefully you someone from your company sees this and you can make some changes why do you have to put brown do I have to put a grain in there not only one grain but you put organic oat bran organic quinoa oh yeah what just frustrates me keto people just really upset with that in this case I'll probably go for the moon cheese cuz check this out twenty-three point five servings per container seventy calories per serving six to seven little nuggets of these guys seventy calories nothing you want to load up on cheese for your calories but again why aren't people grabbing that it's not even a bad price nine bucks and that's 23 and a half servings you have to look further than just how much you're getting in terms of volume okay if it was a giant bag for $8.99 I'm sure people would just be buying it all like crazy they're not reading how many servings are actually in it try to stay away from the dried fruit okay just going to be a big instant spike and something to note about dried fruit obviously it's concentrated fructose and let's learn about fructose fructose does not get stored as a muscle glycogen in most carbs you eat can store in your muscles like you go for a run you work out you need some carbohydrates skim store in your muscles and that's fine it's not gonna go to fat fructose rides a different bus in terms of metabolism okay it gets into the liver but we can only hold like 35 40 grams of fructose in our liver and then it spills over in turns to fat but what happens when you have a concentrated amount of it in some kind of like a you know if dried fruit right well you're gonna have a to those snacks and it's gonna start going into de novo lipid Genesis and go through spillover so anyhow just something to think about okay so cured meats bacon salami things like that there's a few things you need to know pork fat isn't the best fat in the world but if it is the saturated pork fat it's a little bit better than say the polyunsaturated fats are normally important pork has a high degree of those polyunsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats although good they are very very fragile so I'm going to show you something after they close attention to the visual here I'm a piece of salami this pork see how it's all marbled in there okay it's tough to tell but you know usually when you're getting a cut that's heavily marbled that way it's usually also high in the polyunsaturated fats now we can see for sure here yep look at that okay here's a good way to tell seven grams of total fat two and a half of which are saturated that leaves us with four and a half grams of fat that are probably a low quality polyunsaturated in this case now this is a total guess here so let me see but if I go with like a Parma ham or prosciutto haha there we go right three and a half grams one and a half grams which is saturated fat so I'm left with well it's a little bit better not a whole lot better but still what that means is that we cover more of the sachin fat and less of the polyunsaturated fats and just quick math that you want to do you'll always want to have a higher ratio saturated fat compared to the remainder that's going to help you out in determining the healthiest quality meat they're similar thing applies for smoked salmon we think just based on theory that like smoked Salmons gonna last for a long time but it doesn't it actually goes bad pretty quick like if I'm looking at them right now it's mid-march this is expiring at the end of March it's not that great but let me show you a little something what you need to pay attention to either way with smoked salmon if you are gonna freeze it or anything like that try to avoid the Norwegian stuff yeah that's been shown to be pretty contaminated what I want is wild Alaskan sockeye today the reason I want wild Alaskan sockeye higher in what it's called astaxanthin what makes it pink is actually an antioxidant so think about this salmon are swimming upstream crazy-fast creating a lot of oxidative damage within their bodies okay exercise creates damage and we usually have to fight it well they have to create their own built-in antioxidant to help it defeat that which means that antioxidant Chris Erbs the polyunsaturated fats that are in Sakai whereas something like this see how it's all pale compared to this you always want to go for the Sakai yeah and come on get real when it's smoked it's so salty anyway you don't taste the difference okay this one's a little fattier but what good is fat if it's not gonna get you anywhere right okay the fat cut on my middle look it's a higher fat content in that than it isn't that definitely go for the wild sockeye expiration on this let's see April 16th so it lasts longer too so I can have that in the fridge for a good month or I could just put it in the freezer and have it for a while just something to note there quick touch on the cheese section okay you learn that cheese is obviously they're gonna last for a while but you also want to get cheeses that are gonna be in lower beta casein 8 a 1 ok which is complicated sounding but we want better quality proteins in our cheese okay we want good quality stuff aged so we want to go for goat cheese you want to go for blue we want to go for feta let me just show you what we got here Costco is a pretty good deal on feta crumbles okay and these are gonna be good throw June 19th there's a high sodium content in here but also these are pretty caloric okay one ounce is gonna give you 70 calories okay so this is great now this isn't sheep's feta but still pretty solid stuff I would definitely go for feta as an option crumble gorgonzola would be a good one too blue cheese depends how long it's been aged I wouldn't really recommend stocking up on it right now but I would go for like some aged cheddar okay this stuff let's see reading up here missed the organic yeah and when we got a one-ounce cube is gonna be 120 calories yep there we go cows that are free to roam and grass fed that is super super important we definitely wanna be paying attention to that now I will say once again anything you can find with a wax coating he's gonna preserve and last longer so wow I don't know let's see Mimolette thing I think I'm saying that right in salt like it starters okay this one's pretty age too so that's not a bad one okay pass on those okay now we're getting into some of the other stuff okay so these are like more than ooh here we go spreadable goat cheese sorry this is just cool calories here one ounce 70 calories this is gonna be one of the higher quality cheeses that you could get here might be the only goat cheese that I see oh no yep this goat cheese right here wow that's a bargain 6:59 for two things of goat cheese fresh goat cheese that's how you know this is real okay calories 80 calories for one slice which is about one ounce pastor s coats milk salt bacterial culture and microbial enzymes definitely would get this now also it's good until July 5th because it's in this package right you could also freeze it and nice thing is goat cheese doesn't denature as much when you thought out other cheese gets really weird if you freeze it and then thought out goat cheese just for whatever enzymatic reason seems to hold itself together unfortunately fish is just it's a bad time people are still wiping it out because I think they're gonna freeze it but I don't know if I'd recommend just getting a whole lot of fish right now it's probably just not the best time corned beef this is interesting looks nobody's gonna be celebrating st. Patrick's Day right now let's see what else we got in the way of commuting stuff remember stock up on the beef go easy on the chicken if you are gonna get the chicken and get the chicken breasts okay that way you're not loading up on the chicken thigh which I know is higher calorie but this is all about getting the right calories if you're gonna eat calorically dense foods don't just eat any co-worker than scoots get the calorically dense foods that are actually gonna give you some value that's what's important right anyone can grab a Snickers and need something caloric intense I'm trying to teach you the right calories yet Costco has some good options when it comes to beef but this will probably my favorites the Bison it's $7.99 a pound technically which is pretty steep but the nice thing about bison is it's generally grass-fed grass-finished which plays a big important role so again with beef I would usually recommend going leaner and the nice thing is is that grass-fed grass-finished naturally is that mean you know believe it or not but it's also a higher omega-3 content so again trying to control inflammation trying to not have an issue with inflammation as you're changing up your diet rapidly so try to go for the bison that's probably the best beef source at Costco right now let's see 11 grams of fat 4 of which is saturated which means you're left with you know roughly seven grams of mystery fat could be monounsaturated fat could be polyunsaturated fat but really caloric density you're gonna get most bang for the buck there I don't recommend getting big fatty steaks unless you absolutely know where they're coming from because the fat is where the toxins and everything is stored in the grains the soy everything they concern for those of you that are interested I did put a link down below for butcher box that way you can get grass-fed grass-finished meat and delivered to your doorstep they are still shipping during this time I've just ordered like 25 cuts myself so you can use the link down below there's a special discount and especially right now because things are just a little bit insane so you can use that link and you can get grass-fed grass-finished milk delivered to your doorstep whether it's beef chicken fish scallops pork you name it so go ahead and use that link I do have a good partnership with them they are supported this channel they are a sponsor this channel put a disclaimer but I am saying right now and during this kind of hectic times it is a good way to stock up on some of the frozen meat and might be better than braving Costco and getting some of the lower quality meat that you're generally going to find at any grocery store so I highly recommend you check them out down below in the description after you finish watching this video save a couple bucks that way too let's jump to pork for a second once again the thing with pork loin is you can usually or pork chops too you can usually trim off the fat so look at see how the fat isn't a nice thick layer that's what we want that way we can trim it off and we're not getting a lot of marbling we can get a leaner cut of meat the protein within pork is actually really good it's just the fatty acids that we're not a big fan of ribs again try to avoid not the best kind that you'd want to be bringing in lamb not exactly the most cost effective thing to be bringing into your house right now I will say though lamb mutton although I'm not the biggest fan of it ethically he is one of the best fatty acid profiles that you can find okay let's go take a quick look after you ready to drinks and the protein powders really great because I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing to stock up on right now again if you're trying to maintain a music healthy lifestyle you're working out at home doing what you can that's gonna be the last thing that I check out before this looks familiar like you did a whole video on this that's been check out the whole entire protein video that we did at one point there the ready to drink liquid proteins at Costco are not really good to go let me point out the ones that we're gonna grab one that I would recommend okay the grass-fed clean protein shake and the flip it around sugar they call it a grass-fed protein shake I'm just gonna touch on this really quick grass-fed milk protein concentrate okay again just in case you haven't watched my videos before we want isolate not concentrate concentrate means that they've just concentrated the protein and they haven't isolated any of the good quality whey then we use agave which is pure fructose remember I told you about fructose fructose is sketchy because it goes straight to the liver and it can only hold the body can only hold so much high oleic sunflower oil not the end of the world anyhow the point is relatively low quality but believe it or not I would opt for the plant-based one if you were looking for an RVT you know not a bad thing to stock up on just in case I just don't know if the price is really conducive okay we've got filtered water pea protein alkalis cocoa high oleic sunflower which I have other videos on it's really not that bad rice brand not the best trisodium phosphate is okay try potassium citrate so k gellan gum monk fruit that's a plus vegetable blend actually pre non clean so all the RT DS and I've talked about this in other videos this organ RTD is not bad still not the best though and definitely not the most cost-effective I'm gonna save you guys a bunch of time the Kirkland brands the premier brands are both the garbage and it comes down to the RTD let's look at some powders really quick okay your game keto a lot of people talk to me about this one it's clean it's just you're getting collagen proteins you're not getting like actual protein protein which I'm not opposed to collagen but in the case of really trying to I don't know maintain muscle mass during this time not really the go-to okay a quick whey protein 101 you always walk away protein isolate not whey protein concentrate so we have two very similar ones here I'll show you we have whey protein isolate and we have whey protein isolate as the primary source which means check this out protein blend whey protein isolate wafer didn't concentrate oh and whey peptides natural artificial flavor less than acesulfame potassium which is highly insulin and genic it does spike insulin causes a cephalic insulin response and we sucralose which is going to destroy your gut biome you need to be avoiding sucralose right now it is not the time but then we have whey protein isolate same exact brand which is whey protein isolate cocoa trust process of alkali natural flavors which is questionable still but lecithin salt stevia leaf extract and xanthan gum infinitely cleaner significantly cleaner go for this one and right now as of March 21 bucks or 22 bucks that's a really good deal this combat it tastes amazing but a total garbage take a look at it micro filtered protein blend whey protein concentrate isolate definitely not good but I think someone broke into this cigarette containing okay that was loud sorry about that so anyhow then when we get look at the plant-based ones gonna make this quick here let me show you your again probiotic one is not bad organic protein we've got a few proteins brown rice protein chia seed and it's got a creamer base which is made from organic high oleic sunflower oil that's been dried all that high oleic is is it basically means that they've taken the oleic acid which is quite a good component out of some of the polyunsaturated fats to make it a more stable shelf stable fat cuz all they've done but it's much better than hydrogenated I'll explain a little bit more about what it is okay so oleic acid is found in things like olive oil avocado oil stuff like that you're gonna see it a lot okay it's very very good for you what they'll do is they'll take those components and they'll industrialize them to basically make a certain oil even soybean oil higher oleic so what they've done is they've taken a polyunsaturated fat that would normally be very unstable and it made it a monounsaturated fat this is a good thing but it doesn't really make it a better fat soybean oil is still soybean oil and even the studies that take a look at people that consume high oleic soybean oil versus regular soybean oil they still offer all the negative health effects all the issues the only thing that changes is a slight change in the instance of obesity rates and it probably just has to do with the fact that maybe they're not consuming anyhow just something to note so really the way protein is gonna come down to the top through nutrition whey protein isolate and probably the basic or gain probiotic blend and possibly the or gain plant-based ready-to-drink will be the only high-calorie ones that I would really recommend take your protein powder and add some coconut cream to it in fact that's one more thing that I want to show you to stock up on here in the canned food section I almost forgot it would have been a bad one if I forgot some of the stuff in the canned food section and the thing is is for those of you that are watching this entire video you get the sweet treat because this is a big one okay okay mayonnaise at Costco is all soybean oil again trying to fight inflammation right soybean oil boom not what we want sometimes you'll see a primal kitchen here but doesn't want you to have it it's a lot of their canned goods are just gone well well let's find something else instead if you do want to give yourself a high-calorie treat at least these four 500 fives are really good really good clean pork rinds they're just easy eat a ton of them pork rinds salt coconut palm sugar which is a little bit of a bummer because you never really want to be combining carbs and fats but I had to show you something since they were out of what I wanted to show you which was coconut cream you see if you get those big cans of coconut cream or not in a big can but a can of coconut cream in the baking section like for Thai food or coconut milk in a can super high caloric excuse me high calorie very caloric but also high in the medium chain triglycerides same stuff we're getting from coconut oil you can mix a little bit of that with your almond milk and it's gonna make your almond milk tastes almost like milk it's delicious but you're also getting in that probiotic effect that lauric acid the mono Lauren conversion within the gut it's gonna help support that gram-positive bacteria again all about gut health that's gonna happen how you maintain your levels of you know well good immune balance that you're not immunocompromised and set your inflammation levels aren't flying through the roof yeah I'm gonna head out again and lines a little bit too long you can brave right now but at least wanting to share some good content", "xoAUHpEA-fM": "welcome to our social track we back with another exclusive and we'll be trapping hard all day for these celsius you know what it is man another exclusive make sure you like sub and

your boy benji i'm out peace", "lA_cPvaD1b0": "today kevin and i have a very very fun review to do for you and we are going to be reviewing big league chew bubble gum we have eight different flavors here these are the only eight flavors that we saw on their website that they even make so we were very very fortunate to find all eight flavors at five below they were a dollar fifty each at five below and i'm going to be honest i have not had big league chewbo bubblegum since i was probably uh 11 or 12 years old oh yeah i was just praying a long time and i have only had the original and the great yeah i don't think they had a lot of the other flavors i've never had the other ones so i didn't even know that they had a lot of these flavors it was like we kept seeing them at five below what it was like oh my gosh the what caught our attention though is the hot chocolate they were on a special like seasonal display and they had the one with the snowman and they had a sample they had a santa claus one too uh but we got the original we got hot chocolate cotton candy grape uh strawberry um blue blue raspberry blue raspberry sorry watermelon and sour apple okay so we're gonna try the original verse uh they're all the same calories eight pieces are ten calories these are uh it says go to www.biglychew.com let's see if you really wanted to to know the portion you'd have to weigh it oh yeah because this is like shredded gum it says they're made in akron new york it says aspartame free gluten free and peanut free celebrating 40 years of bubble gum fun for everyone well i'm 40 uh 48 years old so that means uh it came out while i was a kid that i mean that's pretty cool i didn't know that it was introduced during my childhood that's neat um so you open it up like this and if you're wondering why do they make it like that it's because i've always heard it was supposed to imitate the amino dip yeah tobacco and tobacco yeah because these these there's a lot of baseball players on these and baseball players are known to dip and um and so this is how it looks and so you would grab a big uh you would grab a hug yeah that's a lot you would exactly think and you fit your mouth i love the flavor just regular bubble gum and then they're kind of aluminum like seeing this roll up and it'll stay together just like chewing tobacco and even if you put it in your purse your backpack whatever it'll stay together now i got three little strands and that's enough gum for me not to blow bubbles this is the amount that i would have gotten as a kid honestly this is the same amount i would get now that's good that's your good just your typical classic gun because that's a big water gun bait i think you'll get up for it i think i'm allowed to have as much you can have as much as you want that's a lot of gum but it tastes like original it's very good if you're wondering how does it taste now this i'm honestly scared about this uh smells i've talked to i've talked to you before during the reviews about the chocolate chapstick this smells like that chocolate chapstick i'm trying to get some out for you on this plate um okay you're just thinking of this [Applause] it's actually not bad yep it does taste like uh you can tell it's chocolate it's the most artificial chocolate you'll ever take yes it's like a tootsie roll this this chocolate chapstick choc choco always reminds me of a tootsie roll a classic tootsie roll flavor which is fake chocolate too mm-hmm it's a good name that's what that tastes like i don't think there's anything wrong with it um i doubt it'll end up being my favorite flavor no but i do like it and i was told my friend carlos was under the impression that this was a five below exclusive flight i don't know if that's true or not but that's that's what it was on their website uh yeah that doesn't mean you can buy it through the website i'm just saying right i don't know what made him think that but that's what he was thinking uh this is the cotton candy i think what i'm impressed with and like james that we haven't had these since we were kids no um the texture is very soft yeah and um for lack of a better work kind of a silky gum flavor it's very soft it's very uh it's not tough or you know because sometimes you get gum that's really tough this is not tough at all i wish that they still had all the gums around so we could review them that they had when we were kids because oh i love them because they had like um bubblicious and have above those and they started out with just the regular flavors but then they came out with these wild concoctions where you could get two flavors in one and they would have like a a pink and a yellow and that lemonade they'd like strawberry lemonade i think they had a banana they did that cotton candy that's good it's my favorite so far it's very good it is delicious and i love i just love them the sweetness and that one is the sweetest ones out there oh yeah and it just keeps actually the best tasting one the flavor just keeps rolling out of it it's not like like a jaw like that bazooka gum if you buy bazooka if the flavor is gone in about 15 seconds yeah and it's hard it's hard yes it's terrible this it's just the flavor keeps coming now this is the grape uh it's actually it says ground ball grape um this was around um in my childhood grape was always too strong for me and this is some purple gum i'm trying to get some out of it tends to be a little stuck in there depending on how much heat it had around it oh yeah that's the grape i want brushroll [Applause] that is awesome [Applause] see how i would i still think it's too strong you ever since we met heaven has always said i don't like grape don't care for grape well i don't like grape like kool-aid or gum and stuff like that right we've had grape that he's really liked but this is the grape you don't like it's very very strong and i absolutely love it that's that takes the place i mean it's like grape juice right oh it's awesome and i'm getting little bitty pieces it's very artificial oh yeah it's very strong and i could just gobble up that whole thing i love it so definitely if you like grape then you'll like you would like it that takes my place for number one now all the rest of these we definitely haven't had slammers i might have had watermelon at one point in time i've had watermelon in those other bubblegum not uh not this okay this one this one's gonna loose it's not stuck together yeah and i can tell you why i haven't bought it in so long because you get to a point or i did that you want something that you can quickly take out of your purse and put in your mouth or your backpack and this got to be to where i didn't want to be seen in public even at 11 and 12 years old to be pulling all this out and shoving it in my mouth and so it was easier just to pop a piece of hubba bubba you know in my mouth i like the strawberry it's good it's very strong very very strong flavor that's one thing i'm impressed with now we're not doing the the long chew and letting you know how long it lasts or anything but i can save the additional flavors for the first few minutes it's terrific it tastes like strawberry candy it does yeah now wow this is bluer than the cotton candy yeah that's blue this is blue raspberry it looks like play-doh blue play-doh look at the pipe this is the cotton candy and this is the blue raspberry wow that's strong it's awesome it's very strong though i love that it's good you know what you're getting that's for sure and that is like candy too mm-hmm i wonder how much the whole bag is oh 20 servings the 200. 200 calories for the whole bug i don't think that's bad i love that so far my favorites are the cotton candy the grape and the blue rose spoon because they're so strong that's what i like about them um i want something strong okay watermelon i have a feeling that you're going to really like that stuff i don't know i thought it's really sour and this is green but i bet that's even greener it's like more of a fluorescent ring okay it smells good [Applause] i love the pictures on the brown purple [Applause] i'm wondering though i haven't actually seen a kid with this in forever um no i haven't either i'm sure they're still buying it because it's still out there yeah but i'm wondering we don't see kids just running around either we're not in places where we're seeing kids in the park or that's true you know that's good but it's not as strong as i was thinking it would be no but it's still it's very very good i don't like i said i love the texture of this it says good and soft it's very soft yeah because like you said like bazooka and some of the other like bubble gums um they start hard and they stay tough the whole time yeah they're hard and they lose their flavor so quickly like even i know we're only doing this for a second for the review for you all but even during that time a piece of bazooka would be gone the flavor would be gone you'd be ready to move on or add a piece to your mouth which i did this is actually lighter i thought it would be darker like the raspberry and the cotton candy and i thought it would it would be darker it's lighter okay [Applause] there's definitely some tartness there because it's sour apple [Applause] i'm surprised i like the tartness but that they don't have a lemonade they've been light at some point a lemonade or pink lemonade i'm surprised that they didn't do um they did hot chocolate for winter i'm surprised they didn't do peppermint maybe they tried all those it just did they didn't work i don't know i don't like that because it's got an artificial chemically kind of flavor i don't mind it um but i can see where it would be kevin's favorite because it doesn't taste like real apple at all i mean it's totally fake oh it's very very like it's very chemical but it is chewing gum it is bubble gum i still like it that's the one i would buy again i would absolutely grape this number number one grape is number one cotton candy is my number two blue raspberry is my number three those are my top three now you pick your top three i would do cotton candy's number one just the original would be my number two okay and then probably the watermelon would be my number three okay but we both agree the cotton candy is up there cotton candy yeah so if they were a dollar fifty which i don't think is bad at all because you get a lot um so if you if you like cotton candy already you know how sweet that tastes and you can only afford to buy one bag or you only want to try out one bag if you've seen this your whole life and you've never had it um then i would yeah definitely the cotton candy's safe but i tell you what if you like if you like grape at all i think it's awesome it's not a super sticky gum either no no i'm wondering if if uh gavin and emma will like this i don't know if they should go i know i don't know if if gum is something that either parents seem to be really really strict about and they don't want their kids to have it really or they just don't care i don't think christina and ander care if they have it i just don't think so they got something they buy yeah i just don't think it's something they buy very often so i don't know what gavin would be would think about it but we'll have to get them to try so tell us your experience with with uh big league chew maybe you know the history more than we do maybe you know if they've tried other flavors that didn't work out and they're not around anymore which is your favorite have you tried all eight i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "MWd_GxRm53w": "[Music] [Music] welcome to our health and wellness series you cannot afford to miss this video if you are concerned about your health or increasing waistline what are the two food sources that cause around 60% of health issues and single-handedly prevents you from creating your dream body in all probability you may not have guessed correctly its sugar and processed food even if you guessed correctly still you will find this video to be a real eye-opener and it will induce some powerful changes in your dietary habits do you know that sugar falls in the category of recreational and addictive substances like drugs and alcohol you may not believe the statement now but by the end of this video we promise that you will agree with it wholeheartedly as we equated sugar with addictive substances let us understand very briefly what makes these recreational substances so addictive and hazardous it's quite strange that the actual sources of any of these recreational substances were not that addictive or hazardous the problem originated only when we started to refine them let's demonstrate this with few examples fermented alcohol like wine is not as bad as refine or distilled stuff like whiskey gin or vodka another example is the very dangerous and very addictive cocaine which is also a product of refinement the refinement of coca leaves these leaves had been chewed by farmers for hundreds of years for a boost in energy without having any major health issues similarly sugar is produced by the refinement of sugar cane or beetroot juice and mixing it with refined corn starch if consumed in their natural state in moderation neither sugar canes nor Mays is either addictive or harmful can you notice a common trait in all these examples the result of refinement of the source is a higher concentration of a particular ingredient that will have an effect on your brain's reward system which makes you happy after consumption in whisky it is ethanol in cocaine it is cocoa leaves and in sugar it is the sugar cane juice the extent of refinement dictates the intensity of the effect a massive 100 kilograms of coca leaves will get you about 100 grams of cocaine it implies that the resulting material is 100 times stronger than what we started with average Indian population consumes around 85 grams of sugar every day which requires one kilogram of sugarcane stalk so the result of the refinement process is a material that's around 10 times sweeter than what you started with in order to naturally consume this much sugar you would have to chew through about one kilogram of sugarcane stalk that will come along with the goodness of fiber on the other hand table sugar is highly refined and processed as a result it is completely devoid of vitamin mineral or fiber sweet activates your reward center more than lots of other tastes we are eeveelution airy programmed to seek sweet food because sweet foods in nature are very rarely poisonous sugar and cocaine have the similar effect on the brain in terms of the release of happiness inducing chemicals like dopamine with its happiness triggering attributes combined with the irresistible sweet taste no wonder researchers have proven that sugar is eight times more addictive than cocaine as is the case with any substance abuse people addicted to sugar also exhibit the traits of increasing tolerance and withdrawal when you become tolerant to something the pleasure center of the brain produces less amount of dopamine for the similar intake of the recreational substance or activity with reduced dopamine feeling of happiness becomes less intense so more dopamine is necessary to get the same effect and you are forced to increase the quantity of the substance to get the same amount of pleasure this is tolerance which is progressive and is a common feature of every addictive substances or activities what about withdrawal people who tried to quit sugar experienced symptoms like lightheadedness headaches anxiety mood swings muscle aches and general fatigue okay so we have agreed that sugar is addictive we have also agreed that it is devoid of any nutritional value but why did we make such a tall claim that sugar is the cause of more than 60% of health related issues why are we not blaming fat at least for the obesity isn't it correct that fat supplies 9 calories per gram whereas sugar being a carbohydrate supplies just 4 calories per gram so why are we holding sugar responsible the answer lies in a hormone called insulin our body starts creating insulin the moment it identifies the presence of more than 5 gram of sugar in our blood in Ceylon is like a chef that transfers the sugar from the blood and feeds it to the cell think of insulin like a key that opens the entry to the cell so that the sugar from the blood gets absorbed inside when we eat carbohydrate our blood sugar Rises quickly Peaks quickly and falls off just as fast protein also leads to spike of sugar in blood but as you can see it's not that high The effect of fat on blood sugar is almost nil coming back to carbohydrate you can see that glucose fructose and galactose are the simplest forms any carbohydrate they are basically three different kind of simple sugar known as monosaccharide every other carbohydrate is a combination of two or more monosaccharides these monosaccharides are like three different bricks which construct everything that falls under the category of carbohydrate for example more than 10 bricks are required to produce brown rice which can be equated with a palatial house between two to 10 bricks of sugar are required to produce an apartment like pulses and wheat whereas sugar or sucrose is just like a tiny room that requires only two bricks one brick of glucose and one brick of fructose a small room takes less time to be demolished than a huge palatial building that's why sugar when consumed will be converted into glucose almost instantly when the body detects high amount of sugar in the blood it would release insulin in order to facilitate the transfer of the sugar from the blood to the cell now you can see the reason behind sugar which is a carbohydrate in essence triggers such a spike in insulin there are three storage areas for sugar in the body the first two storage areas are body cells and muscle like any storage area sugar will be stored at these two places only when they become empty for somebody who is not unwell muscle and body cells become empty of sugar as a of a strenuous activity or endurance training or strength training the third storage area is liver where a small percentage of sugar is stored as a backup reserved liver supplies sugar to muscle and body cells when they become empty and there is no supply of food we would use the knowledge we have acquired about carbohydrate metabolism and sugar storage to understand the most powerful concept in nutrition and body transformation so let's assume we have not performed any strenuous activity or resistance training during the day however we decided to eat a meal which was high in sugar or simple carbs such sugary stuff would trigger instant insulin spike in the body after this we were still hungry and ate chicken with brown rice and some salad though our healthy meal 100% of the carbohydrate 50% of the protein and 10% of the fat will be converted into sugar the body would check if the three storage areas of sugar which are cells muscle and liver need any sugar replenishment as we were lazy during the day the sugar storage was full to the brink this is known as excess sugar now we are in a state of spiked insulin and excess sugar here comes the most astonishing fact about sugar metabolism excess sugar will be converted into fat in the presence of insulin once again let me repeat excess sugar will be converted into fat in presence of insulin this is probably the most important nutritional concept that you will ever learn now where do you think all this fat gets stored easy it gets stored in the belly region if the consumption of sugar is still not controlled body will keep on producing more insulin and the cells will develop a resistance to them this is called insulin resistance it's exactly the way you lose the interest to talk when somebody does not stop talking as a result of insulin resistance now the key which used to open the door to the cell earlier is not functioning and hence the sugar from the blood starts getting stored in the belly region as fat so the belly keeps on increasing in size at the expense of cells which get deprived of energy the lack of energy is perceived by the brain as hunger and therefore you land up heating more and the cycle continues that's why guys sugar is so bad for anybody who wants to live healthy or lose fat we have seen how sugar gets converted to fat in presence of insulin though majority of the fat gets stored in belly some fat is stored in liver as well if not controlled accumulation of fat may leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver 10% of alcohol gets metabolized in our brain therefore we experience the feeling of getting drunk and know when to stop drinking on the contrary 100% of the sugar has to be metabolized by our poor liver and the worst thing brain does not realize when to stop eating the metabolic stress created on the liver while trying to metabolize either sugar or alcohol produces loads of toxins these toxins are responsible for inflicting damage to liver and kidney though sugar can cause similar if not more damage than alcohol to the liver it's the alcohol that takes the blame for liver issues because alcohol makes you feel drunk unlike sugar also there is societal barrier that prevents frequent daily consumption of alcohol while sugar can be consumed anytime anywhere so there is a greater chance for sugar to cause more damage than alcohol there is an Australian documentary that sugar film where the filmmaker Damon goes on an experimental high sugar diet for 30 days despite consuming the same amount of calories but increasing his sugar intake he gained eight point five kilograms in 30 days and by the 18th day he already had developed fatty liver disease listen to Robert Lustig who is the biggest factor to bring the ill effect of sugar to light he demonstrated with hundreds of studies how sugar was responsible for triggering chronic metabolic diseases now you wouldn't think twice about not giving your kid a Budweiser but you don't think twice about giving your kid a can of coke but they're the same sugar is poison it is a chronic dose dependent Pepito liver toxin he supported his statements with 16 years of studies research papers and clinical trials now what about processed food what makes processed food as bad as sugar well the answer lies in the word process a processed food is any food that has been altered through grinding freezing or sophisticated cooking methods or complex industrial process the primary objective of the processing is to improve the taste value of the finished food obviously if a food manufacturer wants to succeed and get people to buy their product it has to taste good our appetite gravitates towards foods that are sweet salty and fatty therefore processed food had been engineered to be loaded with sugar and fat during the late 90s however ever since the low-fat craze our food supply has become loaded with added sugar food companies very smartly take the fat out of the product so that it can be marketed as low-fat and then put sugar in where the fat was so the product still tastes good in fact the companies found out that you can make almost anything tastes better by putting some sugar in it the Bliss point is a term the food industry uses to describe the point at which a product is most likeable for the majority of consumers so the Bliss point is going to be the point at which the maximum amount of sugar has been added before the product becomes too sweet this includes anything from bread to Pete's a source to salad dressing sugar is cheap makes the users addictive to the taste and that's why it's usage is increasing in every processed food with increasing awareness about health the food companies use all the marketing gimmicks to mislead health-conscious population so that they don't pay any attention to sugar terms like extra protein zero added sugar low fat and added vitamins are all coined to make the health conscious people fall prey to buying the product which are fattening and addictive in some cases synthetic vitamins and minerals are added to the foods to compensate for what was lost during processing synthetic nutrients can never be a replacement for the nutrients found in whole foods if you look at the ingredients label for a processed packaged food chances are that you won't have a clue what some of the ingredients are that's because many of the ingredients in there aren't actual food they are artificial chemicals that are added for various purposes this is an example of a processed food a high protein bar which is actually marketed as a low carb friendly health food I don't know what this is but it most certainly isn't food let's not forget that real foods contain much more than just the standard vitamins and minerals that we're all familiar with real foods like plants and animals contain thousands of other trace nutrients that science is just beginning to grasp maybe one day we will invent a chemical blend that can replace all these nutrients but until that happens the only way to get them in your diet is to eat whole unprocessed foods during the processing even the good complex carbohydrate is converted into simple sugar and protein becomes unusable for our body all this sugar coming from simple carbohydrate which originally came from a complex source apart from added sugar leads to huge insulin spike and high amount of fat ensures that such spike is maintained for a very long time it implies that after eating processed food your body goes into fat storage mode and remains in that state for a longer time that's why there is a higher probability for a person habituated of eating processed food to store fat even after eating something healthy like chicken and brown rice even the protein loses its true purpose of building the tissue and muscle and just ends up supplying empty calories also the process of refinement removes or reduces fiber from the food fiber is a buffer that reduces the insulin spike in fact many time the fiber is intentionally removed from processed food in order to increase its consumption and habit-forming traits now there are people who are aware about the ill effect of sugar and they refrain from having Coke and desserts but they still overdose on sugar without even realizing it everybody is aware about sugar and high fructose corn syrup therefore food companies slide sugar in processed food under the disguise of 54 different names just to make you feel better but they are all sugar in essence so we suggest you to read the label carefully before buying any item from the supermarket and discard it if it has a camouflaged name of sugar do not forget that every McDonald KFC or Pizza Hut products are either loaded with sugar directly or gets metabolized into sugar within no time post consumption because of excessive refinement remember how an apartment can be demolished easily as compared to a palatial building listen to Michael Moss who is a Pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter mas is explosive empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous I openin research the food industry is extremely secretive competitive and proprietary it took years and hundreds of interviews before Michael Moss could finish his book this was like a detective story for me getting inside the companies with thousands of pages of inside documents and getting their scientists and executives to reveal to me the secrets of how they go at this what did he find that the food processing industry rests on three pillars salt sugar and fat well these are the Holy Trinity of processed foods and again when they hit the perfect amounts they call it the Bliss point for sugar the mouthfeel for fat the flavor burst for salt they know that their products will be irresistible now let us drift into a controversial subject of home-cooked food can home-cooked food be unhealthy the purist may hate us for the answer but the truth is that even home-cooked food can be unhealthy let me prove this as we know now any method that alters the food to improve its taste is called processing now it's not just complex industrial process even unhealthy cooking methods can convert bunch of healthy food sources to unhealthy food which can be as bad as processed food overcooking frying and mixing food from different sources while cooking other major reasons for our Indian food to lose its nutritional value for example while preparing fish fry or chicken butter masala at home utilizing unhealthy cooking methods protein from meat sources capable of being used by the body to repair or build muscle gets either reduced or even eliminated such food though prepared with quality protein source just ends up supplying lots of empty calories excessive cooking like commercial processing makes it very easy for the body to metabolize such food such easy and rapid metabolization results into high insulin spike isn't this similar to the effect of consuming processed food any protein is made up of 21 amino acids and many of them cannot sustain excessive cooking and heat like protein unhealthy cooking methods even converts complex carbohydrate into an easily digestible state similar to simple sugar carbon dioxide is released in our body when it's trying to metabolize excessive sugar carbon dioxide is responsible for making us feel bloated and gaseous this might explain the reason to be bloated after eating poori but not roti made up of similar amount of wheat dough whole wheat is a complex carbohydrate but the process of frying converts it into a form which is quite similar to simple sugar we may not add extra sugar or chemicals while cooking at home but that's not a sufficient criteria for a food to be characterized as healthy and nutritious while cooking at home we may be guilty of pulverizing whole grains over cooking the meat and cooking the vegetables until it becomes soggy all this taste improvement mechanism unfortunately makes our food easily digestible caloric dense and extremely low in nutrition do not assume that processing only implies addition of chemicals and just because you are not adding any chemical to home-cooked food they are superior to processed or restaurant food it will not be too difficult for us to look around and notice our family members who hardly eat so-called processed or junk food but still struggling with obesity and addictive eating syndrome doesn't this indicate that simply cooking at home is not a guarantee for the food to be healthy we can safely conclude at least technically that home-cooked food can be as bad as processed food if wrong cooking methods eliminates its nutrition increases the calorie per bite and causes insulin spike post consumption so the bottom line is that the hyper rewarding and insulin triggering nature of food can be induced both in a manufacturing plant or at home and that's why some people can literally become addicted to this stuff and completely lose control over their consumption the intense dopamine release that occurs in the brain when they eat these foods can easily defeat their defense mechanism and make them eat much more than they need although food addiction is something that most people don't know about we are convinced that it is a huge problem in society today so we have learnt until now that food is processed to enhance the taste and in the process nutrition goes out of the consideration so does it mean that a healthy food needs to be tasteless of course not if the food does not taste good it can never be a part of our long-term dietary choice you just need to be mindful to avoid processed and sugary food our recipes that make your dream body are carefully designed to retain the nutritional value of the ingredients without compromising with taste we recommend you to watch our recipe videos to prepare delicious food which can even enhance your performance and improve health a small bit of clarification is required about fruits here whole fruits also contain fructose but do not treat fruits at par with table sugar unlike table sugar fruits are neither processed nor refined unless you consume them in the form of juice whole fruits are loaded with fiber which reduces the rate of intestinal absorption meaning your liver can easily handle the steady stream of sugar from a piece of fruit the fiber will also fill you up so for apples might be actually a lot of food to take in in one sitting but you can get four whole apples worth of sugar delivered to your liver in a few seconds from one glass of apple juice which will lead to huge insulin spike refinement of fruit required to produce fruit juice Rob's off vitamins minerals and fiber from the fruit and what we consume now is very similar to sugar and therefore we advise you to strictly avoid fruit juices even if they claim to have zero added sugar however like any other food source fruits are the source of calories as well and therefore be mindful of not exceeding your set caloric intake by over indulging it's very common to see people gaining weight over mangoes and dates to have an idea we have given the calorie content of some common fruits you also need to learn to eat the fruits in a right way to maximize its benefit fruits should be consumed on an empty stomach it is best to have fruits two hours prior or two hours later after having anything eating fruit in this way will help the body to process the nutrients fiber and sugar properly this prevents fermentation of fruits in our digestive system most importantly you will avoid sugar getting converted to fat in presence of insulin spike through fructose from fruit eating fruit this way prevents any digestive discomfort fruit as a snack in between major meal is the best way of consuming them also against the conventional wisdom it's best to avoid fruits as a breakfast your body has been fasting and the sugar in the fruit will spike your insulin and you will become hungry very soon let me give you another piece of good news insulin spike is not always bad in fact we need a spike of insulin after resistance or weight training post weight training protein is the go-to nutrient to repair and rebuild the loss of proteins from our muscle cells protein also provides the building blocks required to build new muscle tissue we know that insulin is a chef that transfers sugar in the cell of a person having normal metabolism now insulin also acts as a carrier to transfer protein into the cell without insulin absorption of protein is reduced drastically therefore the best time to spike your insulin is after wake training while consuming protein insulin is consumed helping in protein absorption into the cells rather than converting sugar into fat so now the question is what kind of carbs should you use to spike your insulin after a workout well you know how there are good carbs and bad carbs as it turns out this is actually the only time when good cups and bad carbs switch roles meanings typical good Cubs like roti oatmeal brown rice etc contain fiber and other nutrients that slow down its digestion and insulin spike this is exactly what makes them good any other time of the day but by now you know the post-workout meal is all about insulin spike to help in protein absorption therefore foods like honey white potatoes white rice or a cereal like cornflakes are all good choices for a carb source after a workout post-workout you should consume around 25% to 30% of total daily carbohydrate intake or roughly 25 to 30 grams of carbohydrate total daily allocated carbohydrate implies carbohydrate from all sources including good or bad carb you should not think that your workout has you have the license to eat more than you're allocated budget of carbohydrate protein nor fat my favorite carbohydrate source post-workout consists of four dates along with a handful of raisin apart from spiking my insulin without majorly contributing towards my daily caloric intake it takes care of my sweet tooth as well here is the insulin index of few common food source insulin index indicates the extent of the spike that you get from the food you can select any of the food item from the list there's a post-workout carbohydrate source if it score more than 75% also it's important to avoid fat while spiking the insulin because fat slows down the insulin and digestion therefore having a desert-like rasgulla or cake or even ice cream is strictly not recommended even as a post-workout meal they are processed high in fat and most importantly very high in calorie - post-workout nutrition is very important we will surely do another exhaustive video very soon about pre and post-workout meal don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel and join our Facebook page so that you never miss any of our videos as we have been talking about dopamine and reward circuit a lot let me tell you that getting a dopamine high and activation of reward circuit in brain is not bad if the source is healthy and soul-stirring in fact in our modern society when depression is on a high it's really important for us to identify and pursue at least few healthy activities that are capable of activating our reward circuit physical activities like resistance training or endurance activities are the most effective source of activating the reward circuit in our brain pursuing a passion bonding session with best buddies and commitment to a social cause are examples of healthy activities that promotes dopamine release in abundance to figure out healthy activities that provides you eternal happiness and if you have already identified them pursue them regularly so that they become a part of your habitual routine if an honest self introspection has revealed that currently not even a single activity is capable of releasing happiness chemicals in your brain then it is surely a cause for concern and you must address it at the earliest one last topic of this video is a comparison between sugar and few other supposedly healthy substitute of sugar let's go back to science to see if they are really healthy our comparison is going to be between sugar honey Indian jaggery and artificial sweetener like equal and Splenda Indian jaggery is popularly known as Gore Indian jaggery is an unrefined sugar made by boiling concentrated sugarcane extract until it hardens we will compare all the four sweet stuff on four parameters the parameters are calorie density nutrition profile impact on insulin spike and addiction inducing traits let's start with the first parameter of calorie density which is the amount of calories per gram that a product has for visual ease our paracin criteria shall be 1tsp of every product which is roughly around five grams one teaspoon of sugar gives 19 calories honey gives 18 calories jaggery provides 19 calories and artificial sweetener gives zero calorie which is not a big surprise let's check the nutrition profile now needless to say sugar has zero vitamin mineral and fiber constitutionally honey is a bit different from sugar sugars are generally half glucose and half fructose honey is a larger proportion of fructose honey comes from a more natural unadulterated source it does contain nutrients and antioxidants but I won't go into the details of what they are because when consumed at two to three teaspoons a day these nutrients are present in just trace amounts so nutritionally if you seek to reap the benefits of honey you'd need to consume about a glass every day in which case you can kiss weight loss goodbye given its composition it has many allied benefits - from curing coughs to healing wounds nutrition profile is an area where jaggery is definitely superior at 100 grams it gives 61% of the recommended daily allowances or RDA of iron 30% RDA of magnesium 30% RDA of potassium and 20% RDA of manganese however considering that you should not exceed 15 grams of daily consumption of sugar from all the sources put together you can't afford to count on jaggery for getting these nutrients instead eat spinach please but at 5 grams to 15 grams jaggery is definitely better than having the same amount of sugar artificial sweetener has off-course no nutrition profile when it comes to insulin spiking traits sugar and jaggery are exactly the same glycemic index is the scale that measures insulin spike sugar and jaggery both have the glycemic index of 68 honey is slightly better at GI of 55 artificial sweetener are worse than sugar when it comes to insulin spike research has established that majority of the artificial sweeteners available in market raises the insulin drastically in fact artificial sweetener are almost 10 times sweeter than table sugar moving on to the last parameter of habit inducing trait well since all the four stuff are sweet causes more or less similar insulin spike they possess almost the similar capability of releasing happiness triggering chemicals in the brain and therefore all the four products can cause addiction interestingly stevia is the only artificial sweetener which is different from all other product in this category as it comes from plant it's insulin spiking trait is insignificant and therefore it can help you in your battle against sugar addiction but again we do not recommend the usage of more than two stevia on a daily basis so what's the verdict work on reducing your sweet and processed food craving that's the only reliable long-term method to getting fit and staying so disease doesn't happen with one meal but it happens with a thousand but that's what we have because now sugar is with every meal getting rid of sugar addiction may seem difficult or even impossible for the initial three weeks but once the positive transformation like higher energy reducing waist line etc becomes dominant your craving for wrong food will start diminishing positive transformation is more addictive than sweet after all thanks for watching guys please do subscribe to our YouTube channel and join our Facebook group for more videos

the day then you should be trying almonds almonds are rich in vitamin C magnesium potassium phosphorus so they even help against warding off the onset of osteoporosis the other thing is that almonds have got two vital brain nutrients inside riboflavin and l-carnitine that helps to reduce our risk of later onset of Alzheimer's almonds are also great as the almond meal can be used as a substitute to flour grating cookies and cakes so versatile so give them a go great snack during the day awesome sweet potatoes I love sweet potatoes and did you know that they have the lowest glycemic index of all starchy potatoes they're rich in B vitamins in C and D they're high in calcium because they're low in GI glycemic index it helps us to manage our blood sugar levels they've also got cancer-fighting properties now one of the key things you've got to remember with sweet potatoes is the potential of all of its nutrients is actually held in the skin not just the flesh of the potato so if you haven't tried sweet potatoes before you're missing out go out give them a go these little blue warriors are packed with such a punch they help to fight against cancer they help to minimize our later onset of dementia and Alzheimer's and if you don't like broccoli too much then these little warriors have the same amount of antioxidants as two and a quarter cups of broccoli but they also help to help balance our blood sugar levels they help to minimize our risk of diabetes you can use them in salads by themselves or in smoothies they make a great snack there are so many different things that you can use blueberries for I really do encourage you to give them a go oh and one more thing what was that they're great for memory loss better have a few more huh eggs are an amazing superfood in my opinion they're an essential food they are one of the foods that the body finds the absolute easiest to digest a complete protein they have all 22 amino acids in the rich in vitamin A D and K those essential fat soluble vitamins and one of the key things I want you to remember about eggs is you must buy them organically because the fatty acids in them the omega-3 and omega-6 when you buy them organically then you get the best ratios and don't forget to eat the whole egg don't go separating it and just having the egg white it's meant to come together your body needs good quality fat found in the egg yolk in order to metabolize the protein in the egg white that's why it comes together in one of nature as a whole food one more little message for you how do you know if an egg is actually fresh well if it sinks it's fresh if it floats it's not there we go so if eggs aren't a regular part of your diet then it is time to make them so have you tried manuka honey yet well up until recently I hadn't either it comes from New Zealand and from what I've read about it it has really high topical wound healing properties its antibacterial antiviral and antimicrobial so there's a couple of different ways we can actually use it we can ingest it enjoy the sweetness of honey also we can put it topically on top of our skin what I've also learn about manuka honey is that it comes with a rating so the higher the rating the more active the medicine or properties are so if you've got a burn or a little bit of skin irritation why don't you give it a go or better still like me pop it in a little cup of tea and just a little sweetener are you looking for a way in which you can enhance your performance or even your endurance then perhaps it's time to try some cheer seeds they are an amazing source of omega-3 and omega-6 which in the body helps us to fight inflammation and pain some sources of chia seeds even boost up to eight times more omega-3 than even salmon packed with antioxidants and minerals it also helps to boost detoxification boost our energy levels and also our clarity and thought I use it in a couple of different ways you've got chia seeds here in their natural whole form which as you can see are quite small but you can also purchase chia seeds in a more milled ground form now cheer seeds are great in smoothies you can use the powder form in cakes in muffins and biscuits but for me in the morning if I'm needing that little extra boost then all I do is get some of the whole seed pop it on top of my smoothie [Music] and away I go quinoa have you tried it yet it's fast becoming a great alternative as a gluten-free option it's packed with antioxidants it's a great source of plant protein so it helps to regulate our cholesterol levels can help to regulate your blood sugar levels lowering the risk of diabetes and it's a great energy booster and as you can see it comes in three different colors you've got your white your black and more of your ready brown and you can cook it just in some water or even in some stock it's a great alternative to rice as an example to have with curries and it also makes just a great salad option so if you haven't tried it yet give it a go are you somebody who finds they catch colds easily then perhaps it's time to up your intake of garlic rich in vitamin C manganese and b6 it's known for its antibiotic and its antibacterial properties it helps to ward off flu and symptoms of colds it's also a great immune booster now you may laugh but I've tried this myself I've crushed up some garlic and I've actually put them into a sock at night and put the socks on and gone to bed believe it or not in the morning my stink of garlic coming out of my skin but the flu symptoms have gone the symptoms of the cold have gone so try it it's not just for vampires so it's chocolate really good for us well like most foods it's all about the quality and the quantity here I've got some beautiful organic raw cacao powder it's rich in magnesium which is great for mental health and is a great source of the amino acid tryptophan which we need to produce serotonin known as the happy brain hormone I'm going to show you how to put together a really simple easy healthy chocolate mousse into the blender whole avocado three dates which I've just soaked and taken the Pips out just a couple of tablespoons of cacao powder a little bit of maple syrup as a little sweetener last of all organic vanilla pop the lid on this can be done at home so easy a great alternative to your processed high sugar mooses and the kids will love it and you know what it's so much healthier for them give it a go it's this easy if you're pregnant then avocados are great for you so rich in folate for the developing baby but even if you're not they are packed with antioxidants vitamin C K and E and potassium and they have a great balance of anti-inflammatory fatty acids and you know what I use them in salads all the time I even make an amazing chocolate mousse with them you would not believe that there was avocados in them give them a go if you're feeling a little tired overweight even a little bit Moody then acai berries have to be tried they're native to the Amazon rainforest have been used for a hundred years for their therapeutic and healing health tonics acai berries are rich in antioxidants full of magnesium potassium copper iron a great balance of a meager six and a mega nine now the best form to get them in is a freeze-dried form and of course organic now to make the very most of a say what we can do is create a beautiful breakfast as a simple smoothie all we need to make sure is to get the therapeutic value is that we're using between 500 to a thousand milligrams per serve we just need three tablespoons of acai powder some fresh organic coconut water some frozen raspberries one banana and the coconut pulp pop that into a blender [Music] look at that [Music] ah now that's the energy boost to start the day with kale I call it the holy grail of superfoods it is an amazing vegetable packed with fiber with antioxidants vitamins and minerals this is a real immune boosting food it's also a great source of your omega-3 to omega-6 full of fiber kale also contains more calcium per calorie than milk and it's more easily absorbed than any other dairy product so many different ways in which you can have it my favorite is to steam it shred it off the stalks steamed it over some water and then lashings of butter you can't go wrong does your body feel like it's in need of a bit of a detox then in that case make sure you add some broccoli into your cleanse program it's packed with vitamin C A and K and folic acid recent research has shown that it actually helps with all three stages of the detoxification process activation neutralization and elimination it also helps to regulate our cholesterol levels and has some very unique anti-inflammatory properties in it to help the body ward off pain and inflammation so many different ways you can use broccoli in salads as just a vegetable on the side and make sure that if you are just steaming broccoli and having it by itself that you add some butter to it because the vitamins A and K are after all fat soluble vitamins give it a go it's one of my favorite vegetables see what you think if you're feeling stressed or adrenal fatigue then you need to boost your levels of good-quality fat and protein butter is a source of really good quality fat so long as it's organic it's filled with vitamins A D and K it helps to support adrenal function and thyroid function it helps us to combat our levels of stress in the body because it's such a good source of dietary cholesterol these are not butter and you probably if you open your fridge this is what you're more likely to find in your cupboards these days move over to the real thing try butter you will never go back to the imitation again [Music] Olive Oyl famous for its used in the Mediterranean diet but what is the latest research telling us about olive oil well some studies are saying that it may be used in the prevention of our Simon's it's a rich mono saturated oil rich in antioxidants and vitamin E it's been seen to reduce our risk of obesity reduce the risk of diabetes and it helps the body to ward off oxidative stress one thing we've got to be careful of is that we don't use it for too high temperatures in cooking so about 50 degrees is perfect anything above then you're going to oxidize the oil and the facts are going to turn rancid so give it a go it's really easy to make your own homemade salad dressings using olive oil and if you're going to use it for cooking then just make sure your temperatures aren't too high bee pollen is one of nature's most nourishing foods it's the food of the young bees and funny enough it contains almost all the nutrients we need as human beings surprisingly bee pollen contains more protein than any other animal source it contains more amino acids than beef eggs and cheese of equal weight [Music] bee pollen comes in granule form and is taken at meal times it works particularly well when taken with fruit the fruit fibers called Raw Hemi cellulose reinforce the activity of the fresh pollen all of course you could do what I've chosen to do and that's a really lovely simple easy winter salad now you can do this and serve it warm or you can pre prepare it and actually serve it chilled so what I have here is some quinoa that I have soaked the night before remember please it's it's a good thing to always soak we want to neutralize the phytic acid which means the digestive system can actually take on all that lovely nutrition the next part of the dish on my roast veggies now I've just popped my head into the fridge and I've just found out whatever I've got left over that's great for roasting I've chosen some aubergine some parsnips and carrots and some leeks and I've chopped them up into small little pieces and put some sea salt over them into the oven and softly roasted them now the herbs that I've chosen are chives and some I'm gonna top with some beautiful roasted walnuts and then of course bee pollen granules on top so when you're choosing your bee pollen it's a really good idea to choose a multi-floral pollen you'll be able to see that because all the granules will be lots of different colors that are actually representing all the different floral pollens contained in the granules okay so let's just put it together [Music] it takes one be working 8 hours a day for an entire month to gather just one teaspoon of these granules now in each pellet there are over 2 million flower pollen grains and in a teaspoon there are over 2.5 billion they taste great they're good for you so give them a go most people think of bees they think of honey but did you know that bees are essential for the well-being of our entire planet in fact without these little insects 30% of the world's crops and 90% of wild plants would die these could also be our immune systems secret weapon and today we're going straight to the source to learn more about bees than just honey [Music] so Peter tell me what exactly is propolis propolis well we might have a quick look at propolis and I can show you what we call in the bee world bee glue or as we call it the cement of the hive this is what we called propolis this is found in amazing little quantities all around any bee hive have a look at that have a feel of that propolis every single morning these little worker bees they escape out their little hole here which is the front and they head off to the nearest village well the village for them is the forest and they what they're at looking for is the resin that comes from the leaf bulbs so the bees get this they chew this they take this in the way home as they chew it it combines with some enzymes in their tummy when they come back they start to create little bits of poly filler so basically propolis is a combination of lovely tree resin and B enzymes in their tummy and we call that propolis so what exactly do we use propolis for well we use it for a lot of different reasons and we found that the medicinal qualities for propolis is incredible it's got this antifungal and antibacterial nature to it but a really important one is it boosts our immune system so we take that as an oral capsule which is fantastic so it gives us a different energy because it gives us a okay an ongoing immune system boost so there's lots of different sort of nature's that you can use it for yes so I'm dying to ask in that case Peter what does it taste like what does it taste like well if I said to you taste a bit like savile on cream bit like antiseptic there's a nature of antiseptic in it because of the antifungal and the antibacterial nature what it does is it actually numbs and actually sort of desensitizes our taste buds because it's quite a strong flavor yet Wow amazing amazing this really is a miracle a miracle food so we've seen where propolis comes from but exactly how does it work it's the high concentration of flavonoids in populus that is key to its health benefits now flavonoids are these awesome antioxidants that are even more powerful than vitamin C e zinc and psyllium you find these flavonoids in foods like berries and citrus fruits even red wine and in high concentrations in propolis now this is great for fighting off infection and also inflammation and an added bonus to these antioxidant activities in the body is that they help to ward off the free radical damage which causes degeneration and disease in the body so there's many different forms propolis comes in it can be taken orally or topically on the skin so first up let's have a look at the capsules taken daily they're a great way of supporting and boosting the immune system now remember over 60% of your immune system lives in your digestive system so it also helps in the whole process of not just boosting the immune system but aiding digestion as well secondly we have the liquid drops that you can either take again orally in a little bit of water a few drops or you can put directly onto the skin now remember the properties that are antibacterial antimicrobial this is fantastic for fighting gum disease great for you know skin infections really powerful healing agents always consult your doctor and of course a good diet the right amount of exercise and enough sleep are essential but propolis could really add an extra boost to your immune system just another way in which bees are helping us along the path to better health", "3j5Qe4EHdj8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what is up everyone hello hello hello

so you got to work sometimes on the weekend I have a lot of work to do this weekend as well but that's okay that's okay so first off before we get into anything I have an awesome announcement to you all to everyone watching if you're watching on the replay this is an announcement for you as well I am releasing a new line of concentrates new line of one-shots and it's super duper simple so let me explain really quickly you can head over to ecig express comm and pick up the new annual reck law lair line right now if there's only one right now there's only elizabeth's Kuster but you're gonna get two more you're gonna be getting a candy starburst enhancer so basically any sort of fruits that you like you just drip this little enhancer in there boom it tastes like starburst you're also hopefully going to be getting another one that well you are gonna be getting another one it's just hopefully it's soon it's taking me a little bit longer than than I'd like to finish this last recipe but the first one's done and we're just gonna be releasing that one really soon right now the one that's released is Elizabeth's custard which is my traditional vanilla third it's a one-shot as well so you can mix this up at it's recommended percentage I think it's thirteen and a half percent is what I recommend it at it's probably it's definitely on the bottle I don't know I guess it's not in here either but essentially just a very traditional simple vanilla coaster is delicious and you can vape it on its own or you can use it as a layer or as a flavoring and you know drip on top of it put your favorite fruits on top maybe you want to put it into a bakery it's meant to be mixed with to kind of bridge the gap between people who like one-shots and they're new they just mix up the one shot they give it a shake and they vape but maybe they want to start getting into tweaking things then now there's the layer line which will help kind of bridge that gap and then hopefully move them over into the more advanced side right now they're really getting into you know individual flavorings flavor profiles and then so on and so forth so so forth excuse me so I think what's really cool is that if you come to DIY or die for your DIY information you want to learn how to mix you want to learn how to get into this stuff I basically have products as well as information videos and podcasts every single step of the way so we're talking from the person who doesn't even know how to mix they've never mixed before they never they don't know what to do you have all the information that you need on my website all the videos there's podcast dedicated to that and now there's products as well as the one-shots so that'll get you to buying one shots that'll actually get you to mixing it right putting the VG the PG your one shot in shaking it and then you have a delicious product say you want to take another little step you're not ready to fully jump headfirst in there you want to take a little you know you want to go slowly well now we have the layer products and there's also videos podcasts information to kind of bridge that gap as well then you want to get into the advanced side and you want to start making your own recipes I'll guess I would call that the more I would guess I would call that the more advanced side right that when you start making your own recipes then you're you're on the advanced side but you're not necessarily on the professional side so you have the the beginner the the sort of novice and then the advanced and then if you do want professional information if you want to learn how to about learn about creating recipes for commercial clients or creating recipes for your commercial company all that stuff there's also information videos podcasts as well all dedicated towards every single aspect of mixing from that from the the littlest person who knows nothing all the way to the person who can mix up anything right you have information as well as product all across the board I would love to release it you know products products could cater towards professionals who make money in the industry or aiming to make money in the industry it's just a little bit difficult on trying essentially I would have to create a flavoring line I would need my own flavorings for that but I don't know if I have the logistics that manpower since it's just myself to do that at this current moment so I figure let's focus on the novices let's put out the one shots people have been loving them a lot of people have just been using those just to mix you know they just get the one shots they vape it they go that's their recipes that they know they can count on if they don't feel like dabbling and try you know failing at recipes or tweaking things it's just super easy to get something that you want to vape now we have a little bridge you have a complete layer so it's a complete recipe that's meant to be mixed so I've made I made sure that when you add stuff to it you're not over flavoring when you add stuff to it you're not going overboard you know it's it's specifically meant for other ingredients to be put on top of it so I think that's pretty cool head over to e-cig express.com pick it up 999 will get you 30 mils it's a great deal it'll last you a really long time and there's just so much more customizability to it because it is meant to be mixed I would love to do one for water melone as well maybe I'll do that a little bit later sort of like a watermelon layer just because there's not really many good watermelon flavorings out there but that's besides the point so we have this one we're gonna be having a candy enhancer candy burst bomb it's called and then a secret one that as soon as I finish I'm gonna send it over to ISA get seasick Express tell them to put it in production because I'm really excited about that one because there's nothing in the market there's nothing in the market for that profile so hopefully when that comes out you guys will be like yes finally we can we mix with this profile which I'm excited about so that's it yeah that was my little announcement there Elizabeth's custard aka Queens custard I couldn't call it Queens because there's already a Queen's custard but I kind of I'll do a little aka thing so Elizabeth's custard aka Queens custard and y'all rec log concentrates the same great quality same great ease of use same great production that you would come to expect with and y'all rec log concentrates but now as a layer of mine which i think is pretty cool and of course you can always head over to liquid barn comm pick up my tastemaker collection where you can get saw empathy on kings custard the older brother quick strawberry malted milk and water melone as well as chef's flavors if you're over in the UK and as well chefs flavors does can does have Elizabeth's custard and like I said you can see it right here in the in the description it was also this this the same recipe so it's meant to be mixed with so cool super excited about that man alright let's get into it how is it going doing this week if you have any questions you want to ask me this is a great time to ask me make sure you just tag my name in the chat at DIY or die that way I can see it a lot easier it's just it's just helpful for me feel free to ask any any questions that you have what will chat I'll try to get do my best to answer it as thoroughly as possible and I think that's it for housekeeping and making sure you guys know what's up oh and follow me on on Instagram as well I love Instagram been using it a lot been trying to tell you guys hey Instagram is the wave at DIY or dye vaping give me a follow let's chill over there alright let's see if there's any questions right now before we jump into anything gotta say you're Elizabeth custard is outstanding thank you sir Keith Wilson glad you enjoy Keith hopefully you can play around with it use it in recipes that'll really help my sales you know if you guys use my ingredients in recipes that's the best way to sell my flavorings you know so that's I spent a lot of time making sure that you guys can do that alright I got a strong distribution option for your one shots here down under PM me I think I already saw your PM I just have to get back to you've been really busy today but I saw that and and I will I will contact you please bring your candy enhancer to chefs I definitely will definitely will yo may how do you overcome not being motivated to mix lately I've been mixing one shots because I'm just too lazy to come up with something new yeah and that seems to be a lot of people recently have been saying that to me they've been saying hey man I just use your one shots and I don't really mix anymore I've kind of just lost motivation for it and the only way you can really get that motivation back is to take a break just take a break you'll get move it you'll get motivated again in the future I promise you just a little break right now just don't worry about it just don't think about it one day you're gonna come along and be like damn I really I really want to try to make this thing and you'll end up getting back into it again you never forget how that makes us like riding a bike you know what I mean you always have that information in the backyard brain so don't stress don't stress too much unless you're someone who gets paid to do it every day and it's hard for you to make money then you don't really need to worry about it I like to just take a little break you know relax and I I normally enjoy like cooking stuff and and bakery stuff and food shows and websites and stuff like that I read that stuff all the time and a lot of that a lot of that a lot of the time that stuff Khanna is just like cool I wonder if I can turn that into something or if I'm just kind of hanging out I just like an idea pops in my head like like man I wonder if if I can create this profile because no one has done it before you know what I mean it's just don't take it too seriously I think once you take it too seriously which does happen in this in this hobby a lot I see it a lot once you take it too seriously then it just doesn't become fun anymore and that's when you lose the spark that's when you lose that flame and if it doesn't become fun take a break step back from it you'll come back to it eventually and then hopefully it'll be fun again but that's my best advice taking a break is vital especially if you want to like kind of regain your pallet you know if you're constantly just running around vaping all these high concentrated aromas it really does weigh down on your palate so taking a break just vapor all day vape a little bit relax and you'll come back better than ever I promise you what do you recommend for a yogurt base I'm trying to make something that tastes more like those drinkable tube yogurts flavor wise yogurt it was a lot of adapt in it unfortunately if you are someone who doesn't like it tap stay away from it flavor west yogurt is the best yogurt I tried to stay away from it as long as I could but recently I've been using it and all of my strawberries and creams it's just so good and it's not it doesn't have a sour note like TP a Greek yogurt so if you're looking for like those drinkable tube yogurts flavor west yogurt throw some strawberries sweetened they're from capella throw a bunch of sweetener in there throw some marshmallow in there boom look at my booster recipe look at my booster recipe just really leave out the Cheesecake items you know I have acquired a lot of Pina Colada concentrate what can I do to make it more interesting thanks stunts thumb try to do what does Pina Colada it's pineapple coconut and then just alcohol right so I would try to infuse with coconuts difficult cuz anything you put in coconut is gonna taste like a tropical mix so you're kind of just gonna have to exploit it maybe mix it in some papaya some some more really exotic flavors you know like papaya cactus stuff like that see what you can do there but instead of just like going run-of-the-mill Pina Colada try to really take that tropical note and run with it maybe that'll spark some motivation where did you get your shelves at I got them at IKEA they're called the K visible shelves I think they're $25 each a little bit pricey but they're worth it if you have an array I still need more - I have to do that whole bottom row like I have the wonderful avers there I have a whole box of the Losi i have purel m flavors I need to go in there just to mess this is too much too much flavors actually I do need to make an order should we make sure we order flavorings together here I think that would be a good idea I think that would help some people out ordering some flavors right I think that would help some people out so we'll do that and we'll do that in a little bit let me answer some of these questions we'll get what happened to the tastemakers series it's kind of been put on hold a little bit but you will see more of it there was there is supposed to be another episode that was already shot unfortunately there's not much to it there's just not I don't know you'll see you'll see a little bit more of that in the future but it's just been put on hold just a little bit just a little bit any suggestions for organizing your small your DIY set up in small places well this is kind of a small little office and I've been able to make it work but I do have like it's not it's not like a corner of a room like this is its own separate office so that's a little bit different like if you're working in like a small corner of a room your best bet is to maybe do something what I have here but vertical users use that vertical real estate as much as possible so stack these on top of each other vertically that way you can keep everything nice and confined and just yeah just you to utilize the verticality of your room or whatever area you're in that should help you and all you really need is like a at least like a little area of a desk with a scale on it and you really don't need much else you know if you're doing syringes you know then it's just gonna get a little bit Messier you should just get a scale in that case anyway do you have suggestions for recipes like strawberry and cream which she should strawberry from anywhere it's the only strawberry I can taste yeah there's plenty if you go on and all the flavors are illiquid recipes calm and you just search those flavors you'll find tons of recipes with with that ingredient I personally don't enjoy that strawberry as much as you might so I don't use it often I know use it often but maybe do like a gods milk look at skittles is God's milk and instead replace it with the shisha strawberry see if that because the Bavarian cream works well with she's just strawberry so try something with that is there any way to mix up a custard take a custard that tastes like store-bought ultramel custard and not the homemade coaster all coasters out there taste like we've been trying all the Tramel stuff I've been trying ultramel since I've had it when I went to South Africa last year it's a it's a really tough profile I just haven't figured it out it doesn't seem tough either when you taste the ultramel you're like oh this would be perfect as it but there's just this should we've just not done it yet that vanilla just is a is so elusive that specific cream vanilla flavor I personally think like a tiny tiny tiny touch of banana is the answer to that but the problem is is like there's still not that vanilla yeah like that vanilla cream eggy part to it it's a tough it's a tough one oh by the way to those who we've been working on the Duchess for a while we've been trying to figure it out I'm pretty sure this is an ingredient in it the buttercream by flavor-wise when you smell it you'll know what I mean when you smell it you'll know what I mean I haven't messed around with it too much yet but I'm pretty sure that is what gives Duchess that weird flavor that that quintessential Duchess flavor I have to have to play around with it but I'm letting you guys know if I come out with a duchess remix part 6 it's probably gonna include that buttercream so pick it up if you don't have it someone said how about how about a vanilla buttercream frosting for that case maybe use a Lorraine's cream cheese frosting and then use that flavor west buttercream that buttercream is actually pretty it's from what I can smell it smells great can you type that for me please about the shelves yes I can cave izl what do you think about TPA brown sugar I think it's good it's a good accent note I use it usually from like a half a percent up to maybe two percent I never use it as like a main profile it's usually just meant to kind of act as a brown sugar if I want a little bit of that deeper caramel brown sugar note I'll throw that in there a lot of bakeries utilize it sometimes in creams maybe we'll use it in this in this recipe we're gonna be mixing something with vanilla focusing on maybe we'll do the vanilla buttercream frosting today I don't know David hey Wayne much love for your content I'm a member on your website and now the PDF download is no longer available in my downloads is there a way to get it back did you just email me on that I think I just saw that maybe it was an email or if it was something else but someone else said that to me maybe it was a Facebook message after I look into that I'm dead I don't know why it wouldn't be there but someone else also said that the Downloads gone I got a double check I'll get back to you on that do you have any suggestions for 24 millimeter flavor RDAs dual coil configuration just for dripping know I don't really vape that way so unfortunately I don't I do have the new Citadel RDA if you guys have seen my my review on it let's talk about the Citadel was it's uh it's [ __ ] dope let's talk about the Citadel so here it is may bicycling the guys you do the hata Lee video the and Theon now this RDA has been on my mod since it came in and it hasn't I haven't used any other RDA other than the testing that we've done the flavor on it I don't know how they did it well I do know how I did it but I don't know how they keep doing it topping the flavor of the Hat early topping the flavor of the an Theon it's just crazy how good they are at building flavor so what they did was he didn't see the review they put this sort of Ultem chamber reducer on it you can see that and what that does is essentially just really it just the chamber but it just adds to the flavor tremendously it's crazy how good this chamber reducer works and that's what they did they basically kept the design of the hata Li the same right it sort of looks like a Hadley that just has that angled airflow that kind of comes down at the coil you know the horizontal slots on the side keeping it as tight as possible to the top of the coil and then what they did was they even they closed down even more with this chamber reducer and it just produces such a vibrant saturated dance sticky vapor it's awesome highly highly recommend it it's a little bit pricey that's $75 but you're definitely getting a quality quality product it's really great and I actually spoke to Mac the other day he called me the other day the owner of Cyclone and we chatted about the Citadel and yeah he's super proud of it he's super proud of it I'm super happy with it I think it's their best product yet I don't know how they're gonna top this like I really don't know how much further they can go unless they can figure out something where they can keep the same flavor but maybe do it maybe in an RDA that's like a cloud chasing RDA I don't know I don't know how they can top this so they might have to try to you know reach it but I don't know how they could how they were able to top the Hat you know what I mean like I didn't know how if they were able to top the Hat aliy if they were able to top the ante on but they did so there's definitely some elves and magic and Wizardry going on over at this cyclone shop it's pretty crazy it's such a great little RDA it looks great - I have the the beauty ring the in Theon has a bunch of beauty rings and it works with the Citadel which is awesome like it just barely fits it's like perfect I thought well it's a muted flavors for you I thought as well I was a little bit worried about the Ultem chamber reducer on this interfering with the flavor but it doesn't at all I think the problem with Ultem with the Ultem for me is when cuz I can I'll show you so this is the oh Jenny it's an O a D Genesis style tank and I was super excited about this and I'll show you what I mean I notice it the worse with this one so here I have to show you like this so where that cotton is I don't know if you could tell but there is like an ultimate of like separator that can separate the deck from the tank and what happens is it sort of just sits there and I think when the juice sort of sits on it it sorts it's sort of like take some of that flavor from the ol toe and I noticed that the worse with this one and there's also another sort of tank system that I have that utilizes old tum and any it has an Ultima stank at any time I used it I could it just muted the flavor so when I saw that it this was like the old this was like an old how the [ __ ] that is when I saw that this was like an old tub chamber deserves a little bit worried and I think this is the reason why I don't like the wasp because the old Tim top cap as just everything is ultimen this thing maybe there's like different grades of Ultem I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure but I don't notice any sort of flavor from this at all maybe because it's just kind of covering the top right it just reduces it but you'd think that the I don't know I don't know I don't notice it much on here I don't notice it at all on here at all where the wasp they're like I don't think this is a good flavor RDA at all and a lot of people were like hey man check out the wasps you're gonna love it it's a nice cheap good flavor RDA I think it's super muted and I don't like the flavor that I get from it and I have to close it down so it's like this to get any sort of comparable flavor out of it like I really got to close the wasp bound to get any sort of like good comparable flavor from it it's not terrible it's better than some of the cloud chasing RDAs but when you compare it to a Hadley or an ante on it's just not even close and then with the Citadel pretty much anyone that has used it thus far I'm sure will say the same like this is just their best flavor RDA yet it's so good I'm vaping some of the last of this [ __ ] oh my gosh this is not good don't ever buy this stuff not bad but it's kind of weird it's it's just a weird flavor I don't know yeah they said it all though good [ __ ] what kind of bill do you like in yours I have an alien coil in here just a single alien coil Mac uses he says he uses just a regular clapton in his but I have a nice little cool little alien build in here to show you it's at a point to eight so about a point 370 watts and I'm telling you the flavor is moi not just a flavor though the vape from adjust is it's so good it's like a little warmer a little stickier lingers a little bit longer the citadel might be the first RDA I've paid over $40.00 for if you think it's worth it I think it's worth it for sure if you want good flavor but I know some people that don't like the Hat elite they don't like with the flavor they get off the hata ly so it's definitely a subjective thing you know thanks so much for all you do you helped tremendously how do you dispose of old bad nick properly I don't really know I don't think you're supposed to just pour down the drain though right let's let's let's google it how do you dispose of nicotine liquid you probably have to go something like you probably have to go somewhere I'm assuming I don't really know this is what nude nicotine says over on reddit the correct way I'll show you you where is it the correct way pour onto wood chips and put it in the biohazard hazmat waste container at your nearest waste pickup center usually a three dollar fee for drop-off by us but well worth the peace of mind and helping protecting the environment we're talking about 20 to 100 liters of pure here though for a real small amount of 100 milligram military base flush it with water down the sink for a good three to five minutes don't quote me on this EPA would have my head as a business owner for quoting me on this so you pretty much just pour it down the drain pour it down the drain and flush it it's probably because it's just such a small amount it probably just gets filtered out but if yeah if you have like a pure concentrate it looks like you're gonna have to go to some waste center and have them dispose of it pour onto woodchips that's interesting what do they burn it I guess it's easier for them to burn you what coil and why did you prefer in that RDA alien coil 70 watts hey man I bought the Trinity glass for the wasp and it makes it so much better I heard the same thing I need to try to pick one up I heard the same thing I think a lot of Ultem from cheaper Chinese products is just actually colored PE T or P om yeah I don't know I noticed it pretty heavily on the wasp and like I said I noticed it a lot on that oh Jenny and especially when the one that sits in an ultimate ink I notice it it just mutes the flavor and it has a weird thing but with the wasp is just completely muted it's not bad but it's not it's not like saturated you know does it leak I actually haven't had the Citadel leak on me but once yet what I do notice though I will say this there's one downside to the actual performance of it sometimes when I over drip on it it doesn't leak but when I go to drag from the top the juice will kind of just like slurp into my mouth and that's only when I like kind of drip too much or I'd alright drip and then I think I didn't drip and then I drip again so it's happened a few times the only thing that's not very good but it's probably just a product of how close that coil is to your mouth so I'd much rather the flavor than deal and deal with that than anything else you know it's not that big of an issue for me how is the synodos airflow compared to the headily it's a little bit more restricted when you have the chamber reducer on when the chamber reducers off it's exactly the same and I don't know if you noticed it but I also pinched my I don't go fully wide-open on it all the time I kind of pinch it down just a little bit I think it just adds a extra little boost you know I'm soon looking to get my candy mix some more chew how do you bring a chewy note to a mix would you take a quick look at my recipe vape days on orange lime candy please well all right we can take a look at it if I can't find it as soon as I search it but I'm not gonna look at it but if it pops up first and I'll look at it for ya there it is all right let's take a look you got dragonfruit 1% TPA or kept Italian lemon Sicily jelly candy what I would do you got a lot going on for sure you could probably start to consolidate some of these some of these probably aren't necessarily needed but you could also just add I would maybe drop the dragon fruit to 1/2 a percent and then add 1/2 a percent of vanilla swirl and that'll add just a little bit of shooing this and may be instead of cap Italian lemon sicily maybe use Capella's lemon lime to me that has sort of more of a candy flavor to it I use cap lemon lime and a lot of my candies it's like my secret and secret weapon with candies so you can try that out I should help you wait and I know you don't like the Oh addy but I love my Oh a DX is the end this new cyclone Maud yeah the Citadel I've been considering getting the Nixon heart s RDA it looks like looks great as much as you four as well everything got my hands on some cornbread pudding the flavor is okay but kills a kind and a coil so quickly in my opinion it's not worth it talking about um that juice from we talked about that juice country clouds cornbread pudding it does wreck your coil brochure there's a lot of there's a lot of sweetener in it that's why it's so [ __ ] sweet but man I haven't actually had that in a while I should go back and pick some up it is it is getting to that cornbread time guys Falls here I had to put my sweater on today it was chilly I love it let's let the fish get nick buzz hey when try the vicious and a radius the vicious ant radius well I like it what is it it looks pretty interesting the radius V to the problem efficacy and stuff is that oh I don't know where to get it I guess the website huh this looks interesting there's only one image of it I'm gonna have to look at reviews of it what's your opinion on liquid barn lava cake constructs delicious one of the better chocolate bakeries out there for sure what's the best party a for flavoring on a budget honestly you probably get like a had a leak loan and I know Mac probably hates when I say that but I don't think he makes the hata lis anymore if you can't afford the Citadel maybe try to go for like I had a leak loan or some sword I mean the wasp if if the ultimen bother you you could try the wasp mouse is super cheap anything that looks like a Hadley would pretty much be good a good RDA on flavor like just side you could probably get a plume ville a plume veil or a plume veil clone or like one of those older tugboat style RDAs those are really good on flavor I don't know where my plume veil is but I should rebuild it because that it is really good on flavors the the best flavor RDA until I mean that was what 2014 look for a plume veil version 1.5 or something version 21.5 one of those I promise you you can find a plume built for like in a bargain bin somewhere for super cheap you know what I mean and you're gonna get awesome [ __ ] flavor from it and it's super customizable it has side air flow it has top air flow it's awesome don't use the top air flow close the top air flow down use a side air flow any advice on granola base sorry if this has been mentioned in a video before I'm getting into granolas I'm not sure where to start I like to use like a fake cookie and acetyl pyridine the problem with granola is that I haven't felt like I haven't found like a really good use for granola yet so I had it kind of depends on the recipe like if I'm gonna do a strawberry parfait then I might use TFA cheesecake with graham crust a little epic cookie a touch of AP and that will give you a nice little granola but a kinda like that wouldn't really work in like other situations it's a little bit recipe specific what video editing software do you use I use a final cut and Premiere Pro and After Effects I use all of them pretty much but Final Cut is the one I use mostly it's so fast that's why what's the matter if it's an ick salt and normal liquid Nick is there any reason to not use the Nick salts in a recipe and that's really personal preference there's the only difference is that you can use Nick salts at a higher Nick and and it won't feel like a higher Nick it'll feel a little bit lower let's order some flavors real quick I need to make an order I need to pick some more yogurt up let's hope both city has it come on baby come on boss yeah yeah I'm picking up a 30 mil for sure boom add that to the cart yes thank you normally what I do is I'll add in all of the ingredients that I know I need that I've run out of the yogurt is definitely one of them widows oh I do need cheesecake with graham crust I'm also out of that so anyone who needs to make an order on flavorings feel free to copy what I'm doing when I order a 30 mil that means I really use that flavoring a lot you know what I mean if I order just a 15 mil and I don't use it much or I'm going to test it out we could take a look at well we'll start a TFA real quick I don't we won't do all of them we'll just do a few we'll just do a few right I don't really need too much TFA I don't think pretty much have all of this I'm pretty much low on I'm pretty much low on flavor West and that's pretty much it I don't think I need anything here any new ones let's see if there's an if there's like a new list you and see let's sort by newest items Victorine love is new carrot cake well that's new right I don't have that one I don't think I only have to carry it I don't have carrot cake let's add that to the list no out of ten now I don't need much of it let me meringue tart interesting what's this cappuccino that's not new flipper was eggnog I don't have that we could pick some of that up a little bit a little tester actually might have it I don't know though uh wonderfully pers carrot cake I have that pineapple candy you yang Mayberry yang may wonder flavors coming through let's try their pumpkin candy I don't know if I have any of these yang Mei huh snake fruits interesting oh you guys want to know a little secret I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you this but I heard through the grapevine okay I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you this but you guys know me I get rumors I can't keep them I can't keep them to myself so don't tell anyone all right don't tell anyone I don't know if I'm supposed to even say this what cappella is releasing you know how they have super sweet and how it's basically the industry-standard sweetener they're gonna be releasing super sour and I'm getting some I'm getting someone the low real soon so I don't know when it's gonna be released there's no promo materials on it there's nothing that they've never said anything about it but they're releasing a super sour along with a couple other flavors and I should be getting those as well but I'm really interested in that super sour so don't tell anyone keep it on the low I'll let you guys know I'll I'll be the first one to let you know how it is okay if capella hears this just say that you heard it from someone else you didn't hear from me super set come on and from what I hear but again these are rumors this is just around the grapevine but from what I hear is is a game changer it's a game changer they're really excited about it it's a game changer that's all I know they said that's what I heard it's a game changer super sour think about it if they are the ones do it if anyone is to do sour the right way in my opinion it's going to be a tella I've been on a capella train for the last year you big I think there they are my number one now like number one flavor and company I think capella is at the top I do in terms of in terms of the flavorings that they produce the variety that they produce the the care that they take into the flavors plus the way that they treat the vaping industry the way that they listen to feedback the way that they have the v2s they have the reduce flash so it's easier for companies to ship their flavors the way that they produce flavorings you know they listen oh we want this so give us this flavor and they'll produce it good I think capella is now my number one for sure actually for sure they're my number one plate other than my own flavors which are the best my own one shots which are the best and everyone should go buy them right now Easy Express a liquid barn and chefs labors if you're in the UK but other than those capella is at the top of the list shout out to capella if you're looking to sponsor the channel feel free to hit me up we can get that we can just send over the check how much capella I [ __ ] sell come on man come on capella hit me up hit me up actually I do need these as well I don't even have these flavors crunchy frosted cookie tropical we'll add this one on the list we have all these new flavor arts ones what else we got here so some questions talking about a piece talking about a piece sometimes when I use AP it gets really nasty after about two weeks like when you over saturate an image there a percentage you stick to when using ap I usually just use a half a percent I'm usually never really need to go over more than that but I like the way that like when you say when you oversaturated image cuz I know what you mean that's good so nice little comparison there or analogy is that the right word the granola I've been stuck on specifically bunola banana granola from primitive vapor company worth looking into it's solid I'll check it out I'll check it out I haven't really seen many good granola so I mix up mustard milk on all I can taste the strawberry does it need to steep yes you're gonna taste a lot of strawberry though it's not the most balanced of recipes I know I can get it I know I I know I can get it anymore but what's a good combo to sub for anywhere a waffle I don't know maybe TFA waffle I don't really know I don't really know anywhere a waffle is it necessary to use weights for calibration of scales yes all right moving on to a couple more I'm gonna start mixing we don't need that we already have that they got the whole stevia line so I think we're just gonna hit up the flavor West because I need a bunch of flavor West really and I already have all of this stuff unless you guys think oh I did I am missing some hang soon so we can go there what am i out of with hangs I think I'm out of there blueberry which they don't sell here [Music] you oh this is what I need the Australian chocolate here a lot of good things about it add that to the list Australian chocolatey let's see here french vanilla ice cream I'm out of this is see

you those I'm gonna take a half like there vanilla they probably got a good vanilla right all right and now we go to flavor west if you're wondering why I'm doing this because you know how many people ask me what flavor is I should buy on a daily basis it's absurd you do I have flavor west blue raspberry is it worth buying I don't even remember ever using that I have all these buttercream butterscotch Ripple Kenny watermelon but I'm being but a boom the hardest concentrate to get down under yes seriously I hear it's good though you how have you not tried Australian chocolate yet I really did I don't know I just haven't tried it I haven't seen it in many recipes that have needed me to mix it and now does the one I haven't tried I've tried literally every other chocolate on the planet other than that one you you just anything Australian is weird what makes is what what are Australians doing to their chocolate like I understand like Belgian chocolate right they're known for their chocolates but is Australia known for their chocolates don't answer that Pippa think we're actually pretty good on a lot of teeth blue-raspberry sucks friction likes it oh one second oh there we go sorry back back to the lisp to the Lisp back to the list gummy candy yeah I don't need that oh I need this alright I'm gonna ask you guys a question I'm always answering your [ __ ] questions I'm gonna ask you guys a question what is the best regular fruit punch flavoring out there just straight-up red tropical fruit punch what's the who makes the best straight-up tropical fruit punch does anyone is anyone now you I need to know this straight up red Hawaiian fruit punch shams in let's see let's just search fruit punch actually and we're not just going to search it we're gonna go to ECX as well sometimes they say they have different flavors and we're not gonna go here either we're going to go to one one on one one one one flavor one goddamn [ __ ] let's search the fruit punch watermelon pie who meets watermelon pie you you what we got it looks like tropical fruit punch bicolor sucks you there's see there's like nothing there's like nothing how is fruit punching out on the list it seems to be easy what on one's got to have something they always have those kind of flavors get out of here you're chat oh let's go one on one I'm counting on you there we go fruit punch flavored liquid concentrate boom look at this website what are you doing well ad that's a 350 for that for a 10 mil come huh I said I guess I still got to get there graham cracker all right any any other flavors I think we're good on flavors to most six guys start mixing I gotta get we got to get to it I think Hawaiian Punch of eight will give me a heartburn I can actually see what you mean by that I like Beetlejuice it's tropical but not exactly ready I have the Beetlejuice yeah it's not it's not like a red fruit punch and I guess I'm just gonna have to resort to making my own but I wanted something that I can kind of build off of it just doesn't seem like that might be possible there's nothing out there really that really does that you know let's see the natural line ecto cooler yeah I think we're good I think we've got all the flavors we need any other weird ones that I might have to recommend to you guys is this new I mean they can't use that logo I don't know if that's a I don't know if that's a Bull City thing or if that's a flavor worst thing they cannot use that logo well let's see if flavor Wes actually uses that logo I would assume so they have the logo on the logo you you a shower yeah they do use it as their a logo you it's on their website swiss cherry maybe I'll just go on there so you and see what they got click there's a couple more new ones tequila they also sell CBD isolate that's a tit goji berry alright hello Karen get the [ __ ] off my screen hold on one fruit punch but it's not red in my opinion it's a bit funky but not in a good way damn I'm gonna have to make my own man Oh what gives fruit punch that really I don't I can't recall like that red flavor but it's like a strawberry but it's also like what like a lemon like a strawberry infused lemon lime you know I didn't mean like it's an interesting read tart flavor I'm gonna have to make my own that would be a pretty popular recipe maybe I'll make that a layer you guys can have a [ __ ] fruit punch flavor for once Greeks like watermelon pie it has a sesame seed crust and honey did what the [ __ ] is watermelon pie though I no offense to you Greeks but if you're eating watermelon pie that sounds crazy to me is it actual watermelon it is Oh what the [ __ ] is no that looks terrible it looks terrible I don't understood I don't understand it what like what is that that's not pi don't try to tell me that's a PI that is so odd I know like sesame seeds on watermelon probably is because I I know people who put salt on their watermelon and it kind of adds a flavor a little bit I don't do that crazy [ __ ] but I've seen people like this is not okay what is that watermelon is delicious do they bake the watermelon this looks disgusting this literally looks like you know when you like leave watermelon out too much and then it kind of has that sour flavor you know like you leave watermelon in the refrigerator for too long and then you go to eat it and it's [ __ ] gross it's like sour and mushy that's what that reminds me of how do you make how do you make this I'm soaking I'm so concerned flower for cup smashed watermelon seeds removed oh my god this these pop-ups are getting out of control some honey some white sugar some salt ground cinnamon sesame seeds you place the flour in a dry skillet over medium heat cook for a few minutes stirring occasionally until golden set aside to cool preheat the oven to 350 in a large bowl stir together the watermelon flour honey sugar salt and cinnamon grease a 9 to 10 inch pie plate and sprinkle half of the sesame seeds over the bottom pour the watermelon feeling over the seeds the feeling should be about 1 inch too thick sprinkle the remaining seeds over the top bake for 4 to 50 minutes in a preheated oven or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean allow to cool completely before slicing refrigerate leftovers so you're basically baking why would you just put just flour in a pan this is so odd now I'm a little concerned for you Greeks concern for you Greeks have you heard of this I mix 2% yellow cake flavor west and 5% vanilla custard gives me acid reflux see even on a period up to six months steep it's weird yeah don't wait that then if it's given you any sort of ailments not worth vaping all right all right let's get to mix let's get mixing let's get mixing before we do this have to make sure that I do this so we're gonna make something vanilla like I I think vanilla is a really versatile profile you can vape it any sort of during any season any whether but now is always good so we're gonna vape we're gonna do some sort of vanilla I think a vanilla buttercream frosting actually sounds like an interesting thing to make so in terms of like a profile you maybe we will try that vanilla buttercream frosting and I want to use flavor west buttercream I really want to see if that is that secret ingredient and Duchess that has been eluding us so add that as a first ingredient what percentage that's the question River was Razzleberry and island dream what is Island dream what is that what does that consist of like butter creams pretty strong so we'll go 1% I know vanilla is so good when I was so good oh by the way I went to federal donuts if you guys ever come to Philadelphia make sure you stop at federal donuts I don't know if there any if they have hetero Donuts anywhere else but they do make the best [ __ ] doughnut on the planet the glaze just those simple glaze is the best then they have like a cinnamon sugar 1 and then cookies and cream 1 all I recommend all three of those if they have the lavender one get the lavender one they do a pumpkin one they do a maple butter one that I also recommend those are like seasonal one so get those as well but if you if you're just going in there you want to [ __ ] bang and donut plain glazed it's the best and then get yourself a coffee and you're having a good ol time let's get the buttercream I'm thinking we start off with that let's try to keep capella added equation it's so easy to just hit get the custard get the butter you know I mean license let's try to keep the capella out of the equation let's try to stick to other ingredients that we have and try to really do something weird with a vanilla not weird but just something that's not a custard or pudding so we're gonna do a frost I think we go with meringue for like that frosting like feel we'll do a meringue marshmallow thing you know I'm saying I'm gonna use TFA's meringue you we'll do that at one point five and we'll also throw some marshmallow CFA marshmallow at a half a percent I don't want I don't want to probably don't even need it I might have to take that Apple well we'll keep it in there for now babe trains description is accurate an island inspired cocktail with hints of tropical fruits cream rum and coconut yeah well that's not like a fruit punch I'm thinking like just straight-up red sweet sugary fruit punch razzle berry might be a good step though the razzle berry might be a good step I saw some interview I watched some of your interview videos and it looks like you tower over people how tall are you no I mean I'm only six foot I'm 6 foot I'm average I'm an average height I'm not like zesty or Rick Rick is like six I think Rick is 7 3 all of you know I don't even know how much she weighs but he's a gigantic man and then I think Loco I don't know who's bigger him or loco loco is like 73 he used to be pretty big but then he kind of lost a lot of weight he's doing keto so I don't know how much she weighs either but he must be like 300 just like he's a [ __ ] giant as well so I'm not like those guys I'm just six foot six six foot I'm just six foot six foot is not average I don't know six foot seems pretty average to me but there's a lot I see a lot of people taller than me that's for sure in Italy though I was among the taller men in it in Italy which was kind of weird like you can walk down the street and I can see everyone's head and I'm only six foot you you you you you you you you you are you gonna make this recipe public I make all live mixing recipes public every time it's public I'm actually doing this one on eliquid recipes.com so if you follow me you should get an update and y'all reck law on either on ela grass be calm I'm thinking maybe we go with a little maple what do you guys think touch a maple in there with the vanilla let's try it like I'm thinking like a 0.25 look I don't know I don't want much of it in there just a touch I think that should kind of add to the oddness the oddness of flavor what if we added some pumpkin pie by hangsen I did a little survey who thinks the best pumpkin flavor is overwhelmingly its hanging since pumpkin pie cuz it's not a pumpkin spice it's like a mushy pumpkin flavor I was thinking maybe it'll add like an interesting accent to it but now I will leave that out what about hazelnut some hazelnut in the vanilla it always seems to work well the problem is I have the meringue in there if I add the hazelnut it's gonna taste like cereal milk and I don't want it tastes like cereal milk but maybe with the buttercream and that with me the Benigno the buttercream and the maple maybe it won't so maybe we'll try that out maybe we'll do flavor west french vanilla you you you you 2% maybe so we got meringue maple bar buttercream french vanilla marshmallow I'm thinking maybe a butterscotch you you Thank You Carl Carl just saved me from getting wrapped up do I go flavor art butterscotch or do I go butterscotch rips go butterscotch ripple on this one why not this is turning into an interest an interesting flavor here well we did 2% on that as well we might have to turn the buttercreamed down or not Schweich I wanna see what it does and then I'm gonna add some super sweet at 2/5 is 0.25 I don't want too much the vanilla you don't need much of it all right this is what I got so far is it gonna taste like vanilla buttercream frosting doesn't look like it that might be a bad name it's not not exactly what I was thinking about when I was putting these flavorings together you you all right you why do I have so much buttercream this is um this is an unnecessary size of buttercream the smell good you you by the way I was making a strawberry cream the other day for myself and I was using Capella's sweet strawberry and capella super-sweet in it and I ended up pouring 6% of super-sweet into my recipe and I didn't notice it and I vape that nine moves [ __ ] threw up so make sure you're reading your labels carefully you you you you you you you you you you you you interesting smell is interesting you you all right what's the difference between holy vanilla and shisha vanilla there's a big pretty big difference to me shishun vanilla is uh I would say more of like a vanilla spice then like a vanilla cream or vanilla extract me it's like a vanilla spice almost like more of like a vanilla Madagascar vanilla but there's even more of like a floral note to it that I get from it it's pretty good though and holy vanilla to me it's pretty similar to vanilla custard but it's maybe thinners not much eggy properties to it it seems to work better with like um like a bakery sense or like it with with heavier flavors they're just two different vanillas it's kind of hard to explain it in words smells like the Duchess you hear that Carl just for you Carl Carl's been asking for the Duchess for the last three years now let's do it little drip holy [ __ ] it's better than the Duchess holy Cavis is so good this is really good you Carl mix this up right now Carl you're welcome here's your Duchess this is better than delicious it's not as rich or it's not as it's not as what's the word that I'm looking for not rich I don't know I think it's almost a little too sweet I might have to nix the supersuit put something else in there this is really good is it a vanilla buttercream frosting no this is more of like a maple vanilla this is like a maple vanilla this is like a maple vanilla that's why I'm gonna rename it right now before I forget let's rename it maple vanilla now this is also a public recipe it is now up on ELR I will also be up on all the flavors as well I have to carry it over there what's cool about you know r2 is that I'll show you in a minute as soon as it this is a problem we all are that I've been having recently after I click Save recipe it just freezes does this happen to anyone else it just freezes I don't know if it's saved or not every single time though it has been saved but it just it just stays on this screen forever I don't know what's going on it's been every single time so what I'll do is I'll click out of it what you can't I just have to close the window completely and then just hope to god it's saved yeah to public I hope so I can't really show you because I have some stuff on here that I then only I should be able that only I should see but essentially I could I can put it in my live mixing folder so all the live mixing recipes for ELR they go in this folder but you can't see the folders though which is unfortunate I think that would be cool too if Lars could implement that and then all the flavours just needs to implement folders completely is there's no folders on all the flavors at all I will love that Scott come on let's get the let's get the folders going or some sort of categorical organization if you want buttercream frosting just babe babe trains vanilla buttercream frosting done don't have that anything I do some of the day trading stuff I have who does smoke pretty good does smell like buttercream frosting hmm yeah that's a lot more like buttercream frosting that's a lot more like buttercream frosting this is not American prize is a maple vanilla it's really sweet so if you are someone vaping in a citadel a heavily and empty on maybe drop the sweetness off completely like no super sweet at all I probably won't need it I think the sweetness is coming from the buttercream I'm not exactly sure but other than that or maybe it's coming from the maple butter that might be where this sweetness is coming from but the flavors itself it tastes like like a vanilla almost like a vanilla sponge cake like kind of like soaked lightly with maple syrup that's kind of what it tastes like and if you are a fan of the Duchess mix this up you won't be disappointed I promise you and this is definitely the key to the Duchess this is it butter cream flavor wise butter cream it's in Duchess a hundred percent I will go to the grave with that oh no it's spilling everywhere that's what's leaking [ __ ] you how is the lingering room odor with the maple I don't know I can't really smell it I can't really smell it I can't smell the room I'm gonna have to walk out and walk back in I'll let you know I'm happy with this recipe I don't think we need any tweaks I don't think we need any tweaks I'm surprised you're getting that much maple out of the maple bar that low well with the buttercream in there and the butterscotch I think that's what's all leading to that maple flavor it's not just the maple bar the maple bar just seems to be sweetening it it really doesn't seem to be introducing much flavor it's kind of adding more of a darker deeper richer maple flavor to it but just lightly I really want you guys to mix it up I think this is pretty [ __ ] good how does flavor West buttercream compared to Cabela's it's completely different it's more of like a it's more of like a maple cream than a buttercream like it's got like a maple syrup and note to it it's a sweeter flavor but we're cappellas is more of just like more of just like a plain buttercream and then the french vanilla they're pretty similar I would say the flavor west french vanilla is a bit more flavorful it shouldn't say flavorful it's a bit more lighter on that spice note we're cappellas french vanilla it's got like a prominent spice note to it you know especially their version too which I normally use theirs also seems to be no like off notes with flavor west where capella is I sometimes get like that plastic off note that comes with with their french vanilla and their custard sometimes it seems a little bit brighter as well it's just a brighter french vanilla it's more akin to French vanilla you would find in like a coffee creamer that's kind of what flavor west french vanilla reminds me up it's like french vanilla coffee creamer where it's sweet it's lighter it's it's more it just has that flavor to it if you taste it on the back of your hand you'll notice what I'm talking about is it a shake and vape or steeper I mean I'm shaking in vaping man and it's pretty damn good after sleep it'll probably be a little bit richer that's for sure this is really good tastes like Dutchess but with a little bit more of vanilla know what I call this recipe 100% finished no I think I can make it a little bit better and it reminds me a lot of like our true tres leches cake so I do want to mess around with that in the future kind of play off of this profile into a real tres leches cake with texture with like a nice body to it I'm happy with it okay we're done mixing I was easy fun good times good times everyone good times okay any last questions any questions comments anything anything in the news that we should be talking about anything that's a newsworthy any new vape drama any vape drama going on it's my favorite UFC 229 aftermath your thoughts well we I don't know if you guys know this but John Jones and hold the mirror are fighting so that's been confirmed same with Derrick Lewis and DC which is dumb DC is gonna destroy Derrick Lewis since I'm gonna be close it's not gonna be close mark my words if you're betting put all of your money on DC if Derrick Lewis does somehow win like he did last night or not last night but you have C to a 29 then I will eat my words but that was just a lucky throw dude honestly it wasn't him fighting well and it's not his heart it's just that the other guy got too cocky and he should have just backed away for the last 20 seconds instead of trying to go toe-to-toe with Derek Alou like what do you think that's his own fault it knocked out like that and then we saw Connor get his ass handed to him by khabib it wasn't even close he's not even on the same level as khabib in terms of any grappling any wrestling Conor right now he should have went home after that whole thing and just our training wrestling if he ever expects to beat khabib just the promise is that when he shoots on you and he tries to take you down as soon as he grabs your leg one of your legs you're going down he's gonna sit on top of you and he's gonna elbow your face into the mat so you cannot let you cannot let him get you like that ever and it's so hard to do that because he's so good at it so he got his ass whooped it wasn't close at all Lawson or 1 0 rounds could be won every single round but then the aftermath happened so it could be jumps out of the ring and charges after his trainer and his boys kind of jumped Conor but now I understand like the whole kind of degradation of the sport which I I agree that does bring the sport down but that happened when Connor was given those free passes as soon as he threw that dolly through the truck he should have been suspended he should that they should have suspended him they should have represented you know I mean he should have gotten some type of punishment they cannot treat him they cannot treat him above anyone else and I understand he's a superstar he's the moneymaker but this is what happens you end up degra degrading your sport further and further so then khabib you know it's this is not a game to him this is his life is his his honor his honor right it's not it's not fun and games for him it's just a different mindset so he takes everything super personal and you know I'm not justifying him jumping out of the ring and doing all that stuff but to say it is to say anything about how anyone deserved anything or to say that he should be kicked out it's just it's just a mess and honestly it's all Dana's fault it's Dana White's fault you either have to put us out to that [ __ ] immediately or your sport becomes the WWE and it becomes a [ __ ] crazy circus which I don't mind I think it's fun I thought it was awesome that it ended that way I mean it couldn't have been a better ending ending that fight with khabib starting a riot is just awesome that was so great it was so entertaining I don't really care for the honor of the UFC cuz I'm not a UFC fighter I'm not a guy who makes money off of the UFC so it doesn't matter to me a lot of the consumers feel the same way it's just entertaining we like to see that stuff but if you don't want your sports would be like then it well then you have to bank Aviva and you have to bank honor for the dolly incident you know what I mean now the shit-talking is one thing let them [ __ ] talker you should talk all they want talk about his father talk about his his religion talk about his family and stuff like that but it was the DA the specific dolly incident where he [ __ ] he had to put he put Michael chesa into surgery he had to get surgery for that you know Rose was a champion and she had to deal with that before a fight it's crazy it's crazy he should have been suspended and now you have John Jones coming back which is the whole thing in itself and you can argue that he was degrading the support as well so we've kind of entered this new realm of like WWE UFC crossover which I like I did I do like it I like the whole theatrics of it I like the drama it's like WWE except they're actually fighting you know what I mean and I think that's really cool it's just up to the administration and it's up to the fighters if they want to fight in something like that personally UFC should go that route even harder and then have Bellator as like the Honorable you know UFC sort of MMA sort of a leak you know where you go in there and it's all you know suits and ties and you go and you do business and everyone has a happy happy time or shakes hands at the end let Bellator be that and UFC be the crazy WWE moneymaker that it is because there's no turning back you can't turn back now you know you can't turn back now if you do all your views are gonna be going down they're gonna get a taste of that money all the talk all the promotion there's no going back from that so I don't know that was my that was my input on it I loved it I loved it I'm a huge Conner fan I'm a huge Conner fan I think he is sooo so entertaining to watch and he's just a fun fighter to watch like he stands up and he brawls with you he has that old Irish you know he stands sideways and he has that old Irish sorta yeah let me get him Moss let me get him and I love that fighting style where it could be a little bit more boring but I mean he's just ruthless so he was he was when he was had him in the rear naked choke it looked like he was gonna rip his [ __ ] head off like it was hard in there I'm surprised to even let go and as soon as he let go he jumps up over the [ __ ] that was just crazy it was awesome I'm excited for DC DC black beast but I mean I think DC is just gonna destroy him easily and then I am excited to see John Jones come back in the ring after so long I think John Jones is gonna come back and he's going to dominate the whole weight class again I really do I think he's that good I think he's that good so yeah they should go back to Gracie jiu-jitsu well the problem with that is it seems like that sort of fighting doesn't work anymore it doesn't work when you're going against guys like khabib who are just so much stronger you know those Gracie jiu-jitsu guys a lot of them are really flexible like I guess Tony Ferguson would be the best sort of it's not really Gracie jiu-jitsu he's tenth planet but he does have like that jujitsu ground level and he's strong as well as you saw in that Pettis fight I thought that was the best fight of the night him verse Pettis was awesome but when you have someone that is so physically strong like DC and like khabib that sort of American wrestling style ground-and-pound style just seems to be the most effective right now and then you if you're a jujitsu guy and you're going in someone that's just that much physically stronger than you it's a lot harder to kind of put them in those bonds and put them in those holds but it is sort of still it's still an effective martial art against you know stand-up guys and guys who don't train that they don't know what to do they don't know how to counter things because once you start wrapping them up there their instinct is to kind of get out of it but that leads them into an even tighter hold you know and then you're setting them Jiu Jitsu is fun to watch when you know what to look for and then I just think American wrestling right now that American wrestling ground-and-pound with DC and khabib that's just the most effective way to win and it seems to as you know the cards show it seems to be that's what it is and what other news has happened recently I think that's it Kol duty came out I've been playing Call of Duty all day today I'm probably gonna go home play some more oh and then Kanye hey meaning with Trump now you talk a little bit I know a lot of you guys are our Trump supporters and you're getting triggered already by me even just mentioning the the name Trump but when I was I watched that Kanye meeting Trump thing and I just couldn't help but feel like Kanye is just SiC like he's mental like he really has something wrong with in his brain he was just incoherent like I I didn't understand what he was trying to get at with Trump it just felt like words were coming to his brain and he had to say them immediately like the whole like dude the eye plane five like look we gotta get you the we got to get you the best plane you know check out this the eye plane one and a jump is like oh cool I guess we're gonna get rid of Air Force it just was making no sense it was incoherent I didn't understand what he was saying and then you had all these reporters around him and you're just watching like this mentally disturbed guy try to speak to a president who is just very he's just an attention [ __ ] you know you love him or hate him Trump is at attention [ __ ] so you just it's just this really weird sort of visual with the President of the United States like we've never really seen anything like that you know if like I wouldn't mind if it was Kanye but he was like coherent and like making sense and making actual points but he wasn't he was just rambling he was just like very erratic and he was standing up and sitting down and supposedly after he left he went to an Apple store in DC jumped up on the table at the Apple Store and started telling everyone about China and then supposedly when he was leaving he said he was going to Africa like this is a sick man you know and I preached a lot about mental mental health awareness this guy is mentally disturbed that he needs someone to really evaluate his mental health cuz it doesn't seem like all his marbles are there not him being woke I can guarantee you that he's just he's just an incoherent at times are just crazy it's craziness we're having a crazy a crazy time crazy time so I don't I'm kind of over politics it's just the politics in this country are just they just don't make any sense there's nothing to do with policy anymore which is which is kind of sad like the whole Cavanaugh thing and I watched grim green talk about Cavanaugh and to me the whole cabin all thing is just like none of it had anything to do with policy it was all fear mongering it was all just this disgusting display of character assassinations and talking about his yearbook and like you know what I mean like this guy's gonna be in a Supreme Court justice and instead of talking about his policy and trying to really understand the policy in the way that he thinks they're talking about his high school yearbook and he's trying to defend himself and I felt bad for both parties both forward and Kavanagh because I'm just like what what have we become this should been up this should be a private conversation between the bem to and it should be a private conversation maybe between their lawyers as well whatever that is but when you're sitting in front of Congress and you're singing in front of the the the whole Commission you know everyone there plus reporters and you have all the media there and you're talking about is yearbook what what time is this what what what timeline have we entered it was insane to see that it was really a spectacle but we'll never see anything like it again you can guarantee I can guarantee you this type of politics you'll never see again it's just it's just craziness you'll never see it again so enjoy it while it lasts cause it's not gonna be fun anymore it's gonna be all because remember before politics politics before it was today it was very boring and it was very depressing and that's how politics are gonna be in the future so this time where it's exciting and it might be scary it might be scary but there are there is an excitement there and there is a level of just action that we've never seen before and once Trump's gone and once this administration's gone I guarantee you is gonna go back to boring depressing just hateful sort of politics or everything's very secretive and things dark and you don't know [ __ ] you know we're gonna enter that time right after this admission so enjoy this administration while I see you love them or hate them enjoy a while less cuz it's not gonna last you know I'm saying anyways let's get out of here it's getting late my desktop just turned it's telling me his night time I will see you guys Monday make sure you head over to ecig

going [Music] [Applause] [Music] look away [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh hey [Music] is [Music] and i and i might be with a white but i ain't gonna wife it i know that love ain't priceless i've been on a mission since i was 17 to get this green live my dream but they all trying to play i've been chasing cheese dropping songs every week working trying to [Music] [Music] [Applause] so i just got back from the beach the whole reason why i'm like this and the wet we are going to make a smoothie [Music] so [Music] all right testing time [Music] okay honestly i prefer this over ice cream i'm not even lying it's so fresh it's like powder [Music] the color it's so pretty okay look my life is complete [Music] because it's melting oh my [Music] so nice so refreshing that's the only thing that i don't like these seeds really really well are me this feels super nice after spending the day at the beach because me personally i am never ever hungry when i come back which makes a lot of sense you've been exposed to the sun for so many hours give me time to cool down a little bit and get hungry so this is like the perfect thing to have it's refreshing it's light it's really pretty there's so many [Music] i'm like the only one who [Music] so annoying when i eat the whole fruit by itself like the blackberry the whole blackberry or the whole raspberry it's not annoying but when it's like you're drinking something it's annoying you can feel like every single little seed and increases even how many seeds they have it's crazy even though it's already melting [Music] so today's lunch would be my first big meal and this meal is highly nutritious and satiating the protein and fat from the eggs cheese and pork sausage and fiber from the salad aid in satiety first of all eggs are incredibly nutritious their nutritional profile is amazing and then pork is an excellent source of thiamin selenium vitamin b3 vitamin b6 and phosphorus and then old age cheese is also a great source of fat and protein full of probiotics and high in calcium and vitamin k2 also the salad is full of vitamins and minerals to keep you healthy young and vibrant so that when they ask you you can say just thriving so here's the deal i don't do 100 sugar but i don't do 100 alternative sweetener either so this is what i do i do a bit of sugar and a bit of alternative sweetener the reason being is because if you overdo alternative sweeteners you can get digestive problems but if you mix them it's fine as you're not over doing sugar you are just using a tiny amount and you don't get digest issues either this is my cheesecake recipe which is low in sugars and carbs it's high in protein and fat so it keeps you satiated for a long time besides cream cheese is a great source of vitamin a and k and let's not even start with eggs eggs are one of the most nutritious foods on the planet this cheesecake is more of a basque cheesecake so it's not as crazy sweet and it doesn't have the cookie part or the marmalade like the american or new york cheesecake type [Music] i used a bit of this organic ice cream to give it some flavor and natural sweetness it's just organic milk cream and organic caramel by using just a bit it gives so much flavor and then i added monk fruit which is my alternative sweetener you can use a stevia erythetrol stylus tool then i added a bit of coconut flour which is naturally sweet it adds a bit more sweetness and it's slowing carbs so it's a very healthy alternative to flour it does the job well and fast it's a little tricky so if you don't want to have it undercooked or burnt you have to check it once in a while so this would be the perfect cheesecake i am making a mess and making it look super ugly but just for the sake of showing you guys this is how it should look like like a cloud a little little burnt just a little or well i wouldn't say burnt if you want burnt it's fine but you know a little like toasted do you want to call it toasted crispy i don't know but it should look kind of like this [Music] seems like they [Music] [Music] these days it ain't hard to tell who i'm tight with me myself and i and i might be with a white but i ain't gonna wife it i know that love ain't priceless i've been on a mission since i was 17 to get this green live my dream but they all trying to play i've been chasing cheese dropping songs every week working trying to get my buzz up now they're all on my way pull seems like they never [Music] [Music] [Music] yes the feeling after finishing though dead but good so this time it's a little different than usual because i would have a much bigger meal but because i was going out for dinner i had to make room for dinner even though this snack has a fair good amount of fat i don't do bread often only when i want peanut butter or something similar to spread on if you're going to do bread i recommend you to do organic bread the problem with conventional bread is they bleach the flour with toxic bleaching agents aside from the pesticides chemicals and whatnot i recommend to do a whole wheat ancient or sprouted grain fruits as they offer more nutritional value this one is a sprouted bread spread means whole grains are soaked in water until they begin to sprout and enzymes and nutrients are released so it's easier to digest and absorb the nutrients nonetheless grains in general do not have a high nutritional value profile bread is more of a taste but thing than expecting to get a wide range of nutrients from it and as you can see this bread is sprouted whole wheat grains so it doesn't have as much sugar and carbohydrates as regular bread and it also has more fiber so we don't excessively spike insulin or sugar levels this is the peanut butter i'm currently using it's organic and it doesn't have added sugars just organic peanuts and organic palm oil and palm oil if it's organic it's completely fine believe it or not palm oil has a decent amount of vitamin e in the carotene i also had a kefir always do whole milk because it has a better nutritional profile skim milks are depleted of their fat soluble vitamins and then manufacturers fortify skin meals with synthetic vitamins kefir is better than yogurt as it has more probiotics and it's easier to digest for those that are lactose intolerant i didn't want to eat more because i was wanting to go out for dinner we went to a japanese restaurant and i had sushi and sushi can be super nutritious if you only do fish okay the problem comes when people choose sushi that are on rice and a tiny tiny bit of fish if you didn't know sushi has added sugar so if we consider that sushi is extremely high in carbs and has added sugars and that white rice is bleached and depleted of the few nutrients the rice grain originally had sushi rice only spikes insulin and sugar levels it doesn't nourish you at all so keep that in mind", "1W_vAPNhpW4": "today's review is ghost legend v3 max sour pink lemonade so this is max's third uh formula for the special edition legend flavor so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go over the deviances between the two legends and what this formula has to bring to the table compared to the past so let's first start off with max as you can see the formula right there which i'll also put in the comment box below and then here is the previous legend right there or the current legend i should say as v2 is on the way so right out of the get go let's start at the top with the the max blend 3.2 grams of beta alanine compared to 2 grams full clinical dose for recovery and performance and endurance four grams of l-citrulline is carried over between both formulas clinical dose for pumps performance and also delaying lactic acid buildup this has 1.5 grams of nitrous a gene and then also 254 milligrams of vasodrive ap that has been increased from 150 milligrams so these are both gonna be helping with enhancing blood flow and also muscular pumps very important and here we have the l-norvalene and agmatine now both are important as far as muscular pumps go and overall pumps in enhancing blood flow this is just a little bit more top-tier as far as a profile goes because of those two ingredients especially at those dosages which are very very high now let's move to the smart energy blend we have one gram of l-tyrosine one gram of taurine 250 milligrams of natural caffeine uh 100 milligrams of neurofactor 50 milligrams of theobromine and 50 milligrams of olive leaf extract so let's break this down the tyrosine neurofactor theobromine are all cognitive enhancers that's going to help with your mood and focus when you are training the 250 milligrams of natural caffeine is a different form of caffeine found in the regular legend which will provide a steady rise of energy which is a little bit more uh preferred i would say for most users the taurine at one gram is there for pumps and also helping with recovery and endurance last but not least is the olive leaf extract at 50 milligrams enhanced blood flow um it can definitely help improve like insulin sensitivity so that's another key ingredient that you see in the regular legend so overall a little bit more caffeine a lot more pumps a lot more added cognitive enhancers in the max version compared to the og legend so should you buy max how's the flavor what are the differences we're trying to cover all of our bases here so i have two scoops in here mixed up because two scoops is the serving size in this it's basically like a 1.5 kind of mix with the upgraded raw materials and ingredients they suggest two scoops of legend with six to eight ounces of water so i have about ten in here because i prefer to dilute my beverages a little bit more but i've heard this flavor is top tier so i really can't wait to try it so pink lemonade so i'm not usually a huge pink lemonade fan yep but the sour like sour warhead um green apple and the watermelon are absolutely dynamite so if they can nail this flavor which i've heard from others is pretty true to the name i'm really looking forward to it cheers guys oh wow that's like dead on the money so the lemonade wow the lemonade is really really pure i mean you get that little bit of zest in there but that pink lemonade overall flavor is kind of like when you were a kid and drinking like the lemon iced tea like the pink lemonade like that it's literally like this but the sour isn't really taking away from the flavor kind of like the density you get in the the warheads you don't really get that in here where it's like overwhelming and super strong there's a happy medium here with the flavor very refreshing very balanced but overall very very pure if you are a pink lemonade fan you will absolutely love this flavor so overall i like it if i were to nitpick it a little bit i would like the density just increased a little bit but overall from a profile perspective between the two definitely a big upgrade so while this is in stock i would suggest picking it up so you can use the order link in the comment box below and you can use the coupon code chef bob which will save you 20 off the entire ghost lifestyle webpage so any questions on the products or the formula i'll try to include in the write up below but overall very very good formula i really like what's in here especially at the dosages hats off to ghost on yet another fantastic product", "S7uxTGNigso": "[Music] hey this is Lindsay from fit fabulous and today I'm going to show you how to make three super delicious smoothie Bowl recipes so these smoothie bowls are super delicious they are full of like a good healthy protein they're full of good healthy fat as well as good healthy carbs and tons of fiber which is really important when you're trying to eat healthy and when you're trying to lose weight now if you guys are new to my channel my name is Lindsey and this is what YouTube channel it is fitting fabulous and I make videos like this every single Thursday so I make videos on weight loss I do delicious recipes I do fun reviews I do lots of really fun stuff on this channel so be sure to hit this subscribe button as well as notifications so you guys never miss a video like this in the future if you guys already subscribed to my channel I totally want to give you guys a big like virtual hug and just say thank you so much I appreciate every single one of you guys thank you so much and let's get started on our smoothie Bowl so let's get started [Music] the first smoothie we are gonna make is the purple antioxidant smoothie bowl so the first thing we are gonna need for a smoothie bowl is a frozen rice - cauliflower now you guys might think that I'm crazy but I love it putting frozen cauliflower into my smoothie bowl because it totally adds lots of really really a good fiber into it it makes a smoothie not quite as sweet so it's just not like pure sugar and of course it just makes it that much thicker so it makes like the perfect smoothie Bowl so we're gonna be adding one cup of frozen that rice to cauliflower into our smoothie Bowl next we are going to be using a super fruit blend so this has sweet cherries blueberries and a black berries so this is the perfect like antioxidant mixed I'd like to use this blend because it gives you it like that really rich like purple color and it just tastes really good in this movie Bowl so we are gonna be using 1 cup of this super fruit blend [Music] next we're gonna use 1/2 of a frozen banana so I just basically chopped up the banana put it in the freezer and I'm just gonna throw it into my sippy next we're gonna be using proteins so this is lady bus lanes this vanilla cake flavored protein I love using this protein it is grass-fed whey it is gluten free and it honestly it tastes delicious it's only hundred calories and it's got all kinds of like vitamins and minerals and it's just really really good for you so that's why I like to use lady bus Queen for most of my recipes so we're just gonna be using one scoop of Lady bustling for this recipe next we are gonna be using some unsweetened vanilla almond milk and now you can basically use any sort of milk that you use on a regular basis but I do like to prefer to use the almond milk so when you are making a smoothie bowl you just want to make sure they don't use too much liquid or else it's gonna be too liquidy so in this recipe I only use 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk and then you want to put the lid on and you want to put that on the blender [Music] and now for toppings so on this 3d ball we are gonna be adding some raspberries some banana and some time cottage ten parts are really good they have some really really good healthy fat for you so I just like to kind of sprinkle a few like on the top so you can basically design the top your smoothie Bowl however you like it's all about like making it look pretty now this movie has 298 calories picking out the toppings it has a whopping 22 grams of protein it has free 7 grams of carbs 10 grams of fiber which is amazing and it has 4 grams of fat so this is like a really really good smoothie Bowl next we are gonna be making our green superfood smoothie Bowl so of course you're gonna need your blender the first thing we need is our rice cauliflower again we're going to be using 1 cup of the rice - cauliflower in there we're gonna be using an avocado so I just have a ripe avocado here as you can see I kind of squished it a little bit so you just want it less barely kind of squishy you don't want an avocado that's really hard or really squishy it just has to happen like a little bit of bounce to it so you just want to cut it in half and then when you open it you just want to have like that nice green color if it's brown you know it's too ripe or if it's really yellow you know it's not ripe enough so we're gonna be using a quarter of an avocado we're gonna be using some frozen strawberries now these are sliced frozen strawberries of useful strawberries before but it just is just a lot harder to blend up in the blender so sliced strawberries always tend to work better so we're gonna be using a cup of the slice of strawberries then we're gonna be using some fresh spinach those are just some baby spinach just you know our green leafy vegetables it's really good for us again vitamins and minerals we're just gonna like jam as as much spinach as we can into our smoothie [Music] next we're gonna be adding some protein so again and we're gonna be using some lady bustling in the vanilla cake flavor so just one scoop of that next we're gonna be using some lady boss greens now if you guys haven't tried this you're totally missing out the lady west drinks is really good it's apple pie flavored as you can see it there it is really really tasty and has a lot of really great things in it so if you guys take a look at that if you have any questions again like you can comment down below if you have any questions about that but it's got an antioxidant superb Lana there's green super Glenn there's immunity super blend it's really good next we're gonna be using 1 cup of the unscreened almond milk again so you want to put the lid on shut it and then blend [Music] our toppings for her green smoothie is strawberries some blueberries and some toasted coconut chips those smoked coconut chips are so good so just want to decorate it however you want up some strawberries blueberries and then some coconut coconut hope that toasted coconut is so good on smoothie bowls so this green smoothie bowl is 294 calories and now again that is without the toppings it has 25 grams of protein it has 34 grams of carbs but it also has 13 grams of fiber which is amazing and 9 grams of fat there you have it there is your green smoothie Bowl last but not least and we're gonna make the peach strawberry smoothie bowl so again we are gonna be adding 1 cup of the frozen rice to cauliflower in there next we're gonna be adding an a half of a frozen banana then we need 1 cup of sliced peaches now again these are frozen we're gonna be adding that one cup of those this makes the smoothie taste so good then we're gonna add one cup of sliced strawberries as well next we're gonna add in about a half a cup of raspberries now I couldn't find any frozen raspberries they were all out so I just use fresh ones for this recipe then we need one scoop of vanilla cake flavored lady bus lean the protein powder of course add some great healthy protein in there next we need to add our unsweetened vanilla almond milk and in this recipe I'm only gonna use about 3/4 of a cup of unsweetened almond milk then you want to put the lid on and blend [Music] now the toppings for this recipe I'm gonna be adding some banana so I'm gonna be adding some strawberries and again some Pro casts so you can definitely add whatever toppings you want to your smoothie Bowl so this recipe is 263 calories without the toppings it has 22 grams of protein 39 grams of carbs 10 grams of fiber and 4 grams of fat and voila look at that beautiful smoothie Bowl it doesn't it look delicious so I hope you guys enjoyed those recipes they were so good they are so delicious and super super yummy so if you guys have any questions at all let me know in the comment section down below and I will totally totally respond to you so I hope you guys have an amazing day and I will talk to her love you [Music] you [Music]", "PrX7s4iGEIw": "hey welcome back to no hype beer reviews unless it's your first time then welcome please consider subscribing if you do hit the notification bell gilly updates really excited for today's video the beer is courtesy of joe from the beer patrol thanks so much joe i really appreciate it and uh it's another martellus from their hydra series uh if you aren't aware you're watching this in the future uh right now i'm currently filming a theme week where each beer i drink has at least three adjuncts in it and this one is definitely no exception pomegranate blueberry and raspberry sour ale they do um the puree style sour so this will have a lot of like pectin and stuff in it um if i forgot to say this it's seven percent abv and i put it refer put it in the freezer some people are like dude you gotta try these in the freezer and it only ended up being the freezer for about 10 minutes so um i don't know how slushy it's really going to get more than normal but let's find out really excited usually these are filled pretty far this one's not quite as or pretty full this one's not quite as full some of the other ones have been sometimes it's funny like when i swallow that glass looks dirty holy crap that's not doing anything to help the glass look less dirty holy cow cleaned it out walked up here to do the review anyway sometimes when i pour it i'm like wait what was in this beer again like pour some of these beers pomegranate blueberry raspberry okay try to find a cleaner looking spot yeah it's it's funny i've been having some beers with blueberries different fruits or different berries in general i should say and i don't know they've been a little uh like lighter thinner kind of a thing this is very much dark berry color like the skin definitely is in the mix kind of a thing because of how like it's it's dark not just like the innards of a blueberry um the pomegranate juice being a little darker potentially two i don't know just it is a little dark it's more purpley than i was saying i thought it'd be a little lighter um not much i mean we're talking like i don't know it's 20 darker than i thought it was going to be or something not like twice as dark or whatever um yeah definitely get i mean it's all pectin on the side you know it's definitely that's a thick looking beer maybe it is from putting the freezer for like 10 minutes you can see aroma yeah it's a good mix of the tartness from the beer probably that these fruits you know all of those can kick out you know tart things it has a berry quality i get some of that bready doughy maltiness as well it's jammy between the what the malt is bringing me with that doughiness and the fruits in this and that jaminess like some peanut butter like really would make this a sandwich beer for sure like a peanut butter jelly sandwich beer but i really like the level of tartness and jaminess in this like i said a lot of these kinds of beer reviews it's not overly complicated it's adjunct forward that's what you're going to get out of this i get the adjuncts i'm happy about that so whatever it's gonna say taste cheers thanks again it joe have a little okay even from being in the freezer for like 10 15 minutes it is a little thicker than they normally are it is a little um brain freezier if i drink this fast i would get a brain freeze which is funny because i'm not someone who really gets brain freeze i don't know i remember the last time i had a brain freeze but like i can get a little a little of that going right now so yeah okay cool i think people were telling me like 20 minutes would be the sweet spot i mean people's freezers are different but based on where this is at i think the next time i would like definitely do 20 minutes and kind of experiment where do you get that most like slush factor yeah i love the fruit sweet to tart ratios man it's funny i i never had these and then i've had a bunch of whether it's well i guess i shouldn't say never had ever had it from mortalis but um you know i had a few of this style from 450 north a while back and uh you know i've kind of gotten an influx because like i'll get more towels sometimes around me so between like stuff i was able to get myself joe sending me froth and mortalis i've had a bunch and it's been cold weather like these are winter months i've been drinking these you know and i just think these beers hot weather at the beach would just be killer you know taking the blender out and making you know a strawberry daiquiri or something you get cans of beers like this i just i think that'd be a really special experience i don't know like i just my mind goes there i can't help it i love the berries in this i think that pomegranate is like this the understated star of this so and maybe it's just because of some of the beers i had this week and i have had berry beers and having anything a pomegranate but i really appreciate that subtle pomegranate taste that's going on in this it's giving it more depth and again this might be perspective just because of what i've had this week specifically but it's giving it more depth which i really appreciate because again like i said when the aroma like a knock at these beers is well a are they even beers but b you know is there complexity is there depth to them are they just the adjuncts you know fighting for dominance with that sour tartness of the depending what adjuncts you're using and then the base beer so the fact that i'm adding any sort of level of nuance or depth uh um you know making a point to to say that i think is very telling of what the pomegranate's doing with the blueberries sorry blueberry was it blueberry raspberry yeah and the blueberries the raspberries and the base beer i continue to love these uh and i know some people are fufuing out and that's fine i get it people have different preferences but i'm loving these i love putting these in the rotation i'll put it that way i don't know if i'd want to drink these every day but on a hot day yes i would so thanks again i really appreciate it man uh so make sure you check out joe the bear patrol he's on a hiatus right now but he is coming back um so make sure you subscribe to him i'm sure if you watch me you already subscribed to him though um and uh check me out on instagram and i tapped it's no hype beer reviews about those places as always please like comment subscribe and most importantly imbibe cheers everyone", "8N-d_bmDlNE": "hey guys it's Christine before we jump into this video I am going to give it a small disclaimer so first of all if you are triggered in any way by the talk of losing weight or calories or food or anything like that perhaps maybe skip this video and I will be happy to see you in the next one I think another topic that I want to address is lately people think that if you want to change something on your body that you hate it or that you don't think you look good and I don't believe that that's true you can absolutely love your body and still want to change something whether that be your hair color if you want straighter whiter teeth fake eyelashes get a tan or lose a couple of pounds to see your muscles underneath or you know I know some people that want to put on a couple of pounds so they look a certain way and I don't think there's anything wrong with any of those decisions so let me say it one more time for the people in the back you can still love your body and still want to change something did also want to say before we jumped into that that I am NOT a dietitian you do not have to eat what I eat you do not have to eat the amount that I eat or do anything that I'm doing I'm not suggesting that you do that it's just showing you what I do give you some ideas if you want them that being said I have been a personal trainer I have a bachelor's degree in health science and my mom is indeed a dietitian so I do have some knowledge about food in general but you'll see this day of eating video is mostly quick and easy meals and I definitely don't eat like this every day I like a lot of variety my food that just happens to be one day so anyway with that being said here we go we are going to start our day of eating with kind of my workouts that I've been doing so on this particular day I had just finished a seven mile run it is one of the longest ones that I've done when I tend to run a lot more like way more than three miles my hamstrings and hip flexors and IT bands get very very tight so I try to spend maybe 20 minutes 15 to 20 minutes just kind of stretching everything out so everything feels better I guess and to prevent any injuries I've noticed this has become more important as I get older I'm definitely not running very fast right now I have definitely had a hard time I've been struggling getting my speed back after the whole long winter and everything like that I'm just trying to do all of my stretches so everything that you see me doing here is injury prevention and helping me feel better and you'll notice that I am extremely inflexible when it comes to my hamstrings I like I can barely keep my legs straight when I raced down and touched the floor my hamstrings are so tight and because I know someone's probably going to ask about my outfit the camo blue shorts were from Walmart a year ago it was only about four or five dollars very cheap the orange Under Armor tank top was from a friend at the gym she gave that to me about four years ago because she didn't want it anymore and I am trying out a new sports bra I'll probably do a sports bar review coming up here pretty soon so wait on that one it's red I like red so that's fun and then of course I did wear my favorite running shoes the Brooks ghost at the moment I'm wearing the purple ones and they are fantastic my runs during the week I do I'm running right now about three days a week outside anywhere between four to eight miles depending on the day and I am doing some sprints trying to get some speed back hopefully as some of the excess weight that I've gained comes off the speed will come back a little bit more and I'll talk about that a touch more later on in the video I'm currently working out six days a week I'm weightlifting four days a week there is some overlap on cardio and weights and I am loving the way it's making me feel right now okay I'm done with my stretching and I am like desperate for a shower right now but I'm pretty hungry so I'm gonna eat my breakfast until I just want something super super fast that will fill me up and I don't have to worry about so I'm gonna do one packet of this oatmeal right here this is the maple and brown sugar steel-cut oats microwave packet 160 calories actually really like these and one serving of a whey protein shake this is chocolate cellucor brand just like molten chocolate um so I can have some protein as well to help me feel full longer so this has like the fiber and the carbs that I need punished after the run and this one's got the protein to make me feel full so I'm gonna scarf these really really fast with the big lots of water and then hop in the shower and I will see you after that here are the oats I put them in a really really big bowl so it is actually a full packet it just looks really small and this bowl there's my protein shake always delicious and of course had to go with my crystal like pure energy strawberry lemonade you pick it up on it today's eating to be very like quick I was in a meeting and it went kind of long and so I'm really really hungry right now so I got out the leftover fajita chicken and veggies from dinner last night put it in this very very large bowl this is probably six ounces of chicken with peppers and onions I added one and a half ounces of cheddar cheese and a big dollop of sour cream so I'm gonna eat this with a big glass of water right there and I'm gonna see how I feel so if I'm hungry after this I will eat something else but if I'm not I won't it smells really good and pretty excited about it I could have put it on a tortilla but I actually really like it just like this I love fajitas yourself it is I'm still a little hungry someone to eat this brownie that one this edge piece because I don't eat dessert every day or even multiple times a day but hey if I have to go through like life without desserts ever that's not a life I want so I will be eating this right now I just finished my lunch some I eat this finish my water and we should be good lunch is over and we are headed to do Haley's driving test today skills test wishes luck if we can get through this we can set the appointment for her to get her license which probably won't be for another week but hey one step at a time guys one step at a time we're here we're waiting for our tester guy to show up or right next to his car I have all of the documentation proof of insurance Haley's permits with better being here you check ok this registration the money so we have all of the things so while I'm sitting here right now what I'm gonna do is tell you guys about as we've dealt with this stressful driving situation it's the perfect time to segue into Ned CBD oil who I have partnered with on today's video and I have worked with them quite a bit in the past if you've seen my previous videos you guys I love this company the owners care so much about you having a quality product about you having a great experience and there's a lot to be said for that when it comes to people running businesses all of their CBD oil is grown and processed right here in the United States in the state of Colorado I've been doing their period blend CBD oil it has some other essential oils and things in it and Dave's been doing the traditional CBD oil and I have mentioned before the body butter and what's the period lotion so like the salve am I saying it right that came with the hormonal blend okay so check this out Dave's knees were achy and he rubbed it on his knees and it totally worked he was like my knees feels so much better I thought that was like a nice probably different application that the owners at Ned probably don't know about if you guys want to refill your stock of CBD oil or try it out for the first time use my link down below to get 15% off and if you've used my link and do a subscription they'll give you 20% off down there in the doobly-doo all the time if you want to check it out and thanks again to Ned for partnering with me today how you feeling quite a bit nervous I'm very warm so the AC in this car doesn't work it did they turn this one over oh that's him he's here we are back from the test and I don't remember the last thing I said to you but she passed and he let her slide on a couple of things I think because she took the test in a stick he was like I'm really really impressed that you would take the test in a stick but I think one of the things was she didn't signal for a turn early enough he was so nice like he wasn't mean at all but it was like I just like to remind you that blah blah blah anyway so she passed and we are moving on to the appointment at the driver's license office which we can't do until next week I couldn't even call make the appointment today because they're closed today because they're moving to a new location so they're moving everything today so I can't call for a couple days and I know this video is supposed to be about like snacks and food and things like that it's also gonna kind of be a vlog I'm gonna talk about right now is why I personally would like to get back down to let's say my like normal weight there's the reasons are threefold number one when you are an athlete who does sport performance running cycling triathlons like that your weight affects how fast you are right now I'm trying to like get back into running shape I'm considering a marathon but right now it's not going very well so imagine trying to run a 5k which is 3 3.1 miles with a 10 pound backpack on is essentially what I'm talking about if you take off the 10 pound backpack you're faster because you have to move less mass right and so I do approach it as a sport performance issue typically during racing season I always cut 5 to 8 pounds anyway just to assist me in my speed and ability to climb my body and bike up hills better my engine doesn't have to work as hard right if you want to relate it to a car analogy so that's one thing number two is always been an athlete a lifelong athlete played sports my whole life I like on me a muscular look it's not necessarily about being like skinny in fact I would prefer to be a little curvier with like and a little heavier with ball muscles then weigh less and just be skinny for my body type I like the look of muscles on me so I have to lift weights and exercise to gain and keep my muscles and then also I do have to lower my overall body fat so you can then see the muscles and then the last reason which is totally a vein issue is that my pants don't fit very well they're a little tight they're harder to button and that's really it like I just don't want to go out and buying a whole new wardrobe that's all there is to it when it comes to like running clothes or you know like when you look at yourself out of the shower or whatever truthfully I don't think there's anything wrong with the way I look I don't think I look bad I just want to look more muscular and have it be easier to run and have my pants better and that's really it Haley and I did run to the store so I'm gonna record that haul separately you'll see that in a different video you'll probably have already seen it actually but I am gonna get a snack based off some of the stuff that I just got so let me record that and then we'll come back and I'll show you my next snack here's my snack it actually looks really sad but I cut up one of the nectarines they're really small it's almost like a snack size so in the future I'll probably eat two and a string cheese it's like man the name of the game today is like quick and easy I am Telling You string cheese nectarine Oh delicious okay we go do it what it's a little tart but okay I'm gonna have more of these after dinner I love nectarines mmm holy smokes I'm telling you I do like don't even need candy when these are around these are better than candy so good okay I'm gonna start making dinner in just a minute but before I do that I want to show you guys my Amazon subscribe and save order that just came today you guys do that I've been doing it for years you can get a really good deal if you get the five items and get the 15% off and then you buy items that have coupons as well it's typically how I get my protein powder so I'll get the protein powder with like 30% off plus the 15% so it's like 45% off well so good okay I actually didn't want very much this time so I got a couple of new flavors I'll have the Crystal Light energy this one I can get at my regular store but these I cannot didn't really save a ton of money it was just new flavors that I haven't had before the cherry splash and the tropical punch so there's three of my items I am trying out this well both of these like isolate protein powders for Dave we're trying to see if maybe the isolate works better for him or whatever so this one's for me because look it's birthday cake flavor can you believe that so I'm gonna have to maybe I'll try this after a bedtime snack or something I will try it out but here are the stats one serving is 110 calories one carb and 25 grams of protein this one we got chocolate peanut butter because I really like the peanut butter flavours approach powder it cuts like the over sweet flavor I feel like so this is 71 servings this is a huge five-pound container and stats are pretty much the same I've got two grams of carbs hundred twenty calories and 25 grams protein in one scoop chocolate peanut butter and birthday cake flavors and then my little crystal lights so who's like all drinks this time woohoo alright here's my dinner sorry about the noise the air fryers going I'm making some okra in the airfryer so I'll probably have that when it's done it's just not done yet everybody else is having these chicken and black bean and rice burritos and I am having the same I'm just not putting it on tortillas I did a really really small little salad with grape tomatoes over here on the side you know what I'm gonna have more Tomatoes I love Tomatoes and I would do a cucumber but I'm feeling lazy so we'll just do that and the okras coming too so I have about a half a half a cup of cooked rice down in there with I would say at least over a cup of this black bean and chicken mixture with this adobo sauce and a little bit of cheese on top and I'm just gonna kind of mix it all up and eat it with boredom so everybody else is having it wrapped up like that and I'm just eating mine in a bowl okay my okra is finished cooking and I think I'm gonna eat I don't know how many this is probably a cup ish really a cup a cup and a half it's a cup and a half of okra and it's really really hot so I can't really touch it I may or may not eat this whole thing I'm not sure if I do no problem and if I don't no problem I'm just gonna eat them until I'm not hungry anymore cuz I'm still gonna hunker okay I'm done I would say I ate half of that so I'm gonna stop there but I still think I'm probably gonna eat something later it's about 6:45 I like eat one more okay it's about 6:40 6:45 and I'll probably have a snack in like an hour or two look I'm really really trying to cut quickly as far as body fat goes I'll stop eating after dinner I just won't eat anything until the next morning and if I feel hungry I'll have a flavored water just cuz it tastes good it feels like I'm putting something in my stomach but because I feel like I didn't really eat a whole lot at the beginning of the day like breakfast felt small to me and lunch was like small and quick I find when I eat less processed foods like I focus more on things I've made myself for clean proteins vegetables that I'm more hungry more often and because the calorie content of all these homemade things are lower than like a burger or whatever your overall daily calorie intake is significantly less I'm just trying to make healthy choices when I do eat so like for the dinner tonight everybody else had theirs on a on a tortilla and I was like well I don't need the extra calories of a tortilla so I'll just have a salad on the side with some fruit afterwards which I'll probably have cuz that nectarine was so good but clearly I have no issues with like carbs or anything I'm eating rice and beans and fruit and stuff so and because I am in a more of an endurance athlete carbs for me are good like you'll often see me with some gummy bears or Swedish fish on a long run because you need the sugar like right now promise the kids that we would watch the second season of stranger things and so I'm going to log into my bed Angell accounts I can edit out all the bad language and if there's any adult content which actually really like they do not sponsor me but that would be cool if they did because I'm a really big fan it's made me feel a lot more okay with showing my kids a lot of different movies that I wouldn't been okay with otherwise so we're gonna go do that it's an hour episode or like 45 minutes we'll have like a snack number 562 you know when you're scrolling on your phone on Facebook well you're not scrolling on your phone you're scrolling on Facebook and they have those like little video snippets so I saw once a day and my brain just exploded oh I was today years old when I found out that you can cut a watermelon with dental floss oh my gosh my world has changed I need to go buy at watermelon tomorrow you try this out Wow like whoa wow my hair looks really weird it was mushed on the couch for a while I need to finish off this day of eating cuz wow it's nine o'clock and the two little boys are in bed what are you doing with that Hayley's gonna eat hey what what Wow Hayley is going to eat an Abel Abel no it's Abel for sure it's Abel for sure I'm like really thirsty so I'm feeling some liquids at the moment so I might even actually get my snack this nectarine sounds so good but I'm so thirsty I think I'm gonna do a crystal light like with a really big cup of water and water it down and just like hydrate cuz I'm feeling you know what I mean like you super thirsty so I'm really just gonna drink something I think I'm not really feeling hungry right now an apple a day keeps the virus away so if you guys want to know about the calories and all of the macronutrient breakdowns from what I had today I'll put that like over here I actually didn't calculate it out at all so I'm gonna have to total it up right now with my phone I use just using my Fitness Pal app and type everything in the most important part is being like really accurate with what you ate I'm not saying that these are the calories that you to eat and I'm not saying these are the calories that I eat every day some days I go way high and some days I'm just not as hungry and I go lower it's all over the place and most of the time honestly I don't track it that much I just try make semi good choices while enjoying life and not feeling hungry I've been kind of being more careful with my food choices like cutting out all the desserts and I may have been John some cookies a few many times a day during the lockdown to make myself feel better and so I've cut that out so I will say just in the last week and a half of like just being more careful I have already dropped like three and a half pounds of the about seven pounds that I had gained before and then I'll get back down to my normal pants and everything will be fine I may go to a couple more pounds below that like I said earlier in the video really about sports performance and running faster more than anything else I'm gonna finish up this video here I think because it's nine o'clock and I want to watch one episode of Supernatural with Haley before I go to sleep so I'm gonna go do that thanks for hanging out with me feel free to ask me any other questions about like checking your food or food choices or you know whatever you want in the comments and I'll hang out and answer those if you'd like to click on the screen if you want to see any other stuff I've done or if you want to sub or and I'm gonna go to bed so goodnight goodbye you turn it off videos over to go to your home don't you want to go to your home", "AJfUzdaSA4M": "all right we're going to go ahead and get started if you're just joining us go ahead and grab a pen and paper really quickly um i've got a section in my presentation where i'm going to ask you to write down a few things for me um and i also want to direct your attention to our chat um so if you click on the chat you should see that there's a link there you can go ahead and click on that link and let it open in another screen but we're gonna ask that you do a review of our presentation at the end we're always looking for more feedback and always looking to make updates to these presentations so any feedback that you have will be extremely helpful um but if you if you're just joining with us i'm amanda turner i am the sports dietitian with children's hospital sports medicine center i'm going to be talking to you today about healthy habits in the off season for improved performance i'm going to be talking for about the first half of the hour and then one of our athletic trainers adrian stewart is going to be talking more on the movement side of things in the off season to keep you healthy and again get you an edge as you get back in season so we're going to jump right in and get started here and this is our our five key areas we're going to be talking about today that i'm going to be discussing uh we're going to go through building healthy habits for sleep our best meal patterns building nutrient density into our diet caffeine should we have it should we not and then hydration how much is enough and sleep is i know this is not a food topic but sleep happens to impact all of the food decisions that we're making and so i think it's really really important for us to talk touch on this especially in off season because i tend to see athletes who either are really dedicated to their sleep and they they do a really great job of keeping consistent sleep patterns or athletes who are really not very great at getting enough sleep in on a regular basis so if you fall on that ladder side we're going to go through some tips to help you improve your sleep so the importance of sleep it helps to improve focus and energy during your sport it's necessary for muscle recovery and it helps to lower the stress hormone cortisol now cortisol is one of those fight or flight hormones we want that to be active when you steal the ball and you're running down the field or you're getting ready to do a pass on the floor that's when we really want to see that cortisol level elevated but when you wake up in the morning we want that to go back down to its normal level and if you're not getting adequate sleep that's not going to happen sleep from a food standpoint the reason i bring sleep up first is that we have research showing that if we're not getting enough sleep um it it impacts our hunger and fullness hormones in a negative way so getting uh less than the amount of sleep that is recommended on a daily basis actually elevates your hunger throughout the day so you feel more hungry and it lessens how satisfied you feel with meals so you feel less full so it kind of puts you in this position of wanting to eat more consistently throughout the day so you may eat more than your body actually needs and i don't know about you but personally when i don't get enough sleep i want things like caffeine and sugar that help me stay awake and feel more awake throughout the day um so it's hard to get a nutrient dense diet if we are not getting adequate amounts of sleep during the day um so i i put this in here because it has been a super strange year for most of us so if your sleep has been off if you've been on your phone more than usual or on a computer more than usual if your schedule's inconsistent and if you're tired all the time those could be signs that you're not getting enough sleep so the quality of our sleep is really going to drive that other behavior that we're we're wanting to improve so what are our goals that we're shooting for so um ideally anyone between the ages of 6 and 12 we went 9 to 12 hours of sleep a night anyone 13 to 18 we want 8 to 10 hours of sleep a night this is really for kind of your average individual so when you're in season you might actually need towards the high end of these numbers or more than you do in the off season just because your body's trying to recover more but some some some tips in order to help you achieve these goals we want to stick to a consistent bedtime schedule so sleep habits largely revolve around our habits so if you have a consistent bedtime at 12 p.m or 1 a.m you probably don't start to feel tired until that time that's because our body builds on the habits that we already have so if you're wanting to change that bedtime to more of a 10 p.m bedtime it's gonna take consistency in you know starting to wind down and getting into bed at 10 you're not going to feel tired the first few nights but the more consistent you are with getting into bed at that time and getting up at that earlier time the more your body will start to adhere to that new schedule we want to make the bedroom quiet dark and at a comfortable temperature so if your your house is warmer or cooler than what you feel comfortable in maybe a small space heater or a fan those could be really helpful things in the bedroom for you no technology devices in the bedroom and i feel pretty strongly about this one so especially cell phones ipads computers those are not things that you should be using while you're in your bed ideally you would put those in a place outside the room before you're going to bed so that you can truly just wind down and not worry about your phone dinging or buzzing and you know keeping you up throughout the night avoid caffeine after 2 p.m we're going to talk about this more but that can impact your sleep and then ideally we would eat dinner about an hour or more before bedtime so i know when you're in season especially if you have late games like competition it can be hard to stick with this hour before bed rule especially if you're not getting home until nine or ten o'clock at night however in the off season when we have a little bit more control over our schedules theoretically um hopefully you can put this practice into place at this time but i want to say too if you're in in season and you're getting out late and you just finished a competition and you're getting ready to go to bed you should still eat something after competition that's an important place to eat you shouldn't go to bed hungry um so we can talk more on that that's kind of another talk but for now in offseason about an hour before bed is when we want to finish dinner so here's what a sample sleep schedule would look like let's say at nine o'clock we're gonna silence our phone and put it in whatever our bedtime location is so maybe that's in um an outlet outside your bedroom so it can charge and still be your alarm but it's not in the bedroom with you um maybe it's going to be maybe everybody put in the family puts their phone in a bucket at night so that nobody's disturbed at night whatever you want that to look like but it shouldn't be in the bedroom with you at nine o'clock you would start completing your bedtime routine wash your face brush your teeth read a book whatever that looks like for you at 9 45 we want to start getting your room ready so close the blinds close the shades make it as dark as possible turn off any electronics maybe if you do i don't know if people still have these but if you have an electronic clock that has a red or blue um numbers on it turning that around or covering it up that can actually have a really um positive impact on your sleep too so you might see if there's anything like that in your room so that gives us plenty of time so by 10 pm we are actually in bed covered up in the sheets have our eyes closed and that prepares us for a 7 a.m wake up time so again if you're in the 16 year old range that gives you that eight hours of sleep or sorry nine hours of sleep that we're looking for okay so this would be an ideal schedule if you are way off from this current schedule you may you may need to take it in um in chunks in order to get there so if you currently go to bed at 1 am and this can be the actual time you're going to bed not the time your parents think you're going to bed too so if it is 1am then getting to bed by midnight then getting to bed by 11 p.m taking those little steps to kind of slowly rewind your bedtime it will help you get there but again we want to get this in place so that once the season starts back up again your body is well rested it knows what it feels like to be well rested and then you're going to be in this pattern so that as you're playing you're already going to have this really nice circadian rhythm that you'll fall into and hopefully recover faster when the season comes so now we've got sleep worked out we're going to go into meal patterns next and this is probably my second biggest pet peeve with my athletes athletes need three meals and a minimum of one snack every day some athletes need closer to three snacks but at least three meals in one snack even when you're not in season that's really important okay so we want to focus on getting in carbohydrate protein and color at every single meal those are like the easiest things to remember when it comes to your your meal components zucchini noodles and cauliflower rice have been really popular lately cauliflower pizza would fall into that cauliflower rice column those count as color not as carbohydrate regular noodles like wheat pasta noodles rice noodles or regular rice those would all count as carbohydrates but these are vegetables they count as color so in our example that we have here we've got our yogurt and chia seeds and then the pumpkin seeds those count as protein we've got our granola which is our carb and then we have our berries i think that's acai in there and then cherry mixture that's our color component so this would be a really good example for maybe a breakfast or maybe a bigger snack if you've been active this is a really good distribution so the reason i'm focusing on meal patterns is that we have researched what different meal patterns can do for your body the first one that was researched is this kind of snacker pattern where this person this athlete would eat like eight times a day this is the person that you see that kind of is always eating something they're getting about 10 grams of protein every single time they snack so in total they're getting 80 grams of protein for the day let's say that that is that's correct for them but they're eating eight different times really small meals so we compared this eating pattern to the blue lines which is our kind of breakfast lunch dinner and a snack pattern this person eats four times a day about every three hours but they get a little bit more protein per meal so they're getting bigger meals that are about 20 grams of protein each compared to those those small meals with only 10 grams of protein total amount of protein for the day is the same though still 80 grams of protein and then the last meal pattern we compared it to was a two meal a day pattern so this person needs two big meals a big lunch and a big dinner um they're still getting 80 grams of protein so 40 grams at each um but after they have dinner they're going a pretty long time until they have lunch again so the purpose of this study was to really look at what type of eating patterns do we get the most muscle recovery strength gains and lean gains or muscle gains out of if you want to guess which one it was i kind of already gave you the answer uh it's eating every three hours so the blue pattern where we have about 20 grams of protein spread out throughout the day um it gives us more opportunity to absorb and incorporate that protein into our muscles our tendons our ligaments our bones so we've seen that just having that threshold of protein that amount throughout the day is really important now let's say you're in season or you're just active and growing or you're really tall and you need more snacks than just one snack that's okay we still want to maintain this core pattern where we've got a decent amount of protein coming in four times a day and then you can add on a couple other snacks that are maybe lower in protein but it's really important to make sure that we maintain that core four times eating a day at minimum um so i wanted to give out these plates so that you could see kind of how your eating pattern should be different from in season versus off season this is a higher activity pattern and i know some of my athletes actually get more active in the off season i see that a lot with my gymnasts but if you're not more active in the off season this is going to be your your in season plan so when we are more active we need more carbohydrates our carbohydrates on this is our grain and our fruit so that piece would cover about half of your plate protein would cover about a quarter of your plate or it's about palm size portion and then your veggies would be about a fist portion size or about a quarter of your plate there so again more food and especially more carbohydrates when we are more active so i want that to kind of be the pattern in your head here now when we're less active so let's say you're off season i'm a runner so when i go into off season i am definitely less active than when i'm training for a race so if your activity goes down our goal in off season if we're not as active is to really maintain our protein intake so i see a lot of athletes who their hunger goes way down when they're not training as much and so they just cut back on a lot of their foods but a lot of their protein foods they cut back on so maybe they stop drinking as much milk or they're not eating as many eggs or they cut back on their meats or cut it out completely those are all things that we still want to maintain that good amount of protein it's really the carbohydrates that will shrink down a little bit so our grains you'll see here only cover a quarter of our plate and then our fruits and veggies will be about half of our plate so fruits and vegetables actually go up when we're in the off season we need more of those things so i think that's where a lot of athletes kind of miss out is we're not getting more of those fruits and veggies in in the off season and that can just kind of skew our proportion of nutrients so i wanted to give you a couple meal schedule examples so this first one is let's say this is a weekend we're getting up a little bit later at 9 30 or 10 so we're gonna have breakfast around that time lunch maybe at one a snack maybe about four and dinner a little bit later around seven this is your really good example for three meals and one snack a day i did want to mention that if you do have a habit of skipping meals so let's say you're not great at eating breakfast or you get busy in the middle of the day so you just miss lunch or miss your snack often plan what you're going to eat at those times so if you need something easy or something that's not very filling because you're not super hungry at breakfast time plan to have a small protein bar or plan to have even a glass of milk can work as a breakfast option um any of those are really good choices and then set a reminder to eat um you know if you tend to be out and about and or playing or you know out in the yard with your friends or whatever that looks like set an alarm to go off at 12 or 1 just to remind you to run in quickly and grab a pb and j sandwich even just to get something in we want to create those meal patterns so that again once we get back into season you already have these standards set up and your body is going to be accustomed to that so then your body's going to tell you hey i'm hungry it's one o'clock this is when we normally eat and you'll already be used to that pattern so it's going to make you a better athlete because you're going to have better fueling patterns long term so here's another example for maybe an earlier riser or maybe a school day for example this has two snacks in it a little earlier dinner time here and so if you were still hungry after that or you had an especially active day we might add a snack at 9 00 pm but i wanted to give you a couple different scenarios to look at what this might look like to hopefully adjust yours so that it's something that you can stick with okay sample meals i'm not going to talk through this in depth you will get a copy of this presentation from my colleague so you can look through these breakfast lunch and dinner options and then i also have some great snack options on here as well so don't stress you're going to get those later on too and if you have trouble getting those i have my email at the end if for some reason you don't get them just reach out to me and i can share those directly so we're moving next into nutrient density so if you haven't heard the term nutrient density before that is the uh amount of nutrients that's found in a particular food um so foods that are nutrient dense have a pretty high level of nutrition they give us lots of vitamins and minerals or a lot of a specific vitamin and mineral so i want you to think in your head what those foods that fall into this category might be give you a second and if you're thinking of things like fruits and vegetables and whole grains and nuts or anything that's listed on this slide all of those would be considered nutrient-dense foods the opposite of these foods would be our low nutrient density foods so they don't contain a lot of nutrients so that would be the opposite of these foods so snack foods chips snack cakes deep fried foods those would all fall into a low nutrient density category it's not that we can't have those foods we just want to focus on getting in these really nutrient dense ones on a regular basis and then we can sprinkle in our favorite foods um here and there based on what what meals we're having so when we're building a nutrient dense plan these are the goals that we have to make sure we're getting good nutrition in the off season and again our whole goal is let's build great habits in the off season so that when we get in season those will stay and we don't have to think as hard about those so we're going to eat protein with each meal i don't care if it's eggs or dairy products or edamame or meat or fish whatever it is that you like we need to have some type of protein source present with each meal choose whole grains half of the time so that includes brown rice whole wheat pasta whole wheat bread um if you have like a black bean pasta that would also count um quinoa would count their amaranth if you get into some of these other grains all of those are really great sources potatoes actually count there as well i like the the baked type better than the deep fried type but there's definitely a place for the deep fried ones on occasion as well fruits and veggies this is one that i really find my athletes often don't get enough of three to five cups a cup's about a fist size of fruits and veggies every single day if that seems like a lot to you and you're like oh boy i'm nowhere near that amount start with even just getting one or two pieces of fruit every single day and set that as your goal the plant components that are found in fruits and vegetables have specifically shown to reduce inflammation or reduce damage to the muscle after activity so it helps us recover faster and potentially with less muscle pain too so if you tend to get really sore at the beginning of the season our hope is that by adding in more fruits and vegetables in off season and then maintaining that as you start training you'll you'll recover faster and you'll be less sore as you're first getting into your sport so that's a really good thing right shooting for three to four servings of dairy daily or some type of dairy alternative where we're getting calcium and vitamin d and then nuts a few times a week and that's our a nutrient that or a food group that i feel like um a lot of athletes overlook often they're super high in magnesium they're really high in healthy fats and fiber so they're a great thing to incorporate in even if that's like a natural peanut butter or almond butter that would work just as well as whole knits so here's the writing it down piece so i want you to write down your five favorite fruits and vegetables on that piece of paper that you have with you so five favorite fruits and veggies if you're like oh gosh i can only think of carrots and apples i made a list for you so that you have a cheat sheet if you don't have five that you can think of at the moment we have some work to do so one of your goals could be that in the off season you're going to work on trying some of these fruits and veggies that are listed on the page so that you can work your way up to five different things that you like now if you only like carrots or bananas or apples and i want you to get three to five cups of these fruits and veggies every day you're gonna get super sick of carrots bananas and apples so i want you to have more variety in the types of foods that you'll choose but we need to try them and we have to be open to trying them at least five times generally before we decide whether we like them or not so if you've never tried jicama hickam is one of my favorite ones it's it's kind of sweet but crunchy at the same time you can put spices on it you can bake it you can eat it raw it's i think it's a really nice veggie to try um or fruit sorry to try actually i think i have it listed under the veggie category but it can go in both directions um if you haven't tried that before try it and see what you think of it it's really funky looking um item at the store it's like a brown color but it's it's one that you should try and just see if you like it so if you haven't tried most of the things on this list i will tell you i'm not familiar with everything that's on this list so get creative at the grocery store try something new see if you can add that into your five favorite fruits and veggies and then share this list with your parents so that they know what things you're excited to eat so that they can buy more of those things too and then you really have no excuse for getting the fruits and veggies in at that point all right our last topic that we're running through today is hydration and caffeine so i lump these two together because they kind of play off of each other we're going to start with the hydration side so from a hydration standpoint water is an essential nutrient we need water for temperature control in our bodies that's really important for athletes because as your core temperature rises with your extended activity if your core temperature goes up too high that starts to reduce how much output you have or how hard you can work during your activity so we want to have plenty of fluid on board so that we can keep that body temperature regulated well water also delivers nutrition to the muscles and to the working tissue which is you know you have to have oxygen coming to the muscles and if we don't have enough iron and enough water in our blood to deliver that you're going to feel more fatigued and then water also helps to remove waste so lactic acid buildup with exercise and other waste products that are a product of exercise that will be removed with water as well i will say most of the athletes that i see are under hydrated maybe not dehydrated but they're not maximally hydrated um so what's going to count as your fluid intake water milk tea and 100 juice those will all count towards your fluid intake we want to limit sodas we want to limit sweetened coffee drinks and sports drinks sports drinks are for sport only so when we've got sports happening for longer than about an hour 15 hour and a half that's when sports drinks are appropriate um it's not an appropriate lunch beverage or dinner beverage really at any time to be honest unless you're again really poorly hydrated and we can fix that problem so those are things that can still count as your fluid intake but we just want to use them in a little bit more moderation and then we want to avoid energy drinks definitely so energy drinks i think i have it here i don't have it on the next side energy drinks are actually classified as a supplement in the u.s they're not classified as a food whereas like sodas or coffee drinks those are classified as a food the problem with energy drinks being classified as a supplement is that it's not regulated here in the u.s so all of our supplements that come in bottles there's no specific mandates on those supplements that says um you know a certain company has to look at it first before they're able to put it on the market to make sure it's safe and effective we don't have anything like that so the problem with energy drinks is that even though on the label it may say oh this is only 150 milligrams of caffeine or oh this has b vitamins in it we don't know if that information on the label is true and has been verified so it's important to make sure that you are i i recommend that all athletes are just avoiding energy drinks because i think that the risk for getting over caffeinated or overdosed on other stimulant type of herbal substances is way too high and it causes heart palpitations high blood pressure um and can take you out of your sport or or worse so i don't recommend doing those ever really if you need a little bit of caffeine we can get it from other other food sources instead so how much water is enough water on a regular basis or how much fluid so on a minimum when you are not active we need half of your body weight in ounces for fluid so in the middle of my chart here if you weigh 140 pounds we would need about 70 ounces of fluid on a day you do not exercise in order to be taking in enough fluid so this is what i mean when i say my athletes are under hydrated is that a lot of athletes i see are meeting these guidelines but they're also exercising on those days when you exercise we're losing anywhere from 10 to an extra 30 ounces per hour of practice um you know so for a high school male athlete who's wearing pads in a football practice on a hot day you're probably going to lose closer to that higher side and need a lot of extra fluid whereas my younger let's say 10 to 12 year old athlete who's playing a shorter soccer game in a cooler weather maybe they're going to only lose on the lower end of that but the biggest thing is to make sure that you're getting at least that minimum in and then adding more fluids for the exercise that you're you're performing on the left hand side here this is a urine color chart if you've seen me talk before i know you've seen this chart before the top three one two three those are hydrated colors of urine anything at four or below that is dehydrated when you wake up in the morning it's really normal for you to be at like a four or maybe a five because you've been fasting all night you've been sleeping so you're probably a little bit under hydrated um but then hopefully after you've had breakfast and drank some in the morning the next time you use the bathroom you're at that three or higher this is the best way to tell you're hydrated to be perfectly honest so if you finish pack practice and your urine is like a six or a seven color you are not drinking enough throughout the day we need to work on getting you more hydrated um if you also can go several hours like four to six hours without using the bathroom during the day you are also under hydrated um ideally we would need to use the bathroom about every two hours and that indicates good hydration so if you're going every 30 minutes or hour we're probably drinking too much at one time or or drinking too much in general and so we can probably pull back on fluids at that time um but if it's about every two hours that's a normal bathroom schedule to have as long as it's in that like pale yellow post-it note color range um so that's something that you can easily pay attention to every time you go to the bathroom so when we're building hydration habits because our whole goal is to make sure that we are improving your fluids again in the off season so that when you get in season your body tells you when you're thirsty and you can listen to it and you've got the means to be able to drink more water i will say as a caveat too with covid it's harder for all of us to get in more water so i think it takes even more dedication especially if you're in school in person or if you've got a job where you're wearing a mask all day i've struggled with it as well so planning to take those short breaks and drinking more water on those breaks where you're away from people and you can take your mask off that's it's a really hard habit to to do but it's really really important to make sure we're working on so get a favorite water bottle maybe one that tracks how much water you drink there's one i know there's an electronic one that will count how many times you've filled it up for the day um so that will help you stay on track with hydration always have fluids with you even if you're just running errands if you're hopping in your house to go visit your friend for 10 minutes but then that turns into two hours and you didn't bring anything with you uh you're gonna be under hydrated by the end of that so just bring your water bottle with you and get in that habit um set an alarm on your phone maybe to remember to drink up especially if you're really bad at drinking enough throughout the day and then set a goal on how much water to drink throughout the day and again as far as goals go use these numbers as your starting goals but if you find that you're drinking this amount and you still can go about four hours without going to the bathroom you probably need more fluid than that so that's when we can start to increase how much fluid you're drinking okay okay caffeine so how do caffeine work with our hydration um caffeine caffeinated beverages can count as part of your fluid for the day so we talked about coffee and tea those can count as part of your hydration mechanisms however there are some things to consider with caffeine caffeine can create dependence so if you're used to having caffeine every single day a lot of us know this myself included you need that caffeine to feel awake right it stimulates your central nervous system and wakes you up in the morning so if you're used to having it it's your body's going to become reliant on that in order to function on a daily basis it will negatively impact your sleep caffeine has what's called a half-life of about six hours so if you have a coffee at 3 pm 6 hours after that nine o'clock uh it's still going to be in your body and can negatively impact your sleep so that's why we say if you are going to have some caffeine don't have it after two o'clock it can improve athletic performance if it's taken in small doses at specific times and you don't have a tolerance to it so i'm more of the persuasion of keep caffeine uh relatively low on a daily basis and then time it so that you can have a little bit before a big competition so that you might feel a little bit of that caffeine um effect where it makes exercise feel a little easier it makes you be able to work a little bit harder during that exercise but also know it can speed up the gi tract too so for specifically sensitive populations it may need may make you need to use the bathroom number two and if you are in that camp you may not want to take it before exercise and then excess consumption as i mentioned earlier can cause heart palpitations elevated blood pressure and irritability which is why we're avoiding these guys over here on the left so what's recommended is 100 milligrams or less per day for teens if you're younger than 13 we really don't recommend having caffeine on any basis but if you are in that teenage years then up to 100 milligrams a day is allowed again using food sources and avoiding supplements that aren't regulated so how much caffeine is in different food products that we have here so i've got a bunch of different things green tea is one of your lowest at about 10 milligrams per six ounce cup the cups that you're getting from starbucks are a lot larger than six ounces so you'd need to multiply that times how many ounces you're getting uh black tea dark chocolate and soda you'll see there are all pretty moderate so about that 50 milligrams of caffeine and same with a starbucks refresher where it goes way up a starbucks coffee is almost 250 milligrams of caffeine that is a lot in that's a tall so if you get a larger than a tall coffee you're getting even more caffeine than that if you brew coffee at home it's usually right around 100 to 120 milligrams you can see your five hour energy zip fizz these type of supplements five hour energy is closer to a starbucks coffee and then your zip fizz is about 100 milligrams there um so again i would recommend staying away from these on a daily basis so that you don't get accustomed to having them and dependent on them and then if your stomach tolerates them okay we would test that out with a practice or two um you could uh try taking about a hundred milligrams of caffeine so maybe uh you know 12 ounces of black tea so a tall black tea from starbucks even that would be acceptable for about an hour before your exercise to give you that little performance boost but we would really only do that during like big competitions we wouldn't even do that on a regular basis for practice because again that creates dependence on these things so i'm hoping this makes sense and i will open it up for questions as we get to the end here so just in summary with habit building i want you to pick the habit that seems easiest out of those five that we just talked about and i want you to work on mastering that over the next two weeks so if you heard what i said about the fruits and veggies and you're like okay i'm really going to dedicate myself to getting fruits and vegetables down before next school year you're for these next two weeks you're really going to focus on getting two pieces of fruit in or two vegetables in every single day once you're good in that habit then we add on another habit this is called habit um stacking we'll add on another habit work on that for two weeks so maybe you're gonna work on getting nuts in a couple times a week and we're gonna work on another habit so maybe we're gonna cut out the caffeine at that point and we're gonna save it so that we can actually see some performance benefits from it on down the road but you don't have to make all of these changes at one time if you pick one and focus on one every two weeks then over the course of 10 to 12 weeks you're going to have all five of those habits in your nutrition and then hopefully we'll be in a really good spot as the season is getting started back up okay so our ultimate goal is again improving these nutrition habits um making them really strong in the off season now so that as practices and games start back up again you've got them in place your body is going to be ready for that nutrition and you're going to recover faster and get stronger at your sport okay that is it for my side of the presentation if you have questions from the presentation the sports nutrition at childrenscolorado.org is where you can reach me if you want to schedule a nutrition consult you need to talk about something that you've been struggling with nutritionally that is the phone number that you can reach me to schedule and again you'll receive all of this information as well i'm going to go ahead and stop sharing my screen here and then turn it over to our athletic trainer adrian who is going to get you on the exercise side and then we'll answer questions at the end as well great thanks amanda so as amanda said i'm adrienne stewart i'm an athletic trainer with children's hospital i'm currently working at mountain range high school so i'm going to talk to you guys today more about the movement component of what we should be doing with our bodies and conditioning in the off season so now we know how to fuel ourselves correctly thank you amanda that was great and stay hydrated to increase our performance so now it's like what types of movements can we be doing to enhance our performance as well so a lot of times people get a little bit confused as to what activity we should be doing in off season we don't actually have to be practicing our sport to improve our body movement mechanics and get better at our sports become better athletes and prevent injuries so staying active during this time is super important um but we're going to touch on some like activation mobility things that you can be doing and these are things that you can do safely and effectively at home you don't have to be under guidance of a coach or anything like that which is great especially um now being at home during school time so uh it's really good to allow yourself some time to rest away mentally from the sport to prevent prevent burnout but also for your body to rest so we are doing a lot of repetitive movements in sports so let's say you're an overhead athlete like a baseball player a volleyball player during this time we want to be working on the muscles that help us be stronger at those movements but we don't need to be throwing a ton of pitches or throwing a ball overhead or doing overhead movements this is a great time to get outside go for a hike with a friend go running try playing soccer if you're an overhead athlete doing something where you're still staying active you're moving your body but you're allowing um the repetiti the repetition of your upper body to relax so what is the off-season program emphasis and what can you be doing at home now so we can be working on our mechanics and movement patterns so we can be building muscle with our own body weight we can be building muscle with resistance bands and just simple things at home so why do we want to do these things so our body movement and mechanics is critical into making us better athletes right so if i'm moving efficiently and effectively i can get become more powerful faster stronger all those things proper programming from a strength coach is great if you have access to that but if you don't you can still be doing these things on your own so we're going to go over some mobility and activation but what is exactly activation um some of you might be wondering so these exercises are movements that you're doing to help prepare your your nervous system for a bigger movement so this could be something like as simple as a glute bridge to activate your glutes to prepare you to then do your movement in sport that more dynamic powerful speed movement so essentially it's helping turn your muscle on and train muscle memory so this is going to help increase your range of motion help improve your form and mechanics so we want to train that muscle memory similar to so it turns on in our activities of daily living so if i'm correctly firing my glutes and hips and core i'm going to get out of my chair more effectively i'm going to run up and down the stairs more effectively and that is training and practicing your muscle memory just like you don't think about getting up in the morning to brush your teeth it's just something that your body is used to doing so we can do the same thing with our muscles in our everyday movements that's transferable into sport so that again is going to make us more mechanically efficient and better at our sport and then again at less risk of injury so a couple of the exercises that i'm going to start with that are simple and safe at home so i will say form is very important we want to make sure that we're activating the correct muscle when doing these instead of further perpetuating poor movements so there's tons of free content that you can look at if you don't watch this presentation over and over again and watch me do it there's a ton of free movements videos on youtube we have some links on our sports medicine page through children's hospital that has handouts of different exercises and so forth if you just need a little bit of reinforcement on those it's also very easy and to get a hold of a resistance band if you don't have equipment at home you don't need you don't need anything fancy you don't need dumbbells i would recommend some mini bands that you can get on amazon or any of your sporting goods stores your athletic trainer will thank you if you purchase one of these on your own and are doing these exercises and you hopefully won't have to see us less because you won't be hurt as often so i'm going to start with hips and glutes these are some easy and again safer ones to do at home give me two seconds and i'm gonna take the background off so you can see the movement that i'm doing so our first one i'm going for hips and glutes i'm gonna start with hip bridges we're to go down on the mat over here so you don't need a map you can do it on the floor you can do on a sweatshirt or a towel whatever it doesn't matter i just recommend that you don't do this on a soft surface you don't want to do this on your bed or anything like that because then you're not getting um you're probably not going to activate as effectively so this one you'll lay flat you're going to have your heels shoulder width apart can you see me i'll spin there we go feet shoulder width apart and you're going to have your arms flat on the ground okay so you want to inhale you're going to push through those heels and drive your pelvis up off the ground with your spine in neutral until you're in a straight line with your body you're going to squeeze those glutes nice and tight like you're squeezing a dollar bill hold for two seconds and then slowly come back down you'll drive back up through those heels neutral pelvis and come back down so each of these movements that i'm going to show you today you would start about 10 to 15 reps if 10 is difficult and you're starting to fatigue then that's when we want to stop you can increase your wraps as things start to get easier and add resistance and so forth the second one i'm going to show you guys is banded monster locks so this is the minivan that i was talking about they come with different resistances wherever you're comfortable maybe get a pack of three start with the easier one so for this one we're going to bring the band up right above the knees and i encourage you to stand up and work through these with me if you want so then it'll help you set up better for questions if you feel something that feels funky or have any uh wants some further clarification so hip hinge is always important for our lower body exercises just like you're sitting back into a chair first so you're gonna hinge at those hips and you're going to move with a lateral step so i'm going to walk towards you just so you see my feet a little bit better so hip hinge heels knees shoulder width apart and you're going to take a step to the right that back foot is going to follow and come forward that's one step then you're going to step to the left right and forward you should feel this around your glute need the side of your leg should be burning a little bit so we're going to do 10 of these forward and then you'll also go backwards i strongly encourage you to stay in this hip hinge position the entire time that you're doing the movement if you're fatiguing pretty quickly you can stand up at the end of movement take a quick break and keep going but again try to increase your resistance in reps and sets as you start to get easier uh the last one actually sorry leave the band on so you can do a number of different squats again if you want to get more dynamic change the types of exercises there's a lot of content you don't have to just do a normal squat um but we'll do a normal squat so again hip hinge you're going to come down to 90 degrees or lower if you have that correct range of motion core activation tight trunk squeeze the belly button in you want to push with your knees like you're trying to push that band apart as you stand up as you stand up it's really important to get that isometric glute activation squeeze and then come back down we can also turn this into a sumo squat which would be feet a little bit further than shoulder width apart with your toes pointed out same thing pushing that band apart coming back up so those are three easy safe movements for hips and glutes so now i'm going to show you guys some core movements core and back which is also really important things to be activating so the first one that we're going to do is a dead bug so again on our mat laying flat we're going to bring arms up and knees up to 90 degrees so the idea with this movement is to be able to turn go opposite arm opposite leg at the same time while maintaining a tight core without letting that low back come off the ground so we're gonna take right arm left arm extend while keeping that core tight and switch that's one rep so that's a dead bug our next one is called a bird dog they have funny names but this one's a little bit harder and you might need some to use some other tools for reinforcement on your forearm which i'll explain so you want to make sure that your joints are stacked so those shoulders need to be safely above your elbows and your wrists this is called a quadruped position so you want to be nice and neutral on the spine and flat so if you need to start just to get used to the movement just raising one arm off the ground and coming back down without tilting the pelvis is the key so we don't want any rotation like this sorry i'm in all black so it's a little bit harder to see the idea with this movement however is again opposite arm opposite leg at the same time while maintaining that neutral pelvis so you're gonna bring right arm out squeeze the glute and extend through the heel draw in towards the belly button and then back out and then you'll switch sides this one's a little trickier i would suggest putting a foam roll or a stick a pvc pipe on your back because then if you're tilting in that pelvis that stick's going to fall off so if that sticks falling off you want to try to just stay a little bit tighter smoother with your extension and that should help give you some feedback on how your form is so the last one is a plank there's a ton of different variations of a plank but it's very effective especially if you're doing it correctly so we can do a normal plank just on our forearms again if this is very challenging it's easier if you bring your legs out as you challenge your core and start to get stronger you'll come in a little bit more we also have the variation of a side plank so on your forearm stacking the joints again very important in all of your movements if that's easy bring an arm up bring a leg up start to play with these movements challenge yourself as they get easier so you can do any variations of those planks but these are all things that again are really awesome and important to incorporate daily the more you get comfortable activating these you'll really feel a difference in your lifts you'll feel a difference in your performance and hopefully again the goal is to get stronger and faster so if you guys have any questions for me or amanda this is your time to ask questions and hopefully you just did some of those exercises with me and enjoy them thanks thanks adrian that was fantastic um i see that we have one question in the chat already so i'm gonna go ahead and answer that one since it's here while i'm answering that you guys all have the ability to unmute yourselves so if you would like to ask an actual question in person you're welcome to unmute yourself and ask that after i answered this question but on the food side it looked like how to balance nuts for a vegetarian lacto-ovo athlete so vegetarian athletes may have nuts more often the goal of getting in nuts a few times a week so two to three times a week is really a minimum vegetarians can definitely eat nuts on a daily basis maybe a couple times a day would be fine but it's not going to be their primary protein source it's a better source of a healthy fat it's just going to contribute a little extra protein so the dairy products egg products soy edamame beans lentils those are going to be more of the the staple proteins i would see with most of my lacto-ovo vegetarians and other questions on either the nutrition or the exercise side all right i'm going to remind you that uh that link to do a review of our presentation today is at the top of the chat so if you can scroll up to the top click on that link and make sure you do a review for us we would highly highly appreciate it um oh question for you adrian yeah i see that pm i can send attach a link right now to our children's hospital rehab pages and exercise pages they might not have those specific exercises but they're going to be things that are very similar so i'll link that in the chat here right now all right great so that'll be popping up in the chat shortly but thank you guys for coming today again uh be on the lookout we will be distributing uh the presentation but again if you have um if you have any trouble finding that you can contact me sports nutrition sportsnutrition childrenscolorado.org and then adrian's going to put that link up there for you so i'm going to leave the video running just a little bit longer but thank you guys so much for coming um it was great to have you and i hope you learned something new today have a good day thank you amanda thanks guys i will put that video in right now or lincoln excuse me", "NIAbFKB52EE": "okay so we're gonna be doing blueberry crunch strawberries so we're gonna use our blue raspberry jello and we're gonna make this exactly how you make your strawberry crunch but it's just a different flavor jumble okay one heck of a very jello in One Bowl and we're gonna put our vanilla flavor jell-o pudding in the other Bowl [Applause] our next step is going to be putting half of our butter in each Bowl so we are going to have these up and I'm going to put half in One Bowl and half in the other now make sure your butter is softened okay for the vanilla I am going to add a small amount of almond extract to this man we're going to add a half a cup of flour in each one and then we're going to mix them so I'm gonna start mixing them okay so now we're gonna start mixing our mix together and I just have a fork you're gonna mix it all here because once I get all my unsalted butter mix in I'm gonna use my hands to mix it in pulley okay and here I have my strawberries to the sides that have been washed and dried so now I'm gonna use my hand to just go in and mix everything in okay and I have my trains here all ready to go with wax paper once we get everything all mixed in we're going to put our mix onto our racks paper I have my oven warming on 350 so you want to get it all mixed in okay and now we're gonna do this line the same exact weight and your almond extract just give it give the flavor of that vanilla pudding so once I get this one work Dan we're going to do the same thing now we're gonna go in and mix that in the end really well okay so now that we have everything mixed in really well and you're going to put it on our tray and I always use a little overlay of wax paper because once I put in the oven and let it sit awhile I take it and I move my crumble around by lipping my wax paper so we're gonna put one here and we're gonna put the other one here and we're just going to combine them just like we do their strawberry crumble we're gonna flatten it and we're gonna put it in the oven and let it sit for about six minutes okay we're just combining them and I have another jello box which is the green apple so we're going to be making green apple crunch as well so I'm just mixing it in and then we're just not flattening okay I try not to get any big pieces try to crush it up and threaten it as good as possible so you don't have those big big pieces okay okay so here we have everything spread it out on our baking sheet and now I'm gonna pop it in the oven and let it sit for about six minutes or until it is crisp you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so what I do is I take the other other and I lift the sides of my wet paper to mix it up so it won't burn okay so just moving it around and then we're gonna pop it back in the hub I can feel it drying out it's been in the oven for about three minutes let's move my wet staple around and make sure I don't burn my crumbles and they're gonna pop it back in the oven for another three minutes and it should be ready okay this is how it's looking so far and if you check it periodically you won't have to time it just make sure it's drying out and move your paper around and just spread it back out and pop it back in the oven you want it pretty dry so I'm points you pop it back in the oven for about a minute and a half and it should be ready and what I do is I pop it in the freezer for about five minutes and I put it in my processor I have a small processing pop it in my small processor to chop it up a little bit more and then I coat my berries okay okay so this is going to be our green apple once it has been in the oven and I'm going to move it around so it's not sticking to the wax paper so we're gonna move it around spread it back out pop it back in again okay okay I'm just be careful because it's hot if you choose to do it this way okay okay so there's my blue raspberry crumble and it's toasted just right for me I'm gonna pop it in the freezer for about five minutes let it cool and then I'll transfer it to my small processor okay so my green crumble has been in the oven for about three minutes moving it around we're gonna spread it back out and pop it back in the oven for another three minutes my oven works about six minutes to completely dry out my crumble it depends on your oven how long do you have to leave your crumble in so that's why I take it out periodically and use my wet paper to lip it up and ship it around so it might burn okay okay so I have some classic place here and I use for my droppings if I need it I have melted my white chocolate and I use good deli this time I'm also going to do some strawberries with the more sauce on them I'll show you how to do that that as well and the crumbles we have is strawberry crumble we have our green apple crumble that we made together and we have our blue raspberry crumble that we also make together okay and our larger strawberries we're gonna use for our we're gonna use our morsels on our larger strawberries so we'll have enough room I have some tweezers that came with a kit from baking kits you can use your hands but if you need your tweezers use your tweezers okay and that's what we're going to use and we are going to get started okay so to start we're gonna start with our larger berries I'm going to pull my greenery completely back and we're gonna start to dip you're going to dip all the way to the top and just moving around and make sure you get your berry completely coated okay we're gonna get these twice I'm gonna sit that one there and make sure you have wax paper they're easier to move I've learned that even your silicone mats tend to take the chocolate off the bottom okay so we're going to dip another one gonna go completely down and move your berry around in your chocolate to make sure it is completely coated and once your chocolate has cooled a little bit you don't have to worry about the wrinkling and your chocolate because the berry comes out perfect okay we're gonna put that one down do the same thing with this one make sure you pull your greenery back as far as possible so you can completely coach a berry now we're just shaking off any excess okay we're gonna sit that one down this is going to be the last one dip all the way down move your berry around and make sure all sides are coated and shake off any excess okay I'm for Dunmore so you don't have to cook them twice but for a bigger berry especially when you have these little tiny ones coat them twice and that will give you a large size berry for your customers okay we're gonna let these dry I'm going to dip them again and we're going to add our white chocolate morsels okay okay so what I did was I moved them once they started to dry so they won't have that very big bottom okay and our next step is going to be adding our morsels so I have a toothpick here that I am going to use its position right so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take one of my morsels I'm going to take my toothpick you can do it this way or you can add your lines and apply your morsel okay so I'm gonna start here on the side you can add chocolate here across and just add your morsels okay now we're just going to add them onto those are stuck hannahmont your shoulders and these are some of the more popular berries for gourmet very spoon so you're just adding them onto your beard and you're just gonna completely code it okay like I said you don't have to use your toothpick you can add on one by one or you can add your drizzle lines and add them that way it's up to you whichever way you feel comfortable and we're just going across and adding on and if you want them all turn the same way because they had that little pointy tip just turn the same way okay we're gonna add another line like I said you can use your tweezers whichever way is comfortable for you I make sure your chocolate is not too running so they'll stick in place okay cause you don't want to sliding okay and we're gonna completely coat that berry okay so this is your a complete morsel berry okay and you're just gonna go around the sides you don't have to do the bottom because you want the bottom to be flat and you want you to sit flat okay so that's how you want it to sit when you're packaging and I'm going to show you how to apply them with your lines if you don't have piping bags or plastic bags you can do it this way and I'm going to show you another way you can also add them okay so our second way you can apply your morsels are your piping bag you just gonna put a line or as much chocolate bring it down and around and you're gonna add your your morsels and like I said make sure your chocolate is not too runny because you want to want them to stick in place okay so that's another way you can add them and you're just gonna repeat the process this way is much easier but if you are not familiar with piping bags you can do it the other way okay I'll sit it down and I'm gonna start adding them to my berry to get one more here okay I'm sitting to a flat so I move you over a little bit we're gonna go back in I'm just trying to make your lines as clean as possible sure so you don't have too much of your chocolate sitting in the middle and just go all the way around on the side and leave the bottom empty okay we're going to completely coat that one and that'll be our second berry okay so that's going to be our second buried okay okay so now that we're done with our mortal berries and that's how they're going to look once completed and you're going to remove your six and you're going to put them in your holders okay so now we're going to do our crunch berries I do blue raspberry punch first so we're just gonna dip all the way down and completely coat your berry shake off a little bit of your excess and what I do is I just take the berry and run it across the glass and when you don't have runny chocolates you don't have to worry about your chocolate dropping into your bowl but to keep that from happening you can place your berry in your hand and go around and completely cold there's strawberry so that's going to be your blue raspberry crunch strawberry gonna put that one there okay now we're going to do our green apple crunch okay so we're going to take one of our strawberries pull the greenery all the way back we're going to dip and completely coat shake off and as much excess chocolate as possible scrape it across the bottle we're gonna take a handful and we're going to coach our Barry and that's the easiest way to code it to me okay and it's going to be your green apple crunch berry okay we are going to do our strawberry crunch pull the greenery all the way back dip completely coat your berry shake off any excess drag it along the bottle and we wrote it with our strawberry crunch okay that's going to be your strawberry crunch okay you can mix them and make a mixture very but there you have it you have your blue raspberry crunch strawberry your green apple crunch

okay", "UwdkcsaI9lw": "hey there guys jeremy here and welcome back to the channel so today we're going to be talking about the better delights delta 8 blue raspberry gummies from the company creating better days and i gotta say the name that they chose for this line better delight is great because it definitely delivers there now for those of you who don't know as of the recording of this video delta 8 thc is a fully legal form of thc that is derived from hemp it's about one third to one half the potency of delta 9 thc which is its close cousin that's founded marijuana and the experience that you should have with it when used appropriately is purely relaxing it kind of strips away the potential for the paranoia or whimsical type of high that you can find with delta 9. also no munchies there's none of that insatiable appetite boost that you get with delta 9 a lot of times now it can have a little bit of an appetite stimulating effect but it's really nowhere near what people would define as the munchies i've just found myself getting slightly more snacky sometimes when i use delta 8. now i always like to give kudos to companies that can put out a product with excellent design and packaging and these guys definitely deliver on that as well it just looks so clean and professional and trustworthy that's the big thing because this industry there's so much out there that is not trustworthy in the hemp and cannabis industry these guys i have been carrying them here in lovely leaf naturals for a long time before they even made delta eight gummies carrying their gummies carrying some of their other products and i have never seen anything but absolute professionalism from creating better days and this product is no exception these are 10 milligram gummies so each gummy is going to have 10 milligrams of delta 8 thc in it their blue raspberry as i mentioned before and then there's 60 of them in the big jar they're also doing a 30 count jar but yeah full transparency i do carry creating better days in my shop and on the website so i've been carrying them for a while and they've never given me a reason to doubt them so you can get these over at the lovely leaf naturals website loveleafnaturals.com i'll put a link down in the description they're 49.99 for the 60 count jar we don't have the 30 count jars in just yet i don't know what those will be going for i think either 30 or 35 once we actually get them in the shop but yeah you can get these right now but stick around until the end of the video and i'm going to give you guys a discount code to get 15 off your first order of these so the first thing you're going to see whenever you open these up is that there is a seal across the top it's a tamper resistant seal that makes sure that you know if anybody has opened this jar before you it also says potent use responsibly and we will talk a little bit more about that in a minute but when you open it up you are going to see these square blue raspberry gummies they've got a sugar coating and they are delicious and i'm going to try one right now and yeah they're so yummy i hate that i can only eat a couple of them i kind of want to eat the whole jar now the consistency of them is a little gooier than i generally like my gummies but honestly this is not supposed to be eaten like candy so when people get into the flavor or the the consistency of gummies like this that always kind of bothers me i know i just talked about how good they are i mean it's not a bad thing for them to taste good but honestly you shouldn't worry too much about that because this is more like you're taking a vitamin than you're sitting down to have a snack for example the gummies that we manufactured under our brand name friendly hemp here in the store they taste extremely hempy because there's about 40 milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract in each of our little tiny gummies there's not much room for anything else so we don't overload them with sugar we just let them taste hempy but that's not me knocking these guys at all these gummies are amazing i wouldn't change a thing i'm just making the point that when it comes to somebody buying gummies in the cbd space or the delta 8 space or even the delta 9 space don't worry so much about the consistency or the flavor because you're probably just gonna be eating one maybe two and then you're not gonna eat anymore for a good long time now getting back to the subject of using this responsibly i always tell people start low and go slow whether they're here in my shop or they're asking me questions personally about cbd and delta 8. delta 8 you really really really want to start at the lowest dose i would recommend only taking one of these gummies if it's your first time using it waiting several several hours just to see what it's going to do and then maybe upping the dosage next time you want to take it i would not crank down two three of these the first time you've ever taken it now just to give a personal anecdote about this the first time i ever tried delta eight i was woefully ignorant of the potency of this stuff i was using an oil tincture instead of the gummies but i took about 30 milligrams equivalent to about three of these gummies 30 milligrams waited about four hours nothing happened i have a really really slow metabolism that was a big contributing factor to this but then i decided okay well i feel nothing i'll take another 30 milligrams see what happens about an hour hour and a half later is when it all decided to hit at once i was in the shop at that point and i ended up having to close down the shop an hour early i was laid out on our couch i threw up three times in the bathroom and i was just a mess i called my wife and i said you have to come get me because i cannot drive home and i was fully there mentally but my body just gave up on me so i tell people that as a cautionary tale start low and go slow whether you're taking it in a gummy form like this using a vape using an oil tinger using flour whatever you're doing start low and go slow and then just like every other cannabis product that we carry here in lovely leaf naturals these guys are sporting a nice little qr code on the back of their packaging so that you can see the lab results for this product that is a standard that we maintain very very seriously here at lovely

out exerciser made by GNC pro performance brand it's amino energy advanced so this energy thing is the gotcha you know when I first bought this I thought it was just an amino and then as I was reading it I see here there's a lots of caffeine in here so they're saying two scoops has a hundred milligrams of caffeine four scoops 200 never take eight scoops that's way too much so 100 120 grams is the standard cup of coffee you know so that's not bad five grams of amino and two scoops 10 grams and four scoops four scoops isn't even quite a bit but that's you're saying that's true that's throughout the day you wouldn't take that out one time so so that's that's the energy part you're getting the energy from the caffeine so I see it's same stuff on the label five grams of all aminos to help your muscles build rebuild after exercising increase energy and focus energy and focus is coming from the caffeine this is a fruit punch fruit punch flavors so usually with the perk out Potter's you go with fruit plant or chocolate most of the other flavors tastes nasty you know sometimes the blueberry and the grape is okay but you know you you're really taking a chance so you can see this is a small bottle most of them are going to the smaller bottles now it's more concentrated this this is always nice to say see free up bands so free of banned substances that wasn't always true with workout stuff just in the last few years or so they're trying to get things cleaned up so I it has all the standard aminos in here there's quite a few so it's got a list of all of them all of the important ones ten calories per two scoops so that's Harley no calories three grams of carbs that's that's a another area that you would get the energy from is the carbs it's got green tea extract that's where some of the caffeine is coming from green coffee bean extract here that's it doesn't say anything about caffeine there but I'm sure there's green coffee bean and then here says black tea black tea is just a normal teas guess the green tea stuff is cool but you know if you uh if you're older and you're worried about your heart you may maybe want to watch your caffeine intake so so just to run through the list of the the aminos here taurine glutamine l are arguing l loosening beta-alanine l-citrulline hello i saline l valine l-tyrosine l is still dying lysine l l can't pronounce that one I know I know what I mean l fearing a methionine that's all that's all the common wanting a especially the first few okay so for my preference I don't know I'm not really I I don't like this here if I would notice that in the store I probably wouldn't have bought it okay it was cheap it was only like it what it was on her 20 bucks I think so okay it's it's something to drink into instead of pop each one each one of these things come come with a different it's still love pretty good here so you can see it's just a powder scoops probably at the bottom small small scoop so they're saying two of those two two of those is a one serving so it's it's getting late here so I'm only gonna do a half of school because I don't like the caffeine so just to try out the taste here yeah well it mixes up here there's still just a couple little flakes around the bottom there mix up pretty good okay okay even that little bit tastes great tastes like a raspberry pop or something like that not not really an orange pop but there's that other one that's like a red red bow okay see ya bye oh if you want more information on the aminos I did another video on the Minos where I talked about quite a bit so you can go and check that one out I'll put the link down below for you okay see ya", "K623dRXL5Yw": "hey guys it's Liana fishbowl um today is Friday afternoon and it's March 21st and I look like a hot mess I'm sorry I went to Special Olympics today so I'm kind of looking gross um but I wanted to do a quick video about the things I've been taking my pigtails bother me um and I wanted to do it while it was fresh on my mind because I'm just starting a new cycle so um I'm gonna do that today that's okay I do want to apologize for this gross looking thing right here and that is a shadow I'm sitting here one I don't need the Lighting's terrible in here this right here I just got that so it's one of those gross spots I got this one's out that one's out and that one's out there like these blood blisters that come up on my face I don't know it was crazy so I had them lasered off yesterday but um anyway so here is what I take after all that here's what I take right now now um I did a video several months ago it's probably been six months ago or longer about what I taken some of the things have changed because I've been diagnosed with MTHFR so that's why I'm redoing this video mainly um so let's start with the things that I take specifically because I have MTHFR now okay we'll start with these I did not plan this I'm just doing it for fun um this is b6 and I take this and I'm sorry this is gonna be backwards on here it's p5p and I take 50 milligrams once a day this is a active coenzyme a v6 so it's a more active form with MTHFR you have a inability or less ability to metabolize in methylate vitamin B's so that's why I'm taking these specialties this one and these actually all three were based off of a prescription drug called met next and I just took the doses from there and I bought them over the counter instead of having a prescription so that's what I'm doing these and it's a that's something that a lot of doctors will prescribe for MTHFR so then so there's b6 it's the P 5 P 15 milligrams don't put all these in the information below um and this is best sold our brand all of these are this is met foulin it's called its folate this is not folic acid and I like I keep saying I need to do a video why I don't want to take folic acid and I will but if you have MTHFR you do not need to be on folic acid quite honestly in my opinion nobody should be on folic acid even if you don't have it because this is a more readily available form for your body anyway so it cuts out the middleman and it's directly absorbed so that's why I take this this is folate and I take 800 micrograms I take three of these a day so that puts me at 2,400 micrograms my re wants me on 3,200 and the other comes from the prenatal I'll talk about a minute so that's what this is you can see it says under there it's met Folan it's folate and this is also best so far and then I take my b12 it's called actually not pronounce this methyl cobalt cobalt cobalt lemon Kaituna or try and pronounce this yesterday but there's the big word backwards I take five thousand micrograms of this twice a day and take one in the morning and one at night and this is the active form of b12 another reason you know like I said before active forms is most important and this is also by Sogard this is sublingual you're supposed to put it on your tongue I'll show you what it looks like it's really the the 1000 milligram ones I found dissolved very well but these don't this little pink pill I just chew it and swallow it and I take it before I take your pick me out so like I said I'd do two of these a day and then I also take a low-dose baby it's a BS one this is just Walmart brand it's the 80 milligrams low dose I take one of these a day I start I take it the morning that's for MTHFR as well for clotting issues now once I get pregnant they will change that to inject some color but not so but that's for now and then I also take this magnesium is chelated magnesium it's by blue you bought it and it is something I take because it helps with the absorption and all these other vitamins that I'm taking for any thi far and I take two of these that's my husband's wash my hands so I take two of these a day they're 200 milligrams one in the morning what night they also it's supposed to help with detoxing your liver and cleaning you outside should my son healthy okay so now for egg quality oh I know what I'm doing this one first um turmeric is also something I type for MTHFR it was something recommended by dr. Lynch I'll put his website below um it helps with inflammation and it's all natural as a route I take one of these a day it's a funny looking car but to you it's yellow you can also get this and like essential oils and you guess you could drink it I've seen it in all kinds of different forms so take one of these in the morning okay so now egg quality I take this this is the gold standard for quality coq10 I take two of these a day so I take 1200 milligrams a day I think you don't have to take that much but because I have such poor eye image I figured the more the merrier and it can't hurt you I get these at Puritans pride on the website and they're very inexpensive and it's good it's a very good brand I've read a lot of good reviews about it so this stuff can be very pricey so um they usually have like a buy one get one free sell so I'll get two of these my husband takes one and a pill a day and I take these I take one morning and one at night this is supposed to help improve air quality in a match levels also take NAC I've been taking that for a long time there's some studies out there that show that helps improve from fertility and pecos patients I'm not polycystic but I take it just in case it also helps with inflammation and endometriosis so I take two of these a day I take 600 milligrams in the morning 600 milligrams at night and they're just white pills I also get these from Puritans Prai the same place I get the coke q10 little website online you know it's easy to get to and it's not that expensive at all and then I take for also for a quality lr9 you say that I take one of these a day 1000 milligrams it's just this it's just something that's recommended by a lot of doctors um it helps with I think it's like a super antioxidant I believe I can't remember I take so much stuff now isn't that terrible but it's an antioxidant helps kind of make your eggs like they're supposed to be pure better I'm also for a quality and I'm out and I need to get this I have not taken it in the last few days the royal jelly and pollen I talked about this before this is some of the stuff I've been taking for a long time a teaspoon in the morning teaspoon at night you can see I'm out I need to get more you see how much I have to buy it's expensive so I have to kind of pick and choose sometimes and this is one of those things I don't have to have some of those I have to have so this is this one is by YS eco bee farms and it's 40,000 milligrams of the jelly and 32 thousand milligrams of the bee pollen and it's in honey and it's like the little Jill they say to get it in this one but it's the best way to take it just because it's more pure that way it's just more of what the way it's intended to be rather than a bill but I know people take the pills too I also take vitamin E just because it's something my body needs can I take 1000 milligrams once a day need to be careful with this you won't take too much of it I think it's loosing your blood from what I understand as well as the official can do the same thing so I backed off I used to take three of these now I only take two of them because I have the baby aspirin now I take two of these a day this is the highest strength I can find locally this is these this this and my vitamin D I'll Shane a minute are off from Sam's Club this is 14 milligram fourteen hundred milligrams and it's got a nice high dose I don't know if you can read that now of the EPA in the DHA the EPA it's got 640 milligram 47 milligrams in the DHA is 250 milligrams I mean this helps with inflammation endometriosis egg quality it's just overall really good for your body so I take one of these the morning and one of these that night and then I take this is also from Sam's this is my vitamin d3 he says I think yeah 5,000 I take I had some blood tests done after it's been about a year and a half ago after the hospital incident in Orlando we were at Disney World with no weird freakish anyway as a whole nother vlog I went to a rheumatoid doctor and he took my blood levels on all kinds of stuff and one of the things that showed up is that I was deed efficient so you need to type d3 if your D deficient and of course get sunlight and all the things that you're supposed to do to get that so I take 5,000 IU's in the morning and at night and it's a teeny tiny little pill I'll show you the ones that kind of stand out as odd looking plus I'm gonna show you every pill but they're tiny little clear pills I take so I take those one more like okay so then there's the prenatal because I have MTHFR I've really been looking for a prenatal it doesn't have folic acid there are sun you can get online that are a little less expensive than us but I just felt like for me I want to make sure I was taking the best of the best and I feel like that this product is one of the best out there it's designed by a doctor who is heavily involved with the mth RFR movement and trying to get the word out on how important it can be to not just pregnancy and infertility but for all all overall health so dr. Lynch has designed this along with tons of other supplements um and this is by seeking help and you can go on their website I'll post it below and this is called the optimal prenatal okay and this is what it looks like in the bottle it is empty right now I have left us this little plastic preservative thing it Cindy I'm out of it the downside of this is you have to take eight of these a day you take three in the morning three at lunch and two at night okay that's a lot of pills but like I said I just really feel like this is a excellent prenatal this is not one of those that you get for $10 at the drugstore that's gonna have minimum amount of stuff and it may not be quality product it's not you know it's other than spectrum this has more of go work this in it it has more of this in it and more of this you know that's not sublingual okay those three things definitely you know those are things I take specifically for MTHFR I was already doing that before I discovered this and this has more of it which makes it even better so it's all methylated type vitamins it's all more readily available for your body your body doesn't have to fight to absorb it it's also gotten nas at all in it which is great for a quality it has milk thistle which helps your liver detox and I definitely noticed that it helps that I am very regular as far as my movements go and I don't like to talk about that but I mean I take one of these and within an hour I know it's working is cleaning my body out it's got red raspberry choline bilberry extract all kinds of great things in it so definitely and it's also got more coke you Tim so it this is something if you have into chef's are I definitely recommend trying it but if you don't and you just want to have a really really good prenatal it's good anyway so yeah here's my predicament this is what I'm getting - um I went online to order another thing of this and I will tell you this is not cheap this is around $50 yeah I mean yeah I realize you can go to Walmart and get it for ten or twelve dollars and you get the little cheese and all that but it's not the quality you pay for what you get sometimes and I do believe that and for me specifically in my condition I'm not saying I'm not knocking somebody it does it but I'm just telling you when you're at my point in life and you're almost 40 and you're looking at having to pay thousands of dollars for IVF you're gonna pay to get the right future so I'm doing that and it's not cheap but it was about 40 or 50 dollars and if you go on their website the first time you order you can take a little survey and they'll give you a code and it's like 25 precise so I got this 25 percent off since it's my first time to take it I got on the other day and it was out of stock sounds like crud welcome to you well so I decided to try this I know this looks crazy yeah that is their prenatal vitamin in a protein powder craziest thing I've ever heard of is huge bottle you see like a post of my head it's as big as my head it's actually bigger than my head this is a 30 day supply I'll tell you about it in it let me show you it looks like inside I got vanilla yes what it looks like comes with a little scoop it smells good it smells like any other vanilla protein powder out there now why did we hit a protein powder one they were out of stock of my rabbit bait the prenatal - this eliminates eight pills out of my regimen every day which is amazing when you're swallowing as me pills as you see me smiling this that's nice three I was paying and getting a protein powder anyway and I love my protein powder for breakfast and the protein powder I've been using which I'm not going to talk about the brand at all but it had been suspected of having high in it when your MTHFR positive you have a problem a detox anyway so you don't want more junk in you than you have to so knowing that this was designed by a doctor that it was thoroughly looked through especially for MTHFR patients protein powder for my breakfast plus my prenatal online I thought well I can't lose now I'm just going to warn you this is about $90 okay the protein powder I was purchasing was around $40 and my prenatal was around 40 so if you look at what I was spending on my protein powder and my prenatal together that's what you're spending all this so I'm not spending more than I was anyway but it is definitely a very pricey protein powder but you're getting your prenatal and your protein powder all in one okay I've been on at 2 days I love it sorry my husband interaction fee right in the middle of this I almost died actually ok so back to the protein powder I've tried it for two days I've been very impressed with how full it keeps me it's one scoop it's 120 calories 14 grams of protein it has all kinds of your proton vitamin a's your vitamin c b is that it means everything is the daily allowance or more except for calcium vitamin a magnesium which I'm already taking anymore of sodium which we don't need that much of potassium but you get tossing them through your bananas you bit nice um so it's made from pea protein and rice protein evaporated cane juice natural flavours I love that it's 9 it's gluten free it's dairy free it's it's just to me it don't contain milk it does not contain eggs no fish no shellfish and no tree nuts no soy no peanuts no wheat no GMO no artificial colors no artificial flavors and no artificial preservatives I challenge you to find many protein powders out there that can say that and give you all the nutrients that you need for your prenatal all-in-one it really is a cool thing and me I'm definitely gonna stick to it I've tried it I the way I eat it where the way I've eaten it the last two day I got the vanilla and here's why because if I want to do a vanilla smoothie with like fruit I can use that but today I have used it for chocolate and I always get vanilla because I can add cocoa powder to it and make it chocolate without having to have a chocolate in a vanilla protein powders I make sense and cocoa didn't have much in it so I used a little Hershey's cocoa just real cocoa I use pb2 in it and I scoop of that I used a half a banana almond milk and some chia seed and then I put the banana was frozen that up a little ice in it mixed it up on my ninja and whose delicious I'll post some pictures in my video of it but it held me until I drank it around 7:15 this morning at helmet chill name I mean I really wasn't hungry and then about noon I got my stomach started growling yesterday I drank it and it held me until almost 2 o'clock but I drank it a little later that morning so means it's not something you would want to put in the water I've seen people who put protein shake in the water and they just shake it up in with those mixer bottles and shrink yet I don't think that I don't do that anyway because I have to have it tastes good but I wouldn't do that with any protein powder but I'd definitely probably do with that consistency is really good I don't think it's grainy or nasty or anything no more than what I was having taking before so I just highly recommend that so um I'm taking that I'm taking a protein shake for my prenatal it's kind of weird and I love that now last thing and then I'm gonna quit because this video is already public way over time I bought this at the store the other day you say I'm on my staff for the week cuz here it is this is um Friday right here so I'll have my Friday night and then I have my Saturday but it's broken down into Sunday morning Sunday noon Sunday evening Sunday bedtime now I don't take anything at noon but I have so many that fit in my morning that I used this and this for my morning so this is my morning and then I don't ever pay thing and evening and then I have my bedtime it's really cool and they just flip open I'm sure you've seen these I'm like a total old person they just flip open like this hmm definite supposed to open that way there so um I recommend getting one of these it saves me a whole lot of time I was spending 10 minutes dumping vitamins out into my hand every morning and every evening I think I counted I take like 16 or 18 vitamins if I that was when I was taking this prenatal but now that I don't have to take those 8 that cuts down a lot um so that's what I'm taking right now um it's like a Walmart pharmacy in here at net nor a health store but if you have any questions you can leave your comments below and I'd be glad to help answer those I'm gonna post links to put on I'm gonna post a list of what I'm taking the dosages and how many times a day as well as where I get certain items so if I forget something just feel free to ask me but um thanks for watching and I hope that this will help somebody in their quest to find I'm not I'm not a doctor I mean just going to put that out there I'm not a doctor I'm not saying that this is the perfect solution but I'm saying it's what I'm using right now I've already tweet from my last video of what I'm taking it's a process and as you go through infertility you will find that out but um that's what I'm taking right now so good luck everybody and baby dust in thanks for watching I'll check y'all later bye", "iyxaeehr9Go": "my guest today is dr. van berkel who's when my heroes and we're going to talk about him a little bit more later and why we're doing what we're doing we had quite a few questions this weekend hey what are you promoting which lab I know this is nothing to do about promoting a laugh this is about promoting you being able to understand your patients better and to do this specific testing you might need to find out what their foundational problem is and then dr. Murtagh one that coined that term we do functional labs but what's the foundation of the person and we're going to talk about that a little bit here but let me talk about a couple of disclaimers first this to make it clear this is my work that I'm talking about my formulations as I have formulas dr. Merkel's research is clinical practice we are talking about so this isn't zymogen speaking and we are doing this on their website but this has to do with us and our research they don't take responsibility but we're talking about it hey since we talked about that type of thing neither one of us are employees we're customers for sure and I don't get paid mutable dr. Merkel for doing this webinar I am sure although I believe so much of this company I believe it's the number one company in manufacturing in the world for nutraceutical so I actually spend my hard-earned cash and am I am a shareholder so I want them to go I want your practice to go it's important that you realize we're not killing you use this specific nutrition to help this disease doesn't do it I mean that that's not what I do my license allows me to help improve function through the spine and through things that support a chiropractic adjustment those of you that are nature pass or and these ordeals gave a slightly different approach but that's the way most of our license will stay throughout the country so our job is to evaluate function find out where is dysfunctional and to improve the function when we improve function the symptoms go away because there's no longer a dis ease in many many cases and you will also see that that we really believe that nutrition does help to improve punches and so does the chiropractic adjustment so is creating a safe room this room this type of thing so also you understand we're never saying to replace a drug with nutrition what we're saying this use you Trish to get the optimal function and if the name to blame the disease goes away that's not our problem what nature take that so our job is to help people get healthier and to give the right nutrition and structural care except it helps people to do that but I am a formulator of is the buyer interject nutrition it is manufactured by design gym for you but I able to formulator on this entire line and if I have been formulating now for almost 40 of my 42 years of practice I have developed over 150 different nutritional nutraceuticals and in my opinion we have very vast improvement of anything I've ever done in the bio energy x line and they have allowed us to offer a special through the end of this month we'd love to have you know about and take advantage of if you buy six bottles of any of the file interjection nutrition we're talking about you get one bottle free you might tend to get two bottles crazy by 24 or more you get up to five bottles free of the biological increasing so as you can also see here if you're terrific you dollars or more and there's a remote esket it's kind of hard if you do kinesiology not to have the test kits and they're available for you so we ask you to take advantage of that to preface my remarks in inductor Merkel's remark when we talk about the foundation of health good heart always said and I followed good heart for the last almost 50 years he said structure rules function so if the light switches off the light bulb doesn't come on I don't care how big light bulb you put in and when we treat the spine as a chiropractor we're really treating brain so we treat I say a chiropractor that doesn't above just above atlas is a discerner of a chiropractor we adjust the spine we teaching our servers how to adjust a craniosacral mechanism we check for electromagnetic pollution we make sure we evaluate the nutrition with blood air or provocative challenges urine challenges are condemning they talk about a little bit of not now definitely later we're practicing this this webinar and a couple others will do between now in January because every year we have a blowout and we have a seminar to where we bring the best speakers in the world in and dr. Van Wert will be there helping the student get you to understand functional medicine and foundational blood testing hair analysis and have a blender together and how to do provocative challenges to release heavy metals that are locked into the cells and with dmsa you open up at you can identify them and just help patients above and beyond what you've ever been able to view before there's a lot of the problems we have are toxic stores this year we also are going to have dr. David singer the premier chiropractor in teaching you how to open up a new practice how to expand your privacy Disney patient so it's incredible dr. metal beyond I will be on and so we got your miracle doctor senior it's gonna be an amazing so put that down the last weekend of the month in January dr. Merkel going to come on a couple of times with me they're right some puzzle pieces to get you thinking about foundational and functional medicine so emotional stress ties into this as well and then toxic accumulation so as a chiropractor and I eat sleep and drink chiropractic I didn't become a chiropractor because I flunked out of med school became a chiropractor because I was paralyzed from the waist down they carried me in he is just mean I walked out I was actually saying to be a dentist and I changed my life and I have had an incredible life helping people and I found there's more than one cause of dysfunction I found their structural causes electrical pollution problems nutritional team appearances there's allergies and sensitivities emotional stresses and toxic accumulation so what we do is work on all all six at the same time the couple's the six steps to walnuts I'm going to go over a patient it was one of the patients I came in to see my son dr. Brett room hall my oldest other the orthopedic surgeon his wife has her doctorate in physical therapy dr. Brett Sakura projector and dr. Brock is a Dennis so we we look at this and all different angles and we collaborate together and there's no such thing as an enemy and miss in this field only to work together and help each other this particular girl has been under medical care and in fact what happened is she went in for a complexion problem she have real bad acne they put her on some I believe accutane other drugs to try to cook her complexion and a very short time she started manifesting woot lisandro chemicals and so medical diagnosis now in that chiropractic evaluation medical diagnosis with Mozie lupus so this young girl would be birdie in and you can see just a vital there she's 5 foot 6 145 blood pressure is 106 / 68 so we started taking g sympathetic problems maybe thyroid low blood pressure here maybe in low ferritin low iron this thing's start running through your mind going on plus an autoimmune condition started then diagnosed her pulse ox should be in Arizona and kidney should be ninety eight percent her score down to 83 heart rate was 95 so it makes you think gosh she's pumping water instead of blood oxygenated blood so she's having to pump faster to try to get what's there so we'll look at the blood test and see what happens but what we're going to show you aureus is what I really learned from from dr. Merkel which really aligns us I have taught the use of hair analysis since 1973 all over the world and correlating here with blood I never did until I started looking at dr. Urkel's work and he does that in a reporting system that just makes so simple all of you become smarter because they've gone into the literature they fought the record-journal to give you the literature that tells you what that means according to the literature and a consequent dating you see it went from hold dear Lucas indigestion poor concentration memory anxiety and stress at age or are you kidding me of 17 years old I cause everybody anxiety and stressful I sure didn't have any and already she's having these kinds of symptomatic expressions so here's your blood and this is going to be recorded so you can look up close and personal with this I'm sorry there's so much information here we do not have time to go into I'm going to highlight it but the recording is there you go back and study them out and then dr. Merkel's you know how you can look at other Towson i'll be teaching this at every seminar that I do but basically he has made this report so good if it's white it's in the optimal ranges if it's yellow is a little bit of a problem if it's red you better really get a close attention going on here and as he said if it's blue it's code blue so we're only going to talk about the blues here today and you can go back and study your leisure because he is put in here in this report what each one of these things need and the correlations of them and what the priorities might be in what so let's look at our or HDL at 22 unbelievably level and we know HDL is a good protective kind of cholesterol it takes the fats away from the extremities and puts it back in the liver to be processed eighty percent to ninety percent of your HDL come from your liver perfection not from diet so there's something we have to look at right to start with your total cholesterol is high what we call the good cholesterol is low prob umeda globulin ratio is off so we're looking here I'll leave you some stress in the kidney area for sure the real clincher is we look at c-reactive protein this means if you're on fire so here's a 70 year old girl fire and of course that's one of the major things that causes the autoimmune reaction and loop two on the body research has shown us now inflammation is underlying diabetes cancer arthritis and pick a number when blood council was low hemoglobin was low so we were right about anemia just looking at ever case history from monocytes are low so immune system is not responding very well to potential infection you going on in the body even though we assume up here or poly eggs are high and lymphocytes are lone we look down here further though here's the real clincher this is the separate shows potential alleged reaction in the body inflammation going into the body a body potentially attacking itself and we look up here under healthy we want her her sed rates be no higher than six even pathological we give you both the clinical lab studies and what optimal is from many different research hilarious so we never wanted to go about 200 on me above 20 and she's 99 so here's what I start said asking myself why why does a girl this age have this kind of problem and then we started running hair analysis and comparing it to the blood studies and then found out dr. Merkel actually did that and a computer written report and that's when we hooked up and have been following his working out for many years so you can see this particular young girl have arsenic barium bismuth cadmium uranium nickel silver tin and titanium remember yellows a little bit red you getting in trouble and blue really high compared to optimal levels and then when we look down under good or good minerals the trace minerals calcium is way high when you get calcium and magnesium high you're putting into a lot of the researchers to them your analysis when that goes high together and sodium potassium go low together that is Miss calcium miss magnesium it's not like you're eating too much it's like it's leaking out for long so to speak and going out into the extremities of the body with high calcium magnesium also need potassium you look at adrenal exhaustion and exhaustion is deposition of calcium and magnesium we're not going to go this whole report but copper being high high copper literally increases the oxidation rate of adrenaline if burned your adrenal glands up no wonder that show in there so we've got to get the copper out we don't stop there look at all the different highest lows and everything going on through here but one thing we always look at that we're really worried about is if we start getting some of the heavy metals that are very toxic and poisonous in the body like uranium I have found a rhenium very high in Arizona Colorado on Nevada and this particular happens to be from Arizona but I've also seen it I in Texas I've seen a high in California and a lot of other places but particularly to western states they did uranium mining year during the atomic weapon testing and exploding arrow through here so what we've learned to do and I develop looking at these tests together only a path remedies that helps to trigger the release of all of this heavy metals in here why you balance out the good trace minerals if you try to balance these guys out or even try to balance out the blood without detoxifying you haven't read the literature you start reading what each one of these heavy metal does and it messes up the enzyme system the body 5003 ends on system the body eighty percent have magnesium in twenty percent have zinc in it and these guys displaced good minerals and supplement it with the toxic metals and that's a major problem going on so what dr. Merkel's product is and he caused a science-based nutrition because he's based it on science yes he has put in here interpretation of the lab results what is the hair media relationships are there what is the coronary assessment i'm just going to fly with you don't have time to go into much to cover what is the hyper cluster early Mia what do you get off of that let's just look at that he says the quest Rosalie low cholesterol is very important to immune system production of hormone energy cell and nerve structures and then it goes on to talk about there's good things that you can do to help increase the natural intake and and build up of cholesterol in the body the good it's more dangerous to have low cholesterol than high cholesterol because of the hormones and the good stuff is formed here so we leaves krill oil use fish oil so that says the report gosh Bruce ability of essential fatty acid there's a low blood sugar problems how do you say that well but here is the nutrients here's the input from things that we found in the blood tests and here are some potential nutrients that you could give now i am not going to mention specific products in here but all the ones that i use you could come from bio interject or from zymogen and sell food manufacturers vocal zymogen products and bioenergetic so there is one product they have a wall that has all these in and I use that a great deal dehydration is also showing up here you get that for the most odium high protein also gastrointestinal why do you get that uric acid while you're very nitrogen the creatinine are all off and so you use all this information and you'll see in the reporting system it actually said gosh with low blood good cause low blood serum the new church you want to look at our and look down here for malic acid and magnesium use some activated be user source of calcium so each one of these here's all the symptoms that make the science say look to the thyroid here's the kind of problem and depression and lupus I gained 20 pounds of the last 12 months those are all the kinds of symptoms you can see in a thyroid problem same as anemia here's the blood report here's the statistics here's how you correlate to here with it I never I use other reporting system is when I keep coming back he is because they don't correlate blood and hair together and the doctor van system is the one that does possible infection and or inflammation why we here is what studies to show you that we've got a little bit them that there's a whole big paragraph document all that for you those findings are further supported by other blood tests that are going on in there and what do you want to do up I wish they haven't done that it it talks about the chronic wasting system symptoms that are going on again documented here and he goes on to say the alveolar gloss in volume ratio less than 120 is an ominous sign so there's certain things that will be pointed out to you that you might want to do further testing even further testing and which one you want are also listed in the reporting other noted blood values creatine kinase monocytes s GOG here's the nutrition to help support that very high business uses any body nutrition to do that very high uranium we use a homeopathic uranium two triggers the release of that also you want to use evening body regular nutrition for that as well as iodine so when you have iodine in the body it helps to give you the good kind of iodine we also use landed or thyroid to help make sure you mix with that iodine and get in out of the body about hair silver how about Hell calcium copper zirconium aluminum again they're all here for your research but we cannot take time to go over these like you would do in the study now imagine you have this report this you say wow this is amazing take you to do this well it took you no time to do this because this is all automated you send the blood tests in dark veil over that for you in a moment and it comes out to your computer 24 hours later or or 48 and and the report is printed out for you you didn't have to know all this stuff the report comes up or and you learn as you go so if you're just getting started in this dr. van will will show you in his work which tests he'd recommend you do and he has a regular panel merkel panel that we use a lot of times we'll add vitamin d did one today where you have it canceled as well and we did a mono study because the symptoms of generals happened but all this is laid out for you and then this print outcomes where you sit down review and give it to your patient and I think dr. van actually how's your sap given the report in he called to see if they have any questions so he's on mated a lot of things here so what's going on with aluminum cavity of nickel 10 titanium here are magnesium here's all the values that we just found then he also elicited the report for you lifestyle dietary recommendations so you don't have to sit down and type all this in all the time things to avoid balancing blood sugar how about strength tree is that good for how much water consumption and then we've listed here for you in our reporting we have a list either while inner Jack's which is made by zymogen or zymogen product which is a over 250 products you choose from but this particular patient we need homey and packing Iranian we've got a key laid out for bad guys as we start releasing from the tissue we always want to use an essential fatty acid when we start releasing the homeopathic uranium other heavy metals will start falling out so you want to use a chelation product with VMs a EDTA cetera those are are definitely available we teach you how to use those in the seminar adrenal support is very important here doctor van okay he doesn't will give everybody Adreno he gives everybody realities it but if you don't take care of these underlying problems here you'll have them on adrenal support forever and never fix the file so you want to clear up the heavy metals get rid of the toxins why you support their adrenals and then do other things to help support those adrenals as well krill oil and the big believer in that it's very effective one that I used its manufactured in the zymogen line is like taking three or four or five regular fish oil capsules I get along better with this dr. Brett and I have to work to keep our cholesterol higher ours has inherently low from our genetic predisposition this is an answer parish me I don't burp it up for Belgium and selves ate my cholesterol into a healthy range again we do halogen detox we have a homeopathic chlorine fluorine bromine that was a lot of reason she ought to have an autoimmune problems oh gosh you never give again with autoimmune problems well we do and we monitor it and you may have autoimmune numbers come up slightly your TSH came up a little while usually the male burn our lives in three to six months and the patient gets well every cell in the body needs iodine so if you're trying to not give them what they really need to prevent from changing the numbers I think that's misguided so I know some people disagree with that but put it to the test dr. me from lab Rex agrees with that many of the other people have done this for years and got incredible results with it and digestive I like the plant enzymes like because they're wide range from ph all the ways of 10 phone so detox food fit for zymogen has dozens on their incredible you always want to make sure you balance the whole assisting you want to balance methylation the number one thing the body does all they want to take in oxygen it reduces a gets rid of carbon dioxide that's what we do to stay alive for oxygen animals the secondary thing you do all day long is methylation and many many people do not have enough b12 folic acid and many people have genetic problems with it cannot convert the into the right nutrients the methyl tetrahydrofolate so there are some products that you can get that have that a standalone and other supporting that items and nutritionals that help your methylation process I checked every patient for them that that activated bees actually have activated for gases b12 immune support so we invite us apport that's peer support and very specific nutrition and we talked about that in the seminars and we've done on the webinar liver detox nutrients I have a whole amount that I have put together for that anti-inflammation deep plan nutrients specific minerals when you step on the heavy metals out and you want to make sure you give the proper tracing them back in there this particular person need iron as you saw in court vitamin E help that old fossils so this is a secondary test that was run so I'm going clear back to 2010 visit when I started researching with his reporting and now three years later we're still funny it the most effective reporting system there is so this young girl you saw the report to begin with on 3 30 of 2010 less than a little over two months definitely less than three months we can see that this raised from 22 up to 38 red run away to optimum here 39 when all the way down to fight we reduce your nutrition and chiropractic tripping because that's what we do 39 point 20 down to 5.8 in wool over 60 days and you can see here Dr Vance kind of sense humor here he has a smiley face if you're not improvement in a frowny face if you didn't so all the greens of where the improvements are and you have to realize every patient is different never get the same thing to every face and has lupus that's that be using drugs you don't do that you find out what they need you give it to them you reevaluate 60 to 90 days later and then adjust the nutrition and your care put into what they need but the red blood cell count better hemoglobin got better and the most impressive thing of all is she went from 99 in her sed rate ESR all the way down to 43 reduced it over half in a little over 60 days would that be 67 days I mean yeah 67 days well that's impossible but it happens every day in what we do in our office and that's what we want to teach you how to do and this girl went into remission she wanted to quit care right thing cuz she felt so much better all the symptoms her lupus was gone and that's what another thing that you can do with this blood test you to say well that's great we have a lot of smiley faces you saw some frowny faces you're in transition it's important when we follow through this until we get almost everything right in there and then we check you I want to do my blood test at least twice a year encourage your patients to do that and keep a regular care well I'm going to turn it over to dr. Merkel nail and I'm going to let him close us right on down we'll be on next month the third Thursday just like always and will be talking about other things that dr. Merkel is going to continue on here on lab testing duck work'll turned over you wow this that was very exciting and the tail I feel like cheering and and that lil that girl's life has been changed and I believe you have saved her life by what you did John and that is absolutely nominal and I know there's kids like that in every community that needs this type of help and then one of the things about the blood work that John was very criminals are phenomenal results all about drugs that she's going to continue to improve but also you can see from as you test them do this that he gets tested regularly that she would she see changes and she'll get worse in the blood before she has physical symptoms so it true you'll see changes in the blood that she's getting worse before she starts to fail and start to have lupus symptoms again boy that is that man i'm gonna jump in here for a second she actually went out of care because she got too cocky how well she felt got married she's also fish you got married and now she started out with symptoms again came back into the office and I'll get those too much as for you she got trashy for over a year and was starting to go back again and then the symptoms started showing up now got her back on the program to get her love about okay yeah a you uh it and thanks down because that that is really what's gonna happen John can you see my screen okay I can't okay all right well i am i am dr. merkel there's there's no picture and i am honored to be able to be speaking you speaking you today and i know we have a lot of time i'm just gonna go ahead and get going and john g see anything wrong with my presentation um go ahead and break and let me know but we're on the second side now the truth about lab tests nutrition and i'm gonna change okay all right let me see if i can if it doesn't change you just tell me don't kingdom every time oh ok you know i forgot to change presenter ok how about how about that you see my screen now i think so your screen go forward let me see that the truth about nutrition here I've got um oh let's see we're having a little technical okay now do you see my screen there I can't tell I'm still in control of it but if you'll just tell me to change i'll change it okay Michael about all right oh okay i know i did there we go there we go i know my screen now hold on just one second let me pull it up here alright guys if down to where I need to be that was very nice though John okay and we're up and running all right there i am and i'm just going to do some briefings about why i believe lab testing is so important and I no insurance rarely pays for lab tests when done by DC but people will pay cash there's somebody as a value my practice has been half cent cash or about the last 20 years I've been doing lab testing and people will pay cash for this and they will pay a lot more than this chiropractors and they will for an adjustment and labs are expensive their discount coops we'll talk about that a little bit in a few minutes here that can provide dramatic discounts and science-based nutrition is a co-op that provides discounts impasses discounts right to doctors to help you better pricing if you happen to live in New York New Jersey of Rhode Island if you have question you can emails but we have ways for you to get special discount pricing for you as well even though you're in a note third-party pay state this is this is phenomenal what you can get now for discounted pricing ok and ok let's back up left it takes on time to do it by hand and I think John shown you how easy it is once you get using a lab testing how much easier it goes lab testing and nutrition most expensive binds one that works and it can always buy a cheap vitamin but buying quality nutrients a--'s is critical and I'm this is what Simon is putting this presentation on for and John's got to experience back to stuff now truth about laboratory testing if you are using nutrition I believe there's greater liability when reading without testing properly a tree what objective testing is really guessing and because I want you one things I that I talked about is becoming a culture authority on health in your community I know dr. brimhall and its Sun and the people are experts in their community and that's what we want for every one of you and your community is be the go-to guy the expert and science-based nutrition is about just that adding science to nutrition practice and you're going to have improved outcomes even with your neuro muscle skeletal patients so let's start with Kevin and ochem dr. brimhall went over case we're going to go over a couple here just give you an idea of why it's so important because here we got Kevin E's got a cholesterol a time for 54 and triglycerides it actually had 36 had a add a little physical done just he went to his doctor medical doctor ran a little lipid panel triglycerides are actually a lipid panel on a CBC found in high closed on my clinic triglyceride and he was recommending take a statin drug but he thought he's a little too young so he came in to see me but he's a little medications yet he drags her torsos and chocolate you know who doesn't like that stuff it's a little decrease of sexual function he's very seen a chiropractor for six months and not really improving very well and his adjustments are holding and he's a little tired so he has increased panic anxiety malaise it changed couple cans of caffeine free coke today it chiropractors you guys who in every all the other practitioners EVS every day in your practice what was his concern is he's a little tired while humming out there is a little bit tired that's what it comes to much he's a little tired and i know most your patients are a little tired but what would you do now to just gave another just winner not my problem just let them just adjustable and take the cholesterol drug well we did a blood test here and dr. brimhall explained very nicely about the red yellow and blue and co and code blue so you have to remember the ranges and your patients like this because they can easily see where the problem areas are blue code blue red is danger yellows warning and if it's white your right knee off from range so you can see the radio and blue then let's get to highlight the cabins blood test you can see his cholesterol SAT for 40 now as triglyceride road for I went that word a hundred are now 28 1450 it is walking heart attack at age 36 how's he feel he's a little tired he's got a creatine kinase someone passes after than 80 remember what creatine kinase says yes it's muscle breakdown but the only feels a little tight this is a very bad test or someone just 36 now I put him on a diet and if we get time I'll show you the diet that's the program I put him on the diet we put him on I show you the list of items we had him on here in just second this is in two thousand and in two week and a two months created time from 731 the 928 is his blood work here's the first blood tests compared to the second one just looked at colors you can see that yeah there's no blue here so that's good you see the grease my face means a value is improving may not be perfect yet but means it's going in the right direction still shows there's a lot of work that needs to be done but overall you've made some changes in some very important areas so let's look the highlights of Kevin those glucose went down them which is which is nice his liver enzymes drop as good as cluster I brought from 440 down to 20 for in two months with no drugs triglycerides drop beautifully he's no longer walking heart attack is creatine kinase drop it is send rate dropped to although this one is dramatic to what dr. Bray malls was but a ck dropped dramatically so now I'm talking to doctors about this well would have been improper outcome with cluster long drugs well how do cholesterol and drugs work in essence they work by making the liver sick and if you make deliver sick it doesn't produce cholesterol because we all know that the lee reduces cholesterol well the key to this guy's problem is right here it's liver enzymes are elevated and here's a little rule which I am which I encourage doctors remember what have you ms q tennessee TN or both red or blue and the OT higher than a PT you need to suspect something more serious going on and I usually like the OT I usually look at that as organ failure and probably sixty-two cents at a time when you see something that's like this with red or blue and yo T side of the PT you have organ failure and like I said about 60 to 70 or more you got hepatitis C and now money you may not know it with your experience but when I saw this and I saw the high triglycerides and the high creatine kinase I thought Hep C i did a Hep C test he's got hepatitis C I refer to the medical doctor so it can be reported to cdc and the patient elected to try to try something natural for a couple months and so that's what he did and these results that he's got and now the thing is if the if he had taken a statin drug and it lowered his cholesterol did the docket you know the doctor really did his job didn't he but the problem is that statin drug is going to cause liver failure within months of not weeks especially as bad as these values are already so the question is how much liver function can you have left and versatile symptoms well the studies show that you can live twenty percent is all you need to be relatively symptom-free twenty percent so by time you have symptoms that's why you have family your friends neighbors that that think they're helping in before you know if they're waiting on liver transplant or they're on dialysis because you don't have symptoms until it is advanced in stage and so twenty percent is all you need to have left before you have symptoms so now we're down to why is the creatine kinase so high that's on because you're right that is muscle breakdown and whenever you see there's you got worried about which kind of muscle that's right the cardiac muscle heart muscle so whenever we see this or no you need to do something with a high creatine kinase a high I mean you just can't say well here take some bottom toca works you need to do something and I'd recommend that they get an EKG now I have an EKG and I'll show you that this trip that I ran on them but at least yeah maybe send to the hunt to his medical doctor let the medic about to run an EKG or you could run the ISIL inside ck mm and be in BB to see if this sea-can his heart but would not be wrong it would not be wrong and for them out because my number one rule is make sure they don't have something they can die quickly from and and so we usher his EKG but why is that creatine kinase too high well you guys probably remember that guy called gaiden and he's got a thought in there that i paraphrased and rephrase and i think i say it i say the concept better than what guy does and and here it is this is my paraphrase of it the body will break down muscle and non-essential tissue to free of nutrients and amino acids for more important function let me say it again so you when you hear it the body will break down muscle and non-essential tissue to free of nutrients and amino acids for more important functions so I tell my patients or ask my patients what's not essential tissue hair skin and nails he sent for a non-essential well they pretty much guessed bad not essential and thank God here is not essential if you look at my picture real close the ice a muscle bone and joints essential or non-essential then they said they realize well you know dick the body will break down well the body will break down muscles what guidance says and non-essential tissue so muscles non-essential bone is nice i saw thought ask you persist in fact a doctor Brujo one of your one of your doctors gave me a line i like i like to use a lot now myself he tells the spatial lots more important your leg bone your leg muscles are your liver and that's what I osteoporosis is the body say those bones in your leg on these important as your liver so it's going to take the minerals out of the bones to preserve liver function or that type of things so muscle bone and joint or non-essential yes convinced you remember this guy is getting adjusted its adjustment or holding are you surprised his adjustments are folding with a ck like that what's more important neck joints or liver neck joints are liver why do you think okay so we got hair skin and nails muscle bone in joints we all know all those are not essential okay let's say what are essential parts well about heart lungs brain kidneys and you can probably throw a couple more in there too but but those things are more essential now I got a big one here for you guys when you think about and I apologize it'll have time to go into great detail missed but hormones are hormones essential or non-essential let me ask you this are you surprised that kevin has a decline in sexual function and sex drive what's more important an erection or your liver alright I know some you guys are laughing out there but really having sex or your liver well truly and here's a little consultation tip for you docs out there well the first sign of poor health in men is a declining sexual function so hopefully that gives you a some ideal which i'm here with kevin and i 10 with kevin's if you were just a chiropractor not doing this type of work and in and he got to fed up with his other chiropractic adjustment more and more not getting better why do you undo you gonna just a more do therapy lasers or decompression is that what Kevin needs what he might need that but it's not going to work until you take care of this important metabolic problem first right that's right so now we've got a nutritional form consent and dr. brimhall has this and and you can read through this this is approved by the ACA by the legal department and basically what this says is a violent is not a drug and essentially says please revise any spirits or some vice if not intensive primary treatment nutritional counseling and buy recommendations is provided solely to a greater quality of foods based diet noticed like the nutrition and support a physiological and biomechanics the human body so every patient signs this so we're not treating their disease I'm not reading is hepatitis or you get to Gideon healthier and you saw the results we've got there's nutrients that he was put on and this was this was again back several years ago and here's the EKG and his EKG showed HR rhythm and these things can I know you probably remember these things I don't remember how to read EKG either but by an interpretive EKG it reads it for you and so and after two months in the first test had all these problems in two months it shows normal ECG is this good evidence based care it sure is this dynamite evidence-based care and yet think some of that creatine kinase that was so extremely high was probably some heart muscle to break it down sure was very nice improvement so nice thing about using the system that we develop science-based nutrition is you know everything about every disease trust me there's people will know a lot more than I do about hepatitis and lupus and cancer in these type of things and we don't know about Kim we don't know about chemistry in fact John Bunnell abhandlungen I am but I've been out over 30 years we now know an exponential amount more biochemistry than we did before it it's impossible for everyone to know the biochemistry in them and define to it that way all we have to do now here's a key people understand the objectivity validity and necessity of blood work and they will pay for it and here's an important point for you for chiropractors people expect real doctors it's order to test their blood when they have real problems real doctors test their patience if you tell your patients they got a problem a real problem better document so if we test properly we know what to test me to promotion to test retest sharp progress where you think will happen see we're gonna treat the patient's these whatever it is well you probably helped the pumps in a testing just like dr. brimhall showed you when he's problems improve the patient would like to get healthier symptoms their disease will improve and we're looking for progress not perfect and just like Kevin is not cured hepatitis clear back to 2000 I believe you're never cured hepatitis this still gets tested twice a year and he's still in remission I since her never cured I just save her information and just like dr. brim halls patient she's always going to have lupus but as long as she follows through and continues to get tested and check she won't have any symptoms of it so most patient bell over the country seeing the disease experts and izzy's expert basically is reduction if they give you a drug to reduce inflammation a drug to reduce your cholesterol drug to reduce your high blood pressure we are the health experts and here's a little quote I like to our little comment thought I want you guys to think of if you get someone healthy enough does it matter the name of the disease they say it's a critical point if you get someone healthy enough doesn't matter if they have lupus or ms or cancer or hepatitis really doesn't does it and so first foundational and foundational is looking for those things that are truly the critical problems the toxic elements that I saw or the hepatitis or the extreme anemia or the or these other things the second is symptom or disease focus and during during the lecturing we do give protocols for infection protocols and how to take a crisis situation down but if you and even adrenals like dr. John dr. brimhall mentioned but if you never fix the foundational problems you're treating the symptoms forever and actually the functional things forever like now if we'd attested Kevin for low adrenals no hormones and logo on transmitters he would have had them and we could treated those things forever and he wouldn't have gotten better because we didn't fix this hepatitis just like and so it's very important remember the interfering functional testing versus foundational testing and so and now and I know we're going to be running short on time but i just want to show you what is possible with this type of concept lady presents in 2007 diagnosis of breast cancer 40 years of ages ladies a beautiful girl trim thin lissa this she exercised the first day every day she eats she is Megan eats organic food and takes a boatload of vitamins already and she gets a mammogram and a diagnosed cancer metastatic cancer from the mammogram it's like that but she comes in immediately to me before she has anything medically done before anything is done and we meet again the blood tests that you've seen and we ran a tumor marker to chy 729 which is the most common tumor marker for breast cancer and nurses 185 it's supposed to be less than 38 now don't look at number tell the cancer metastasized and she started a program within one week before any biopsy chemo radiation surgery or hormone therapy her tumor marker drop 45 points from 185 down to 140 holy count in one week that's what I didn't I didn't know what to expect but that's now this is that we've seen this before many times but I've always thrilled when it happens and within a month a dropped in half and my three months a drop down to 35 less and clinical now and again this is before app will let me go three weeks after she been on our program and it dropped in half chanta lumpectomy I didn't I wouldn't I didn't recommend you get a box they said he'd take it out and leave no she had a lumpectomy and 303 lymph nodes were positive and which I was pretty sure would be radiations you need he recommended a 4-6 weeks follow chemo and was told this year and half probably 8 to 10 years to live attend college thought was pretty good because it was already metastatic can all the lymph nodes that they tested well now she's 48 she's feels great looks great and now the doctor said you got eight to ten years to live really in my world what's the doctor saying and Khalid is saying if you followed my advice based on all my years experience and everybody out I'm treated and seen and done if you followed my advice Nate to ten year you will be dead and so when I saw her the first time here's a question I asked her I said if you've been like chemo and radiation one week just delay one week I'm not saying don't ever do it I say just do it one week will that make any difference in your long-term outcome that's the even answerin colleges that well she gave me a way you can it dropped 45 points now what you ask her now I disabled okay give me a couple more weeks and I've never told to not do chemo radiation but you live and die by that number it as long as the number is good you're good in fact I tell patients not as important how high the number is but the direction it's going as long as it's going down you're winning if it's going up you're losing now that was back in 2007 and her numbers are still good we just and I don't have her most recent on here but she's got nothing recently about 21.2 so that she saw breast cancer yeah she saw his breast cancer but actually if I tested everyone listening for shade 2729 nobody would have a zero because we're all fighting cancer for every day in fact some of you would proud some you win would probably have numbers and the teams and you're still considered non cancer or cause for her total cost in my practice to see me for three months all the labs all the nutrients everything else cost three thousand dollars out of pocket now is that a lot of money it's a bargain in it what would it have cost out of pocket shoot on chemo radiation it's not unusual I see patients before they see me after six months of chemo radiation a half a million dollars where the bills half a million dollars and then what's the copay and I'll akkad stuff on that well more than 3,000 that I like to tell doc because this is a good thumbnail to say you know give me three months three or four months and three thousand dollars and let so we can do and it's amazing how often that we see results like this and so not saying she's cured but also just a little practice a little business tip here how many adjustments would it take you to generate three thousand dollars how much therapy and decompression everything else will they take to generate that this is all cash out of pocket and what was my time involved in this maybe an hour and a half and it for three months and and now she has tested out every couple months and our every about every six months but whenever she feels like she'll run this she'll run his panel or she'll run that tumor marker to see where she's at so I'm perfectly fine with that too okay well here's a blood test you see us a choice of 20 the main question to ask here is if she's doing everything right he could possibly think of why did she get breast cancer well you can see her tumor marker down here 185 she's a little anemic okay her class I was 238 but he ratio was 102 Josh that's great but nothing really major okay early early early diabetic but nothing major so we did a we did a hair test we found just like John did a loop suspicion she's got same color pattern bluest extreme is extreme and she's got extreme high aluminum extreme high cadmium hi Miriam and I platinum and I titanium but we did Adam it dmsa chelation challenge now look carefully here this is just collecting six hours of urine we see a lot of aluminum which correlates with her hair test so a lot of alumina is coming out in a regular hair and a urine but look at this well we use dmsa a key later and a challenge the chelation challenge received three well the high levels of lead we've ever seen till we got extreme high left but notice there's no letter mercury coming out the urine or the hair so here's my theory her loves of toxin were becoming so high in her body commun system was distracted by because of this to the point that she got cancer and distract your immune system there's so much that her body got cancer which goes to how do we take care of people like this if I'd have just thrown more cancer vitamins out or what she have gotten better if we never took care of this I know there's a lot of people on cancer treatment and vitamins air else but if we never took care of this would we ever get this patient better I don't believe stone I believe this is what's going to give us better results than anybody else because we are looking not just to throw nutrients to go to boost immune system but we'll be looking at things to be dragging it down and greatly adversely affecting the immune system I don't have time to teach chelation maybe John will have mian get it I can go over and teach that each guy saw a nice quick and easy chelation protocol that is that we're using our our practice now commercial I tell you what's going to happen you'll run out of time we're going to go ahead next month go as far as you can today may be showing this slide at the end of what we're going to be doing but I think we'll continue on next month and will let's show them that relation is very powerful next month okay we can do that got me to do right to the end of some basic things not yet keep going having fun oh ok ok ok and well here's a new church we put her on the first play the first list of vines we put Iran and her vitamins for two months was about twelve hundred dollars what a bargain I mean this is tremendous and I know his people in your community that would like to know that you doctors can all do everything I'm doing now nothing magical here is this just do it the testing is key you get the test the report would tell you what to do and if again that's a repeat of the other one but I'm going to repeat that thought to get him get a patient healthy not doesn't really matter the name of the disease so here's your that we put Rochelle on oh by the way that layer of breast cancer just showed you if you go to my website 3000 health.com it's like local patient website you can actually go online and I had her as a guest on my radio program I have a radio programming on for 18 18 years ago how it operated radio program and baton at that time and you can actually hear her on the radio talk about her case and we've got other cancer cases and things like that but you have to here to talk about which is pretty cool so here's what we started her on alone and we call this the low-carb program here wouldn't have it some technical difficulties here okay can you hear me ok not there John oh yeah everything fine ok ok i thought we have a little technical difficulties here ok so here we are we must start a low pro card diet Brad Crocker's pasta those type of things and when pastas organic meats and you guys can read through this and get to highlights and what we have is that what we call category one category two in category three now these foods are based on glycemic index glycemic index so now they can eat any of these proteins and then they'll category one that if their own diabetic if they are diabetic insulin or oral medication girl star category one and then their category one if they're 81 c is over 80 d or neg Lucas over 500 but the thing is Ron gonna let them views category 1 for Michelle went breast cancer these and these fruits and vegetables yep eotech try mixing someone online has their Mike Oakland and we're getting a lot of feedback either the people had someone on there as their my coping we're getting a lot of feedback I don't know if they're even listening but you need to be aware that all your noise is coming through so we've got you those are the fruits and here's the vegetables we want people to eat and these are the vegetables so category 1 you can eat those fruits and those vegetables that's all you can eat category2 it's a little easier a lot of times we use the capital that you see the aim one sees a guide or the urinating glucose you see how it's not quite as Extreme now we add foods from category to the fruits and vegetables category 2 and include those are category 1 so we had rochelle and kevin category 1 which is very low carb which take stress off the liver and immune system you're providing nutrients that are very easily digest than absorb and so takes off stress off the system so all of our hepatitis cases cancer case all stock with category one and we try to try to add category 2 as soon as we can then there's category 3 and can you see why the category one dies from work the little car we're going to work to take stress off our the cancer because cancer feeds on sugar I know I'm getting off on some things here here's my standard panel this is what's called the Merkel panel it's got glucose the a1c uric acid Kitty panel electrolytes protein we've got a thorough liver panel serum iron fair to lipid panel power with TSH CBC and differential sed rate CR p ck and vitamin d and just a little clue on this and I apologize for you listeners out there for the extra noise in the background this test with the svn coop price through labcorp i believe is less than one hundred thirty dollars including vitamin d that's less than hundred thirty dollars that is a tremendous value right there because they are truly labs around the country and insurance companies that are being billed over three thousand dollars for this exact same blood test you can get your patients 130 bucks so right there is tremendous value tremendous value and we'll give you some other things on that per minute here there's some quick reference guide talking what's the limit or just a couple things he really good okay just a second I would like to add a couple things with people out there if they're not used to doing this renew if they are they're doing it by hand everything you have showed us comes in the original report like the dietary theme do want to buy an extra book or anything this comes out where you read it something you give it to your patients and all that is already there so that was a real benefit to me when I first started to get into this guy didn't do I didn't do blood because I was an AK guy and and I didn't see any reason to point out self and patient with AK that nobody was helping from the hospital but then I found out how could I prove what I've done until I started putting this together with what we already do and so when you get the reporting in two things I want to bring out number one the blood testing comes along with this program and number two when you get the program and the report comes to you all this information is there you don't have to go hiking back or type it in yourself it comes there so that was a major benefit for me so go ahead and try to me an edge on the end and I appreciate that and that is true these reports you're looking at are completely computer-generated and I don't have a report in front of maybe you can download a copy at the brimhall advantage com a sample report and you'll see that it's it's got the most comprehensive thorough report because it incorporates the blood the hair the medications are on because the medications affect their labs and it takes that consideration their symptoms and it puts it on to a thorough comprehensive unique report and it did it will provide dietary recommendations as well as specific client recommendations and a beauty of what dr. brimhall has done for you as he has brought in simonton and the bioenergy x line so your report will print out exactly the nutrients that that patient needs not just the name of the product but dr. John has gone in and worked with us so it can pronounce the shack osas the number of phil's you need to take will be printed out on a report so it's a beautiful thing so don't think I know all this blood work you get started the report will explain it to you and you learn as you go your patients are have the luxury of waiting till you tell you think you know it all and I got here a quick reference guide and you skew uric acid is low or if you're not familiar with you again with these things you might be confused okay what's here between a creatinine and a creatine kinase well this year goes in creatine creatine it's low hit me low protein or those things which I could be kidney it's such a quick reference guide us all I've got for you here I mean that's all I'm showing you now one of the things about this these couple slides that one make very clear see the protein deficiency here there's a lot of things here associated protein deficiency as well as chronic fatigue now what do most doctors know about crying fatigue or do for well not much but would you think if your liver sick and is causing chronic fatigue that if you get the liver well or you get these blood values improve you think that's going to help crying 42 well sure it will now protein deficiency if you just cruise through you see a lot of protein deficiencies showing up here I believe that this is an epidemic of unparalleled proportions in our society today because of one drug that people take so routinely and with almost without thought it's a little purple pill your prilosec prevacid those type of things your proton pump inhibitors introduce your stomach acid if you reduce stomach acid you absolutely cannot digest protein efficiently and that will lead in fact you start doing lab work like like I've been doing for many many years you'll see people in that purple pill they got low protein they have local protein they're going to have without look without protein you're going to get you're going to develop anemia you need protein for it blood cells hemoglobin you're going to have low thyroid you have low liver function you have low albumen globulin you'll have yellow your gas of low creatine kinase all because that low purple pill start you on a state of malnutrition and that's why it's very important that you look at everything and see what's going on in the distal tip chloride is one of the primary indicators if you're low and hydrochloric acid on your blood tests you chloride here if you're low and chloride your body can't make hydrochloric acid so if c chloride on the blood test you need hydrochloric acid but if you see high chloride then you need other digestive enzymes and that's one thing that dr. brimhall is bringing to you is that solution is going to print out on your report okay so well I'm god I don't time go through all this but how do we analyze the blood okay they are truly millions of blood tests being done there's hundreds of elements of test it's 50 key elements and in a specific test like you might run a hormone panel or our cancer marker or or some other thing like that and uh so we start with that now we're going to start with a single blood test well let's say let's say you got a lower blood count you got anemia what does one blood test by itself tell you know not much does it doesn't tell you why but suppose you got a name yet lower blood count and your liver sick can the sick lever cause anemia yes it can how about stick kidneys can sit Kitty's causing it sure it can so you see the more testing we do we're going to see why maybe that's causing now we're going to look at drugs drug side effects and drugs are on if people are on well if they're on any drugs cadet cause anemia well sure it can because the drugs have to be limiting our neutralized by the liver and eliminated through the kidneys mostly and so virtually anyone until any drugs at all you'll find that they're yellow mom we anemic and the more drugs more they go on the more nemeth they're going to be and so that will be a factor now additional additional things we also looking on this is lifestyle things drug side effects and in addition a lifestyle suppose that they drink supposed to strict vagin are you surprised that they're anemic or they drink six cans of coke a day are you surprised to niemiec sure so anyway and once you get all that information what one blood test means and all the other objective data you look at all their subjective findings all their lifestyle and drugs are on you'll put a diagnosis and treatment and so and here's what we're going through everything that's red yellow or blue on your report is going to be covered in the actual verbiage of the report and it's going to show all the supporting test it's going to list them they're all the positive findings that that patient has is going to be on that report and when you read here you go when you read you'll see that it's going to it's going to put the associate vice the medications and lifestyle that could contribute toward that anemia and then you know put a diagnosis and treatment so here's this nice line which says can you see that if the reports going to look at okay the sed rate associated values is supporting my lifestyle things like that and diagnosis the arsenic but can you see if you if you only do half of this too i'm gonna say the patient may not do all testing merkel recommends just to do half of it you're going to miss half the information you need to make it thorough evaluation so don't try don't you know don't create a problem for yourself right in the beginning by not doing the testing that's required and if you do a testing properly and because of testing is so expensive it's always better to do all the testing right up front and do a piece at a time and but here's some cute testing you should be doing and I'm going to roll through this we have time for questions and if you have slow response to the muscle treatment and I just got swear of things on here you might if your patients aren't responding aren't healing you know aren't holding adjustments that maybe there's other factors you're not aware of like diabetes I guarantee you're paid there are patients in your chiropractic practice right now full-blown diabetic and nobody knows it I can also guarantee that there's some people have hepatitis and they don't know it I don't have time go over hepatitis and detail here and I'll bet they have kidney disease too because you remember how much liver and kidney function can be left and have no symptoms twenty percent so guaranteed you have these people in your practice they don't know but you don't know either cuz you're not testing right thyroid all these are things and through here here's the sample report that you get again I don't have time to go over all this but you can I know you can download a sample report and the brimhall advantage com and you can read through that study it and that's the type of report you're going to get for every one of your patients now I'm just going I'm going to end up with this case here just a normal guy it's going to just show you how important this is this guy did not want to come in he's got high blood pressure high cholesterol a little indigestion a little ed and although little reptile dysfunction air a little model fatigue neck stiffness and headaches he's on aspirin he's on a statin drug lisinopril his medical doctor says you're just getting old and all of his buddies I've got the same thing he says I'm just normal and doesn't so wise in my office and well his wife had a serious very serious health problem two years before I came and I'm not go over a case but she decided that her husband and her son needed tested and so after I went through the consultation i said well wendy do some testing said wait a minute I've gotta get all the testing done of my wife did I said what she had a lot of testing that cause she had a serious promise if you know my wife said I gotta get testing done it's saying that she didn't I smell okay yeah it's gonna cost you twelve hundred dollars he said yeah my son too well you know if the wife says that her husband and her son are going good testify she did you know what's going to happen they're going to get tested so twelve hundred dollars for each now he didn't think he's got a problem he's normal but we did the testing there there's some things we don't know her we didn't do in him but we did that what I do almost every one of my patients we did a hair test and we did a blood test and now in the hair test TC the high uranium like dr. brimhall found now we generally don't have as much toxicity like rim ha does out there like dr. brimhall does in Arizona and Utah things but when you have some people you have some minimal levels bigos got high copper what's a disease of high copper Wilson's disease can Wilson disease cause fatigue high blood pressure yeah 10 both things he's got where you get high copper oftentimes water pipes so why is this guy need he needs a water filter how hard is that now you can't see down here and but he's got and it's on the air to slide he's got low vitamin D yeah it's not on there he's got extreme low code blue low vitamin D now can you guys help low vitamin D yeah it's pretty easy but can low vitamin D cause high blood pressure high cholesterol ed whole boatload of chronic fatigue every one of those things cannon and for about forty dollars a year you provide 5000 action units today a vitamin D that's easy if you look going up he's got high farrington and a high hemoglobin he's got hemochromatosis was this guy need to do in easton Tony blood but can he can he macro mitosis cause high blood pressure Edie crying fatigue absolutely so you felt this guy probably eight percent by getting him a water filter vitamin D and donating blood uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh was it now he's got elevated liver enzymes why are his liver enzymes elevated right because it's on a statin drug and a blood-pressure drug exactly so there's some other things which chief review on that now we also did the chelation test his wife had done it and I do this test on about eighty percent of all of my new patients and it is amazing what we always find and I'm sure John's find the same thing I know his son is and that type of thing but on it on just regular urine just collecting six as urine nothing shows up but now we use dmsa holy cow he's loaded there's let him agree that it's not coming out we have to use a key later to help pull it out let's go back look the hair there's only tiny bit of lead coming out and really no significant mercury at all so so could higher and higher lumps of lead and mercury going into a system cause high blood pressure high cholesterol crime fatigue and welcomes your LED sure Ken and so by this how easy is going to be done if you test properly the reports gonna come out and show boom there it is he's got high lead and mercury that's not coming out you're gonna look to hear both there it is right there easy oh he's got low fine and I wish had got that code blue low vitamin D shot for you so that's easy and donating blood that's easy I would bet and probably have if not maybe sixty or seventy percent your patients just like dr. brim halls lube was patient was easy once you test properly and that's how even most difficult ones Rochelle with with metastatic breast cancer was easy once I tested properly and that's why your practice going to be too now if you did just functional testing if you did just a saliva and urine in that type of thing you'd think that herb the guy we just saw had all that high blood pressure and high cholesterol and Ed not do you think he probably had low testosterone and he had low adrenals and low neurotransmitter lo fatty acids all these things well sure he did but sure he had all that but which came first by copper or the low testosterone the low vitamin D or the low growth hormone what do you think sure you guys all know the foundational testing that I just showed you the hair the blood that we did and the chelation challenge is came first and you can treat the adrenals forever you can do testosterone and you know what the patient's going to get worse so you be a better doctor we routinely get people up testosterone we routinely get people up these magnetic hormones and things like that because I always know that there's something deeper going on so I tell you just that to revolutionize your practice right there so John I'm going to roll over and some things I want to show you some things here if you guys want to get started on this dr. brimhall and I are working together and the normal cost to join science-based nutrition is 499 and some things dr. Benoit was doing he were providing a discount and he sign up under dr. brimhall with science-based nutrition for 399 and even get some tremendous benefits first of all you can get everything that this science-based nutrition provides on your basic online support you're gonna get the reports you're going to get online training all SB and training and education lectures are available online we have video to show you how to do patient entry how to answer the phone we've got we've got online training videos on everything you need to do we've got on how to report it you've got you automatic the color coded report you see and some other things that science-based nutrition does we provide newsletters every month we provide a newsletter based with nutritional orientation to start to build your nutrition practice and these are all these are all researched supported and your own basically they're all basically topically based so in your materials you're going to get a newsletter for prostate and there's a whole that's going to be in your system that are topically oriented you'll see breasts can see oh see prostate you'll see some things on water all these different things but you don't get a new one each month automatically and there's also newsletter you're going to get from science-based nutrition that's going to insert some doctor questions or some other things like that and all very good and that's only 39 I mean that that is that's a bargain i got take you guys everybody listening should sign up with that because if nothing else 399 the discounts you will get with the co-op pricing for the labs and for the blood and the hair is going to be a greater discount if you became dr. brimhall station are my patient guarantee i'm going to charge you normal what a normal rate for all that but for 399 the pricing is just phenomenal illness to get you going and well let's give it an example a normal blood test from a lap would be about fifteen hundred dollars and like you said those are going to run just the blood alone i'm going to say about 150 if you add everything you need to do and then how much does a hair analysis approximately knock the hair test again you get discounted pricing through doctors data the the normal hair tests or doctor's day is $55 and you can get it for as low as $45 through science-based nutrition so instead of 55 i know some some people worried well they're going to get higher rates that you go through us to know you're going to get lower rates because we bring the coop pricing drag me to you so you get discounted price england when you sign up a science-based nutrition sighs just fifty five dollars for a hair test excuse me 45 value get it for $45 rather than 55 if you go directly through doctors data and we've got a same pricing on all that stuff so let's say this is me hai jaan and say for a hundred and eighty dollars a patient you get the comprehensive or blood test and the hair test now for one hundred eighty dollars they get all that we charge our patient five hundred and fifty dollars for for all the testing and the report and us which includes all the vitamins a diet everything else it includes are going and that includes us going over with them five hundred fifty dollars I've already charged in 120 hours my console so 120 dollars plus 5 50 take a hundred eighty out of that the rest goes in your pocket 180 are your lab costs on that now we got some doctors out on the East Coast and West Coast and maybe where dr. Grimm halls at your cost of living tires in Dayton Ohio I wouldn't doubt it a lot of doctors on the coast charge around seven hundred dollars and that's fine I know the highest doctor I think charts about twelve hundred dollars but remember your cost 180 we've got a doctor in Chicago who is just called gangbusters and he charges 380 he just doubles what his expense I is a hundred and sixty eight hundred 680 he charges 384 that doubles it and he says I'm gonna make my money on vitamin sales and if 380 everybody can afford that trust me arabe can afford throw an 80 bucks for this and get that type of reporting this is just an absolute steal for this and now having been now getting it in a hundred dollars cheaper and now you get the specific signage in and bio interjects products and then these things aren't new these are things that dr. brimhall is son another brim opera bikes have been using for some time to work with it so it might be new you but they've been doing this and working this for quite some time so I'm very excited to be able to bring this to you and there's some numbers you call Jason for him off seminars now here's an SB a member and actually dr. brimhall this is one of your doctors made his comment to its knees Bend has to be a member for four years who asked how hard loves whoops link back up to that this pretty quote that's how hard it was to incorporate lab work into his practice he used to do a lot of muscle testing and he said he has to work more and longer hours because he is now scheduled full for new nutrition patients to two months in advance is cheap coach that is nice become adults page that the knee pain is less important than your liver kidneys and that the body can live without a knee but I he'd just patience lesson and has better results because he's taking care of the primary problem first who's been practiced 12 years now this is dr. there's no outside marketing all this practice is in internal market we have internal marketing things but this guy is phenomenal how tall you doctor thought they left out of practice that is two months wait to see you that would be pretty cool he started out of cash as well he's a he's a total cash practice he's never been anything but cash and I will say this is not your son know if I'm Trina who did but you know it is but this is not your son your son single second of it is and he's he's been a breakfast eight years of my son and he and it's kind of nice he's doing this type of work and so it is it is just very exciting it's not just dr. bring hall or me doing it or his son but there's a lot of doctors that dr. bring walls training and now using this is getting some very nice shoes also find out more about that you can use the brimhall advantage go to brinlaw been calm and I've got the couple things how I show you all right here it's going to print out your nutrients exactly what Simon gin and dr. brimhall you probably recognize these products here I ran I ran a sample report and i want to show these products you just got in the system here that this is the benefit of what your doctors are going to see when they want to use science-based nutrition the actual product and how many exactly how many per day that they're going to need now remember this patient was really bad there's a lot of nutrients practice but the number of nutrients don't reflect how about the patient is I got the form here that you will that you can download from the brimhall bank com website all you do you you're going to fill this in and for 399 you're going to get all this stuff and you can read it and again it's a complete you're going to get you're going to get everything you need to use to get started and you don't get insights for complicated cases you're going to get back up for tough cases the nice thing about I can tell you the brimhall science based in church and bandage as your give dr. brim all backing you up and I'm going to be available to if needed by your room get all the the reports are true there is no one has got better reports this is a patented system and no one's got reports anywhere near as advanced and comprehensive and thorough Zaher Zaher and we're going to continue to train you their online training for your doctors for your staff it's online it's at our website for if you get new staff to Center for the computer and there to learn everything they need to know to get this going and again dr. brimhall has support staff but we've got our own science-based nutrition staff that I help you with weather problems you got with labs obtaining labs finding a draw station year area or any little detail like that we got great staff to help you with that I like this thing brimhall advantage is bring it all together and I think with his experience with science-based nutrition enzyme June he's got a great combination here so dr. brimhall I'd like to take you Imogen for bring this together I look forward to work with you and future lectures and in training your doctors to do is type work to help your patients more because that's what we want we're all here for to help patients feel better thank you dr. grandma well thank you i really appreciate you being on we'd have run out of time you guys put on your calendar the last weekend in january going to be in phoenix arizona for dr. merkel and dr. singer and dr. brett myself along with others are going to be teaching this in great detail who will have dr. Merck alone again he did pretty good today so we might give him a month break and we'll have him right back here the next month or two and go over some other reporting so i'm going to say goodnight god bless you all and we look forward to join the grim advantage and take advantage of like we have taken me years to get dr. van do this he doesn't have to discount but I I'm kind of a", "jaXk1Wtmgqc": "oh how I have been wanting to take a look at this one this is from hype city vapors this is their apple pie in case you aren't on Instagram hype City vapors is rated the number one trending eliquid of 2018 I call [ __ ] Big Time [ __ ] on that one but this company hype City vapors what they do is they look for people that are like desperate to get a sponsor on Instagram and they say you know they do all this robot comment stuff on people's posts and try to get them to message them so that they can sponsor them sponsor what they offer is a 25% off code and you know I disagree with a lot of things that are happening here first of all if you're gonna be a like if you have a sponsor you don't pay for the stuff typically that's that's how it usually works I mean sponsor we're not talking about like discount code everybody has discount codes this stuff anyways I don't want to get on the long rant about the company I don't agree with their business practices however I do respect the hustle because they [ __ ] found a target market and have capitalized on it so apple pie we got the [ __ ] monopoly man there that's awesome right we love that we do have the warning so they are doing some stuff right I guess this is a hundred ml bottle chubby gorilla bottle the price on it I think was like $25 but I did use somebody's sponsor code their personal sponsor code which was like VIP hype or something like that hype VIP I got this stuff dripped on I just reworked this Apocalypse v2 fuse Clapton's in there they are a 0.15 build sitting at a hundred watts number one trending juice I don't know if you can remember any juices that came out in twenty thousand 2018 and there's quite a few really good ones so they're just kind of making [ __ ] up as they go whatever so the flavor obviously apple pie I mean we're gonna expect cinnamon apples pie some possible brown sugar or whatever all that kind of stuff I'm not gonna read the description actually let's read the description let's see what kind of stupid [ __ ] they say so apple pie is described as an old-fashioned apple pie with crisp apple slices and sugary graham cracker crust that's all it says when I'm inhaling there's like a slight like I feel it a tingle on the back of my throat so I'm guessing that's from the cinnamon that they already been listing in their flavor description this juice on a scale of one to ten if I had to put it I would give it like a - yeah like a - two and a half maybe this is not for dramatic effect I'm just giving you what I feel about it I mean I dislike the company I will be honest with you about that because I don't like all that robot [ __ ] cancerous [ __ ] that they do but I'm still gonna try to take an objective look at the juice it's not very good I don't really taste any Apple if I bake this without thinking about apple pie and was just uh you know what do you taste kind of thing if I can get over that weird slight sting in the back of my throat I would never be able to pick out apple pie for this ever hell my scale of trash okay and good this justifies 100% trash so yes monopoly man do not pass go do not collect $200 that's what I got for you on hype City vapors apple pie have a good day", "2y3EylDicaw": "students this is your facilitated dr. Johnny share and today we are going to discuss the importance of diet we carbohydrates and glycemic index now before starting this important topic what you need to understand here is that it is not not only going to help you in passing your semester exam but it will also help in your professional life as well you will and today from today's discussion you will understand that what actually what the dietary components are carbohydrate about carbohydrates are actually are and what their importance is in the diet and how they contribute in in any disease and you are also going to understand the glycemic index that's the most important thing as far as the management of diabetes mellitus is concerned you will know the foods that are low glycemic index that have and that have high glycemic index now the learning objectives for today's discussion is to identify the basic food sources of the major carbohydrates the monosaccharides disaccharides polysaccharides and fiber what are these and in which food item these mono die and polysaccharides are actually present then at the end of the lecture you would be able to list the functions of carbohydrates in the body describe the regulation of blood glucose how the blood glucose is being regulated and which factors contribute in increasing the blood glucose and which factors contribute in decreasing the blood of course outline the beneficial effects of fibers on the body that fiber is really important as far as health is concerned so you will be able to are you will be outlining the beneficial effects of fiber at the party then you will be able to state the recommended dietary laws for carbureted how much carbohydrate should be taken in a diet per day and explained the glycemic index and glycemic load at the end so these are some of the learning objectives we'll be discussing today now to start with the balanced human diet includes all the major macromolecules the proteins carbohydrates fats and the micronutrients like minerals and vitamins now as we are going to discuss carbohydrates we'll be discussing what are the major components of carbohydrates and which food item contains these carbohydrates now approximately a normal adult who weighs approximately 70 kilograms he he requires approximately 2200 kilocalories out of which approximately 50 to 55 percent of his normal die should contain carbohydrates it comes from the food item that contains carbohydrates then 30% should be from the fat and 50 20% from G proteins the G is this is basically recommended proportion of energy supply that a proportion of carbohydrate in your diet should be approximately 50 to 55 percent in a normal condition the source of carbohydrates we can classify this sources of carbohydrates into more no dye and polysaccharides polysaccharides are also known as complex carbohydrates the complex carbohydrates are basically stars and hydrogen the monosaccharides we have is glucose fructose and galactose we get Mauro cigarette to push short and galactose and from various food items and then we have disaccharides like maltose lactose and sucrose as from your previous knowledge you will be recognizing that maltose is basically a disaccharide that is made up of two glucose residues lactose is a disaccharide which is actually present in milk and contains two group two monosaccharides restituted is glucose and galactose and we have suppose which is comes from the table sugar and again is a disaccharide it is made up of a glucose and fructose then we have a polysaccharide it is we can have a milos on Milo packed and glycogen and stars like in stars these are the complex carbohydrates are usually present in our normal diet consequence now a general function is the carbohydrate a carbohydrate it can provide loads and loads of energy a carbohydrate most of the carbohydrates like all the polysaccharides all other monosaccharides like fructose galactose they all are converted into glucose and then glucose goes into a metabolism pathway a metabolic pathway that is glycolysis in which the glucose is broken down and then it forms pyruvate in the pyruvate goes further into the TCA cycle by forming in acetyl CoA and then it is being it provides a loads and loads of energy so it provides energy approximately one mole of glucose synthesizes 38 moles of ATP now if we see that how much carbohydrate actually it actually synthesize approximately 4 kilocalories of energy per gram of carbohydrate the non-essential amino acids the non-essential amino acids which are actually being synthesized they can also synthesize carbohydrates within our body through their carbon skeleton so they also basically there they not only provide they cannot they can and they not only synthesize carbohydrate for day you know they can also be synthesized in the body as well so the carbohydrates the non-essential amino acids they are synthesized from the carbon skeletons and if you remember the structure of an amino acid amino acid it has a central carbon to which on one side we have a carboxylic group to the other side we have the amino group so if you remove the amino group which what is left behind is a carbon skeleton dead carbon skeleton is basically comes from the intermediate metabolites of glucose metabolism that intermediate metabolites it is the metabolites of TCA cycle the pyruvate itself so they can be converted they can easily be converted into essential amino acid by simply addition of the amino group and then we have fat the carbohydrates can synthesize fat acetyl co a fee if we eat an excess of energy the acetyl co a the excess of acetyl co a will be synthesized the TCA cycle will be overwhelmed and instead of going into the TCA cycle the acetyl co a will synthesize fatty acids and they shall go away from the mitochondria inside the mitochondria goes out of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm through citrate shuttle and then it synthesizes fatty acids and carbohydrate it can form it can be stored in the form of glycogen and the major storage site for glycogen is liver and muscles so we have two types of glycogen storage sites we can a we can store glycogen in liver and the other side is muscles but what you need to remember here that liver glycogen is the only glycogen that can maintains a blood glucose concentration whereas the muscle glycogen is only meant for its own energy needs during muscular contractions and it cannot maintain the blood glucose because the lack of the enzyme and it affects the tiniest I'm sorry enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme that breaks down the glucose 6-phosphate into focus so the enzyme deficient and muscle tissue is glucose-6-phosphatase in same then we have a TCA cycle intermediates as yeah all we talked about that they know essential amino acids which are being synthesized from the TCA cycle intermediates they also are synthesized from the glucose restitute that is carbohydrates then in nucleotides the nucleotides the sugar push on the nucleotide that is the ribose and deoxyribose sugars they also are synthesized from and these carbohydrates then we have glycoprotein proteins bind it with the with the carbohydrate residue different carbon residues it can bind the glucose galactose and they have diverse functions in the body then we have glycol lipids again like Oh lipids they also be synthesized by addition of carbohydrate to the lipids so they are various functional carbohydrates it can provide energy it can synthesize a minor acid which can synthesize fat guy cogent thesis I can intermediates nucleotides it is a building blocks of nucleic is like RNA and DNA then the glycoproteins and glycolipids they also are weak synthesized from key carbohydrates now when we see the overview of metabolism as you can see here the we have the TCA cycle the citric acid cycle which breaks down the acetyl CoA are two carbon compound acetyl co enters into the TCA cycle and it forms the NADH and the NADH captures a chemical energy in the form of hydrogen's four protons and then these reducing equivalent like nadh and fadh2 reasoner g2 the electron transport chain and the electron transport chain accepts the protons and electrons and then it forms the energy through the electron transport chain now this acetyl CoA is basically the common intermediate metabolite which is being contributed not only by the carbohydrate but also it is contributed by the amino acids in the fatty acids as well as you can see here the polysaccharide which we normally take in our diet the complex carbohydrates like starch which are actually present in our food items like rice roti chapati so they have been broken down by digestion absorption provides provides monosaccharides the monosaccharides goes into glycolysis a false pyruvate pyruvate forest elf way and then it provides energy to the dedicated cycle and electron transport chain yesterday I would also want be routed by beat oxidation of fatty acids the fatty acids are being oxidized by beta oxidation broken down and then it provides loads and loads of energy to formation of a similarly proteins after digestion absorption there these free amino acids and interesting cookie metabolic semi-minor axes are deaminated the amino group is being released and the ammonia is being excreted in the form of urea through urea cycle whereas the carbon skeletons of the amino acids contribute to the formation of acetyl co a and then again this tell Co it goes into the TCA cycle provides energy and the electron transport chain so acetyl co a is the common intermediate metabolite which is being synthesized from all the three major macromolecules the lipids polysaccharides and proteins now now the the major coil here is it can we restrict carbohydrate from tight absolutely can we only live on on fatty acids [Music] and the proteins only is it really healthy what do you think is it very healthy if we totally cut off carbohydrates from our diet just think about it it's basically it's not healthy if we if we totally completely destroyed carbohydrate from that is not absolutely healthy it's really very injurious to the hell because many many tissues are only dependent on carbohydrate oxidation only on on carbon oxidation for its energy needs let us take an example of such issues for example the red blood cells for example the brain tissue it's only dependent on glucose oxidation for its energy needs however when we totally restrict carbohydrate from our diet what happens actually the the the body goes into a stressful condition in which the in which the fatty acids and amino acids will be broken down to provide glucose and it the body will start synthesizing glucose through gluconeogenesis that is for the formation of glucose from the non carbohydrate precursor so that it can provide the glucose to the tissues which are only dependent on the course for its energy needs so it really start looking at genesis the minor acids will start will be broken down and provide glucose on the other hand the fatty acids are been broken down to form acetyl co a that will provide energy to the gluconeogenesis at the end and meanwhile the fatty acid will also form ketone bodies and there will be ketoacidosis so they are various complications that can that can be caused by a by if we totally restrict carbohydrate from our diet so it's really not II to completely restrict carbohydrate from r-type now the blood glucose regulation now we talk about the blood glucose regulation there are it is being regulated by certain factors there is a balance between factors that increases a blood glucose concentration and and there are factors that that decreases of course concentrations is we have two factors which actually helps in deregulation blood glucose now Before we jump to the discussion how it is being regulated there are what we need to understand the levels of blood glucose concentrations in different states in the post-absorptive state yet after we have been dead approximately have a two to four harvests of taking a diet the blood glucose concentration is a proxy is maintained between 80 milligrams to 100 milligrams per day that is a normal blood glucose concentration in which the food items the died is being digested and absorbed and after four to four hours the body is maintaining the blood goes concentration between eighty many times whatever I gathered is a normal force concentration now when we take a carbohydrate rich meal just before after taking our average made a blood glucose concentration may rise to 120 to 130 milligrams per DL the third condition we have is in starvation it may falls during starvation approximately salvation from works of approximately to 14 to 16 hours or 12 hours it may fall be 16 milligrams to 70 milligrams per DL now watching what you need to remember here that the blood glucose concentration has been maintained within a very narrow limits if you see in the Buddha blood was said between 80 200 120 to 130 in a carbide after taking a rubber rashmi and starvation between 60 20 milligrams so the body is trying to maintain a blood glucose concentration in a very narrow range and certain hormones and certain organs helps in the maintainer protocol circulation the two most important hormones which helps in the blood glucose regulation they are insulin and glucagon whereas other hormones are also there for example Google corticoids or growth hormone they also helps in the proposed regulation for example the glucocorticoid and growth hormone increases during a starvation and it causes gluconeogenesis and causes the breakdown of a minor acid and provides more and more focus so the body here is trying to maintain the Protocol's concentration in a very narrow limits and this is only happens in a normal normal adult now as the blood glucose concentration goes below 16 milligrams we can say that the that the individual is having hypoglycemia so if the blood glucose concentration decreases below 60 milligrams per DL we can mark that individual as hypoglycemia where a normal range is approximately some books right it is from 60 to 90 is you basically 8200 so it's all correct you may find different ranges in different books now as the blood glucose concentration below 16 there will be some science into hypoglycemia that is neurological science that is hunger release of because of the release of glucagon epinephrine cortisol sorting and cramping will be accompanied with the hypoglycemia then if the lubos concentration goes below 40 this is severe hypoglycemia and there will be sinus symptoms of lethargy convulsions and coma if this hypoglycemia is not treated it may lead to permanent brain damage and death so in a normal individual it is it is not possible that a blood glucose concentration goes below 60 milligrams per DL this can only happen if someone is having if having some long-standing conditions for died or someone is diabetic who is on hypoglycemic drugs for example some individuals some some patients who are on insulin if they skip the meal the blood glucose concentration rapidly goes down below 60 milligrams going into a hypoglycemic attack because of because they have they have not taken their mean and they are on insulin treatment so in this condition there may be higher chances of hypoglycemia but this hypoglycemia is not possible in a normal third factors affecting glucose concentration so there are factors which helps in the addition and blood for example absorption from the GI T helps in increasing the blood glucose concentration hepatic glycogen or lysis it is breakdown of glycogen which is the storage form of carbohydrate it helps in increasing the blood glucose gluconeogenesis there is a formation of new blue course from non carbohydrate precursors like from black 8 pyruvate and a minor assets then glucose obtained by other sources can increase the profitable and venial reabsorption they are other factor that increases the blood glucose concentration now this is maintained by factors that removes the glucose from the blood the factors that remove the blood from that removes the glucose from blood they are hepatic like Genesis that is the formation of glycogen it is the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver and vessels then glycogenesis and muscles as well lipogenesis it is formation of lipids then oxidation of carbohydrates that is oxidation capital that is the glycolysis in the TCA cycle then synthesis of non-essential amino acids can also remove glucose from blood and other compounds chances of other component like glycoproteins and glycolipids these are factor that removes that glucose from the blood so we have two factors which is being which maintains a blood glucose concentration now the majors organ that control the blood glucose level so my query here is that name that organ that control the blood glucose level the major organ however various organs are involved but just think about the major organ which helps in the control of the blood glucose level now so the major organ that maintains the blood goes concentration is liver liver is know is also known as a glucose star just like a thermostat of your air condition the liver is a glucose tag of your body that maintains the blood glucose concentration because it plays an important role all the metabolic pathways related with carbohydrate metabolism is taking place within the hepatocytes like glycogen breakdown glycogen synthesis then how they how it is being stored heart is being released all these major metabolisms are taking place in the liver now just to sum up that how it plays an important to how the liver plays an important role of glucose stat how it maintains a blood glucose concentration we take a diet the diet after taking a diet in the gut has been digested absorbed the monosaccharides and the the polysaccharide have been broken down into monosaccharides and then it goes into the liver through the hepatic portal vein it goes into the liver the excess of carbohydrates are stored in the liver as glycogen whereas the excess of whereas the other carbohydrates are goes into the theraphy and the carbohydrates can synthesize amino acids and there is a poor of blood glucose which is being maintained within the narrow limit of 8200 Mary Caspar Diaz is a normal range is a normal range of bread glucose concentration in a normal healthy adult it is ranges from 80 200 milligrams per DL now this can be regulated by various factors for example this blood glucose can be taken up and consumed by muscles it can be consumed by glands and other tissues it can provide glucose to the brain which is only dependent on glucose oxidation force energy needs and fat itself can utilize this glucose and it can form it can synthesize glycerol and then it goes back to the liver and the reversible reactions can occur and whereas kidneys can also reabsorb glucose or if the blood glucose concentration thisis above 180 milligrams it it can go and it can be sued out in the UD so you read blood glucose only present if eating everything theses arenas you sold for glucose if what you need to remember here the renal threshold of glucose here is by eighty milligrams per DL if the blood glucose concentration increases above 180 when he comes for a deal the the glucose will comes into the hearing before 180 milligrams all the glucose is being reabsorbed and conserved so this is a very narrow limit which is being maintained now liver is at my co-star that helps in maintaining the blood glucose concentration then we have low blood glucose concentration the liver glycogen will be broken down and provides glucose as it's used it can maintain the bread glucose whenever we have high blood glucose concentration the liver will capture excess of glucose and excess as glucose will be forming a glycogen that will be present in the liver so it will be the bread of course concentration okay now so we have two conditions of liver it can become lipo Jenna and we have excess of glucose and just after taking a carbohydrate rich meal the liver will capture more and more glucose and because of the influence of the insulin it will it will synthesize triglyceride it will synthesize glycogen and there will be active glycolysis for the energy purpose so it becomes lipogenesis becomes life which i nag it will form triglycerides Tryg aside that can be deposited in the fat tissue so it becomes life with genic whenever we have is when we have when the body goes into the starvation when we have low blood glucose concentration the liver will become blue cogenitor it will instead of synthesizing triglycerides or forming glycogen the liver will start providing glucose just use the glycogen will be broken down sequentially and provide Moro saccharides glucose residues because of the influence of glucagon epinephrine cortisol the glycogen will be degraded and they will also be a complete with gluconeogenesis the non-essential amino acid will be broken down to form of glucose so in this way in starvation the liver will become glucose and so there are two states of liver it can become life with genic and can become glucose actually in this way the liver can maintain the blood glucose concentration it is a glucose part of a body and it plays an important role and maintaining to the proposed concentration now the fate of the diet carbohydrate a diet Heydrich the fate of the ID carbohydrate or carbohydrate can provide ATP it can be oxidized degraded into lactate through anaerobic glycolysis and the major source of Arabic like Allah says is is metabolism which is been going on in red blood cells and it's character muscles during students exercises then we have the carbohydrate can be stored in the form of glycogen or it can form free fatty acids or the it can contribute the formation of triglyceride formation so the type II carbohydrate can we have four fates it can provide energy it can from lactate glycogen and free fatty acids now glucose synthesis during starvation now it's very important as far as this salvation is concerned and in this it is being this this discussion is basically you can understand by using a plot between glucose oxidation on the y-axis and the time the hours in on the x axis now we have what we are going to do is we are going to plot a a graph between the glucose which is being oxidized and on the y-axis and heat timing in hours the eight hours 16 hours 20 hour 24 hours and approximately after one day we have two days a day 16 day that is a starvation of spaces now what happens when we take a carbohydrate rich meal in the fed state when we take a carbohydrate rich meal the blood glucose concentration rapidly increases and most of the glucose which is being oxidized is basically coming from the glycolysis glycolysis like all the serve and lead low glucose concentration rapidly goes down and four to six hours it P it reaches the range of 80 200 milligrams per deal in a normal adult now so the blood glucose is being oxidized through glycolysis and the ingested glucose which which was present and your meal it provided the provided energy between four to six hours now just after four to six hours just after taking just how to take a meal of for four to six hours we have another source of glucose that is it likewise generalizes a blue line is actually representing the source of glucose instead of glucose this because actually has come from the diet whereas this glucose after approximately four to six hours of taking a diet the glycogen is the glycogenolysis it is a breakdown of glycogen will start and it will reaches the peak of approximately 10 to 12 hours and it will goes down and it can be maintained even after 24 hours it is a glycogen content of a liver can maintain the blood glucose concentration from four to six hours to 24 hours and it reaches a peak of eight approximately at eight to ten hours the glycogenolysis this is a peak of 8 to 8 to 10 hours so approximately at this time the glycogenolysis is the major contribution for glucose oxidation that is that they are providing the energy through the body now at the same time as the starvation stage is this starts in two days 8 day 16 days so glycogenolysis cannot help in contributing or in providing the glucose so what will happen we have another pathway that helps in many liberal because concentration that is it likewise Gino lysis the glycogen Eliza's approximately starts at 8 hours it reaches the peak approximately after 24 whether it is one day or two days and out of an r2 of after 24 hours the glycogen or Isis will reaches its peak and it will provide the energy for glucose it provides the glucose residues for glucose oxidation that can maintain and and the normal glucose concentration so we have two ways that maintains a protocols concentration we have in the ingested glucose which comes from the diet we have glycogenolysis and then we have gluconeogenesis so in starvation we have two pathways which is which are glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis that maintains a blood glucose concentration if we see in detail it is for example in fasting norms on fasting what happens average on days are approximately for 14 hours 13 to 14 hours approximately here 13 to 14 hours so a gluconeogenesis already been started and the glycogenolysis after reaching its peak approximately 8 to 10 hours as it's going down so most both the pathways they are being activated at the end of our fasting approximately 14 to 6 hours 16 hours leave both the pathways like regionalised anyway Genesis they are both day reactivated and providing the glucose for glucose oxidation now entitiy fiber type d fiber is is the most important is another important discussion of today's discussion the DRI to fight with we have been talking about many people have been talking about it IQ fiber and their importance in the diet they are basically polysaccharide it cannot be digested by human enzymes the GI tract I she remembered that the the the plant polysaccharides they cannot be digested because we have a lack of the enzyme so they are basically polysaccharide it cannot be digested we have the cellulose we have examples of diet if ever we have cellulose hemicellulose pectins gums and Musil ages so most of the dry t fiber is being contributed from the plant kingdom so we have the major right if I will are in the form of cellulose hemicellulose pectin some time you see lasers but it is not being digested it cannot provide energy so the meet the purpose of Daiki fiber is to provide the roughage to the faeces and the most important it activates the the gastric movement then we have a non carbohydrate lignin lignin is also directly fiber is also being classified as detective happen is a non carbohydrate diet be fiber so we can classify fibers into two types the soluble and insoluble the soluble which are carbohydrate form that is viscous and the insoluble form or non fermentable they are the conform the non carbohydrate form and the carbohydrate form so the examples we have of soluble expectant gums missile ages and some Hemi cellulose in the major functions of soluble carbohydrate form fibers they delay the stomach emptying slow glucose absorption and can lower the blood cholesterol level so the food item that it contains the soluble carbohydrate form they they have generally low glycemic index because they show they slows the glucose absorption and decreases the bread did a decreases the rate of rate of increase of blood glucose after taking at night the examples we have in certain food items that contain the soluble carbohydrate forms we have a citrus fruits oranges apples bananas or product oat means carrot barley beans and so these are some of the food items that contain these soluble carbohydrate form fibers the non from multiple insoluble non carbohydrate we have we can have two types carbohydrate a non carbohydrate the lignin is a non carbohydrate form whereas the cellulose and hemicellulose is a polysaccharide the major function increase is a fecal bulk that it it provides roughage to the faeces and and it decreases the intestinal transit time the major sources for these insoluble fibers are the whole grains wheat bran all plant feed products we try rice and vegetables so most of these fibers are coming from the plant kingdom whether they are soluble or insoluble the fibers we chemica chemicals we have practiced gum insulators and hemicelluloses whereas in the insoluble form we have legmen cellulose and and other hand other hemicelluloses types and the major function is to delay the stomach emptying low glucose absorption and can lower the blood glucose cholesterol level by binding with the dry tree called stall and decreases the absorption of the cholesterol whereas the insoluble functions are increases the fecal Burgh increases the pieces roughage and increases the intrinsic intestinal transit time now if you take an example of a fruit food contains carbohydrates yes it contains monosaccharides disaccharides polysaccharides all type of carbohydrates but along with the fibers so along with the fibers that decreases its absorption and it makes it healthy now if you take an example of fibers that are present in Apple if you take in a skin the cellulose in this skin is a non fermentable fiber whereas whereas the energy expectant the viscous fiber is present in the in the soft part of the Apple so a fruit can contain both types of fibers the soluble insoluble fibers that is cellulose pectins can be present at the same time in our food washing to remember here that the fiber the major contribution of fibers in our diet comes from the plant kingdom that is from the fruits and vegetables food vegetables and seeds as well significance of fibers is disease prevention and treatment it can prevent constipation hammer white and appendicitis it can prevents severe diseases like heart diseases from myocardial infarction by simply lowering the cholesterol level because it binds with the free cholesterol which ever it is present in the diet and and decreases the absorption in the gut adult onset diabetes and glucose absorption error diabetes can also be prevented by taking by taking a significant amount of fiber in the diet because it directly decreases our glucose absorption obesity obesity yes it can prevent basically not only prevent but also can be treated by taking fibers in the diet it decreases the Society of an individual and it gives when a diet contains a fiber it gives a sense of fullness so any diet that contains a fibers it gives a sense of fullness to the individual now the Rd of carbohydrates is 130 grams approximately 130 gram that is a recommended I filled on the carbohydrate is 130 grams normal adult individual who weighs around 70 kilogram and it can be contributed can be contributed from various food items there suppose if we drink a cola it can contribute approximately 30% of the carbohydrate mmm 23% banana can contribute 22% IG / can contribute 15% and then it goes down through the carrot approximately 6% penis 5% so the most of the proportion is coming from the food items that contain refined sugars or fish occurs and it can it can it takes the major proportion it can take a major proportion of our diet approximately 30 only 30 percent or 23% now the glycemic index the glycemic index is basically a ratio is basically calculated by a glucose by a glucose response to test food / the glucose responds to the standard food multiply 500 is basically a ratio what happens here we and we can test the glycemic index of any food item so we can take a food item of your choice and say and observe its response after taking that specific food item let's suppose we we take a food item for example suppose we take what we should we take hmm we take a cereal okay oatmeal oatmeal okay so we take an oatmeal so and we will observe the glucose mother how much blood glucose will increase we divide that response that how much glucose is being increased by the glucose response to the standard food the standard food that standard food will contain approximately 50 grams of carbohydrate and standard food is most of the time we take ah we take a white bread as a standard food and then we will compare the response at how much glucose is being raised by the oatmeal and how much glucose is being raised by this white bread that contains 50 grams of carbohydrates that is being standardized that this food item will contain 550 grams of carbohydrates the UH glucose response basically is we add and week and then we multiply with hundred now this is a calculation which is easily being done but the most appropriate way of finding out the glycemic index is basically is to plot a graph and then we take a ratio so glucose response is area under the curve or the blood glucose measurements taken from three hours after the meal but at this time what you need to remember here that the glycemic index is basically a ratio between the because between a glucose response to a test food any test would any food item divided by a standardized food that contains 50 grams of carbohydrates multiplied by 100 that gives you the glycemic index and it tells you that how rapidly a food item can increase the blood glucose concentrations is basically it's a ratio between the standardized food and the and the and a food atom of here of your choice and it will it will tell you that how rapidly it increases the blood glucose concentration so ratio blood glucose response to a given food compared to a standardized food a standardized food can be free glucose or a white bread 29 50 grams of glucose now of a glycemic index ranges as it's a ratio that is multiplied be multiplied with 100 it ranges from zero to hundred it is influenced by the star structure how a carbo how complex carbon carbon hydrates are present what is the fiber content of that food item is the food item is a processed food item or it's a raw food item how is a physical structure what is its physical structure and for example a physical structure for example if we compare fruit let's take an example of a fruit for example or eating an orange as a food and drinking and orange juice that's a major difference and I eating an orange as a fruit have a look it's usually have a look I see make index as compared of drinking an orange juice that can that will be containing the high glycemic index so other micronutrients in the meal also plays an important role on influencing the on influencing it I say make and I suggest fat content if you have more fat content it will decrease its absorption and it will decrease glycemic index as well so what is the glycemic index is basically a ratio of blood glucose response to a given food compared to a to a standardized food is basically we observe that a food item how rapidly a food item can increase a blood glucose concentration as compared to the sanitized food it ranges from zero to hundred and the food items they lie in this category the categories we have is low glycemic index foods intermediate glycemic index foods and high glycemic index foods the low glycemic index foods are normally below 55 intermediate ranges from 55 to 70 and high glycemic foods are more than 70 glycemic index now okay sweet items matai bay key items colas croissants white bread all the processed foods jellies pizza white bird colas sodas they all contain processed foods in which the Israeli availability of free glucose of free sugar they all are comes in the category of high glycemic index the the food items we can have is baked potato french fries rice cakes bagels refined cereal products sugar sweetened beverages jelly beans candy Basques juices of basmati rice they all comes into into the category of high glycemic index and it should not be taken by diabetics as well as they can normal individuals should also avoid these food items that come into the category of high glycemic index foods now see potato cons and multigrain bread or brown words they all come under category of medium glycemic index it is from 56 to 69 orange juice pop conch on sweet potato brown white rice oatmeal whole grain breads pasta no sugar added juices the organ the category or the medium glycemic index foods then we have a category for example raw fruits raw vegetables and we have a daily products which comes in the category of low glycemic index that is there there are high fiber diets they contain high fibers like foods and vegetables like apple pear green beans and apricots then we have milk yogurt which are daily product that we have legumes and then we have chick peas beans lentils kidney bean they all come in the category of the low glycemic index foods and they are really helpful for a healthy for a healthy lifestyle now another concept along with the glass table index we have glycemic load it's very much similar to the glycemic index but it's a little bit different the glycemic load is basically a product of glycemic index and the amount of a carbohydrate consumed / he 100 so we take a glycemic index of a specific food and we multiply it with the how much carbohydrate is actually present in that food item and then it be divided by 100 what we get is a glycemic load now you will observe a difference between here here you will observe a difference between a glycemic index and a glycemic load a glycemic node a carbohydrate content of that food item the glycemic index of that specific food item divided by hundred what we get is the glycemic load now again we have categories of low glycemic index for example low glycemic load below 15 intermediate from 15 to 20 and high glycemic load from more than 20 now if we take an example for example vegetables the glycemic index 49 characteristic an example of a bold carrot we have a 14-9 glycemic index and reg lyceum it flowed approximately eight because its carbohydrate content is really low as compared to the big potato potato again the grams are same it glycemic index is really high it's carbohydrate grams are really high as compared to the carrot and a glycemic load is also very dynamic load is also very high so it should not help me this tells you that a baked potato can rapidly increase the blood glucose concentration and it can it can lead to certain comorbidities like it can lead to diabetes mellitus increase increase chances of myocardial infarction increased blood cholesterol level and various diseases then we have daily food items then we have fruits as you can see here if we compare apple with banana or orange the glycemic mix 38 the glycemic load of apple is 8 yes banana the glycemic index 55 and the glycemic load is 16 so if you compare apple with banana the banana is having high glycemic index and a high glycemic load beverages orange juice they all have Gatorade coca-cola 16 I see McClure so the glycemic load is much higher the orange juice as you can see here the glycemic index is 46 if you compare with the orange itself the orange the glycemic index is 44 whereas the orange juice glycemic index 46 but his glycemic load is much higher as compared to the orange itself that is 13 snacks potato chips gasevic load is 8 whereas jellybeans is very much higher at is 21 May first snacks much higher glycemic oh so these are not really healthy food items that can increase the blood glucose concentration very rapidly now similarly we can list the food items with glycemic index and a glycemic load so I am just trying to give you a sense of food items that have different glycemic index and different glycemic load so when you will go to your practices you can counsel your patients as far as these nutrition nutrition is concerned at which food items you should be taking with food items you should not be taking okay they say an example of strawberries here strawberries gaseumeun - approximately forty low glycemic index whereas glycemic load is only one that is it's really healthy not increasing the blood glucose concentration very rapidly if you compare it with dates the glycemic index the glycemic load is seventy seven much higher because it contains more and high concentration of glucose its glycemic index one hundred and three bananas 52 glycemic index and the glycemic load is twelve there is more acceptable but another more acceptable okay now we have if we if you plot if we if you if you make a four two by two chart between the glycemic index and glycemic load and we can categorize certain food items that have high glycemic index but low glycemic load for example popcorns watermelons they have high glycemic index but low glycemic load so it's it's it's not it's it's really healthy to take these food items that is a whole wheat floor ok so they have high glycemic index but very low glucose load whereas on the other hand we have certain food items that may have low glycemic index but high glycemic load for example macaronis spaghetti again they have high glycemic load and they can they can but they can have a bad effect they can the body is taking more more glucose content in the form of these food items like macaroni spaghetti and they are not really healthy okay so we have reached our our end of this discussion the the reference for these books are Lippincott then we have Harper nutrition - absorption chapter 43 and then we have advanced nutrition and human metabolism and the group and copper 2000 so now any queries please start the Q&A session student if you are listening please if you have any queries write in your chat box [Music] he says so when selecting a dye should we go for glycemic index okay now we have to take care of both glycemic index and the glycemic load as well as as a nutritionist you should be observing both the glycemic index electronic load both at the same time okay healthy carbs are those which have a high glycemic I am so sorry men have morta murtaza healthy carbs are those which have low glycemic index low glycemic index and low glycemic load but they are certain certain food items that have high glycemic index and low glycemic these are these are only basically these are some of the some food items they are actually particularly with the classic glycemic load healthy healthy food items are those as far as the glucose concentration is concerned are those that have low glycemic index and low glycemic load but we have certain odds that have for example watermelon watermelon is having a high glycemic index but low glycemic load so you can take those food items like watermelon you can take watermelon instead of having high glycemic index it do not contains high amounts of carbohydrate so someone asked you that Canada beat can a patient who is suffering from diabetes can he eat watermelon your answer should be is that yes but in a moderate amount in a low amount okay sir though the liver is carrying out all the processes of glucose metabolism but it is dependent on pancreas almost yes correct so wiping hair is not considered the master control of blood because okay master control of blood glucose okay it it is basically yes is an endocrine gland it's an exocrine gland the endocrine part skew insulin and glucagon but it controls the metabolisms the same metabolisms which are taking place in the liver in the parasites the insulin is acting on the metabolic pathways the glucagon is acting on the same metabolic pathway which are taking place in in in the parasites this excessive sweating okay nausea Pervez thank you for asking disk does excessive sweating lower blood glucose levels it's actually the other way around it's this excessive sweating do not decreases a blood glucose concentration but whenever we have lower blood glucose levels the sign and symptoms can be excessive certain died for reasons so it's really tricky excessive sweating itself do not decreases the blood glucose concentration but it this sign and symptom excessive sweating diaphoresis can be a company during hypoglycemia okay any queries he please students are may rub I made up what you have shared head by a cam tightly carbohydrate what this PDF document is can you please elaborate can you please tell me I can hypoglycemia cause postural hypotension no not at all Alicia can hypoglycemia cause no not a posture tension but again postural hypotension you can is a different thing personal high potential itself is a different thing hypoglycemia can cause certain sign and symptoms of confusion coma so it's really different from postural hypotension gee students I think we have exceeded our time it's 10:35 hello ossify gee we have already exceeded our times 10:35 so can we end our presentation now okay gee thank you spoonful list", "AQ1XfWB6pAQ": "Jolly Ranchers recently flipped the script with the introduction of these new Fruit Chews taking their traditional hard candy and making it soft what crazy times are afoot obviously welcome once again everyone to walk into candy aisle my name is Jeff today we're looking at Jolly Ranchers new Fruit Chews candy and boy oh boy and so on has been a little while coming they came out about a month ago and I was interested in them but I did not pick them up because I am not generally speaking a jolly rancher fan I know part of the part of the issue is the texture which theoretically this might be able to address but also I've never really liked the Jolly Rancher flavors too much so you know bias be known I'm not a huge jolly rancher friend going into this can this change my mind I don't know but I did get some requests to to check this one out so I am doing it for you the viewers so these are chewy chewy Jolly Ranchers that's that's the idea here they come in cherry watermelon green apple and blue raspberry flavors in this handy-dandy box the they're also they also launched a tropical variety of fruit shoes which I believe has pineapple and lemon I don't know it's got some mother you know it's got tropical sort of flavors in it you have to go look that up if you want it I didn't know that existed I'd never saw that in the store I just saw it online but apparently it's around and they have them the what's it called like the chomp and chew I don't know what it is it's like a ha they also have another variety that your are that is around in stores a lot now which is like the hard outer a hard outer shell of a Jolly Rancher and then the interior of this chewy version which that's interesting because then I would imagine you could pair like I don't know you know strawberry outside with Kiwi inside or I have no idea if that's even flavors the Jolly Rancher has because like I said I don't really eat Jolly Rancher candies because I you know I don't generally like the flavor I have add them you know not not recently but I have had them growing up of course everyone like a lot of people like them just not me for some reason but I just they just never really stuck with me I think it's something about the flavors just seemed a bit a bit too intense in a way that I didn't like like artificially intense because I liked strong flavors I liked starburst and I like skittles but something about Jolly Ranchers I don't know so anyway let's have a look at this I'm going to give trying to this a fair shake I do like the packaging it's like this little like it's almost like a cigarette box it's like this tear you tear off a strip here tear chair and inside are individually wrapped Jolly Rancher Fruit Chews now I open this box before and I got these and four more and these four now I pulled these aside because these are all the different flavors but just to note in this box I only got one watermelon and one blue raspberry everything else was green apple in watermelon or sorry watermelon and cherry or wait a second what wait what are this ones the watermelon this one's watermelon what's that say on it yeah that's the watermelon flavor okay so these ones are the green apple that makes sense so all I got was green apple and cherry and then I got one blue blue raspberry and one water than one watermelon that's kind of weak honestly you guys got it you got to figure that out I complain about this every single time I get a big bag of different flavored stuff but honestly it's a little more excusable for Jelly Belly or that or something that has like a hundred different flavors to only have one or two of a certain flavor this is like come on guys there are four flavors there's only four you should be able to get a good mix of them in here alright enough of that put that down let's have a look so nice little like you know sort of a bazooka Joe's style here individually wrapped I like that they're individually wrapped that's nice give them a friends tear and share just like they say that's cool I do like the packaging the the logo I think that's kind of cool I always like the Jolly Rancher like they always had good colors and good sort of art could graphic design on them yeah I'm hoping that the that these will these will be good I you know I'd like them to be good I just I'm a little bit concerned that they won't be let's see how do I get that off tear tear tear maybe I should try different flavor for goodness sakes so this is the green apple not my favorite flavor that's probably another thing I know Jolly Rancher comes in flavors that I generally am not a huge fan of like green apple like cherry um but that's okay give this a shot goodness me okay so I'm thinking that this is supposed to come off easier than that maybe I'm just a idiot and I can't get it off so there it is just a little kind of slightly tacky maybe that's just the humidity I mean looks like it looks like a piece of gum like piece of bright green day cloak gum this is probably the flavor that I'm not going to like and then I'll try a flavor that I am going to like here yeah green apple let's give it a shot oh okay yeah okay so this is one of those starts out hard and goes soft what is that hmm I don't know anyway this is one of those starts at hard goes soft sticks in your teeth any candies brawl that totally stuck in my teeth that's not it's like completely stuck in my teeth it hmm okay you know it tastes like green apple tastes like a strong green apple like in the way that Jolly Ranchers tastes like green apple it's intense it's completely stuck in my teeth though slowly slowly dissolving that's not really a super pleasant experience I'm going to try this some blue whatever it is blue raspberry because if there's one flavor of these for that I'm going to really like that's this one because I like raspberries and I like blue raspberries because they're blue oh Jesus this wrapping is not coming off easy either okay this wrapping should be easier to come off is it me is it humidity I don't know whatever it is I'm not impressed okay I'm just going to have this bite now the flavors okay I mean guys I don't I don't know what to say here look if you like Jolly Ranchers you're probably going to like this I don't like the texture I think the flavors are slightly over overblown you know but I would probably say the same thing about regular Jolly Ranchers I'm not a fan these are not for me all candy is not for everyone that's a fact I'm going to pass on these I don't know I think you probably should too if you like telling Ranchers maybe you'll like this give it a shot I guess but look this is not this is just not a great showing sorry Jolly Rancher Fruit Chews I think I tried and it's not for me maybe it's for you out there if you guys are jolly rancher fans give it a shot for me I'm sorry I got to give it I'm going to give it a 2 a 2 out of 5 it's just um it's just not right for me anyway if you guys want to see more come on over to walking the candy Alda blog spot.com and yeah I hope to see you there thanks everyone later", "d3yiZRzZef0": "please take a suit you are probably wondering why I've called you in here today simply put it's a very important matter and one I think everyone we both know is concerned about namely why are you [Music] waz up guys it's your boy Stan coming after with another conspiracy most of you are probably familiar with the flavor known as blue raspberry however the story of how it came to be is much less well known once upon a time the raspberry flavor was colored a dark red the chemical used to do so red and number two amaranth was later deemed toxic and banned by the FDA used to studies which indicated it could cause cancer in female rats when ingested in high doses however it has never been proven that it poses any health risks to humans and is still legally used in areas outside of America such as Europe and Canada there is a replacement dye red number 40 Allura red but this was not approved for consumption at the time and has recently been subject to scrutiny as well lacking another dye for the raspberry flavor and having no use for the dazzling brilliant blue FCF blue raspberry was born the flavor is supposedly derived from rubus loco dermis a variety of raspberry with an unusual color but even this isn't actually blue it's either red purple or black depending on ripeness the thing I think is interesting about this is that there's no reason inherent to the raspberry that caused the flavor to be colored blue other artificial flavors and colors are meant to convince us they're similar to the fruit with varying degrees of effectiveness blue raspberry is literally a match of a spare color with an unrelated flavor which companies needed one for but it's become sort of a cultural fixture if you say something as a blue raspberry flavor do people know what that means and they may also expect blue flavors to be raspberry despite the fact that no actual raspberry is blue there's no good reason for us berry to be blue but it very often is that's what I call a conspiracy don't forget to leave a like if you enjoyed it and subscribe if you want to become a conspirator let me know in the comments if you know about any other conspiracies or want to know about the strange history of artificial food coloring until next time it's your man the Waze giving you the razzle des

and I'm doing a Mamba there 24 Fruit Chews and it's a massive package it says four to six packs in there stork it just looks so inviting orange strawberry lemon raspberry fruit choose Mamba 24 fruit juice aren't officially just look at that going by the screen there okay are you hungry for a Mamba well I am so let me open it up you've seen all the sides nice packaging colorful I'm just mesmerized by the size I can't even tell what's in here we'll attach the text it's a pack with lots of little packs ooh I like that a lot let me go to the raspberry alright now I'll tell you what I'm gonna do lemon let me see what's in here okay so they're individually wrapped in a wrap and a large wrapper so now I'm down to my third wrapper here is a Mamba okay I'm going to bring in a starburst too and I'll tell you what I've got here a Japanese high chew so we've got three different kinds of chewy products here bring the camera down and let me open up some more flavors here you know you got to see them all have any means one yet my mouth is watering so here's the orange I could tell right away they are much harder than either of the two tubes we have here here that oh no difference sound wise it just feel wise let me open up strawberry all right so there's a strawberry making a big mess here opening all this stuff let me get these two these two out of the way for now so we're just looking at the mom box get one each out now people ask what you do with what we do with the candy after it's been video well guess what it gets eaten okay so there's all the flavors I'm going to start with this lemon and take a bite it uh actually it pulls apart pretty good and it's definitely not the same consistency of a starburst let me try it so it's different than the starbursts I'm definitely different than a heichou try one of these other ones the orange it's crazy but it's kind of between the tulle so colorful so that all right I'm gonna finish these to kind of leave you with that I like them of course I like all Fruit Chews they're tasty which has the strongest flavor I'm going to say a starburst I got one here it does so there you go I'm still trying to chew here thanks for watching

weekend we had some stuff that we had to do for our friends but we're back and today I want to make something that's quick and easy but something that's been requested a lot by you so I'm gonna make a blue raspberry candy recipe [Music] there's a lot of people who want a nice blue raspberry candy they go out looking for the best blue raspberry flavoring that there is out there and in my opinion I found a pretty good way to create blue raspberry in fact I had skittles in the beginning of DIY our dye vaping comm write an article about blue raspberry 4 in the mix magazine that now-defunct in the mix magazine and during that time I was also developing misty which is one of my favorite recipes if you haven't tried misty pick it up because it's an excellent recipe one of my favorites and it incorporates a blue raspberry flavor into the e-liquid it's very vibrant it's great in any type of device and I'm not saying it's just to show the product I'm saying it because it's a great blue raspberry flavoring it's not just blue raspberry but it definitely has a blue raspberry base in there and you can look at the recipe over on my website I'll put the link down in the description but it was during that time where I was trying to figure out how to make the best blue raspberry recipe and I found a pretty easy combination of flavorings that will get you a great blue raspberry flavor now it's not quite like a blue raspberry Jolly Rancher I haven't quite figured out how to how to get that type of profile out but it's it's darn close to it so let's begin mixing the first ingredient that in my opinion is necessary for this blue raspberry flavor if you're not using a blue raspberry flavoring I've tried a bunch out there I'm not impressed by them Capello's blue raspberry cotton candy not impressed and I found that just making your own blue raspberry just it works much better you get a much more vibrant flavor but the main ingredient of it is boysenberry I'm gonna be using full of ORS boysenberry but you can also use flavor west boysenberry as well they're both very good I just like floors a little bit more because it is a little bit more candied it does have a little bit more sweetness to it and that's why I enjoy using it in this recipe we're mixing it up at 5% I'm only making 10 mils so it's gonna come out to around 0.5 grams and this just gives the blue raspberry it kind of contains most of the flavor the ingredients that we're gonna add after it just help lift it up a little bit in it and the ingredient that we had after it also helped the raspberry aspect of it helps give it a little bit more punch this is an excellent flavouring wonderful avoir is best in my opinion also the boysenberry from flavour was excellent as well they're both very good flavor West is just a little bit more deep I feel like it's a little bit more ripe in a way and more authentic to a real boysenberry but we're making a candy so I'm gonna be using flavors moving on is Lauren's raspberry you can use any raspberry that you like I have medicine flour raspberry here you could use any where is raspberry just make sure you keep that one low because it can overpower the boysenberry but I find Lorraine's raspberry is great because it does contain like a nice wild raspberry note but it also keeps the raspberry kind of in the body where where I want it I want a lot of that cotton candy sugary flavor and the front and then the raspberry on the finish I'm using this at 4 and 1/2 percent your results may vary depending on what raspberry flavoring you use and I find that Lauren's raspberry outclassed is even tfh sweet raspberry it's a pretty underrated raspberry it's a grape flavoring if you like raspberries just check it out you know you can also use flavor arts but I find that one a little bit too authentic for this profile Laurens works perfectly fine and the last ingredient there's really only one ingredient left that we're going to be adding and that's ethyl maltol or cotton candy I'm only using it at 0.25% you can go up to a half a percent and what this does is really infuse the raspberry with that blue raspberry candied sweetness it kind of inherently sweetens the raspberry and just adds it turns it more into blue raspberry which what we know is really just a raspberry flavor just with added sweetness last I'm just gonna be adding a touch of sweetener just 0.25% it's not much but I do want to add a little bit of sweetness to kind of help lift the profile give it more vibrant music flavor West sweetener you can use any sweetener you like you don't even need to use sweetener obviously and I did want to mention Capella's silver line 27 fish or TFA's swedish fish even even flavor West's I'm not going to be adding this in here but if you did want a blue raspberry kind of gummy flavor this would be a great ingredient to use you can use it at 1/2 percent and it will add in that that kind of chewiness that gummy flavor that some raspberry candies can have I'm mixing mine up at 50/50 just because I'm gonna be putting this in a tank later but if you want a more kind of voluminous experience you know you can turn that up a little bit and then one milligram of nicotine remember I do not condone nor encourage any use of nicotine this is purely entertainment purposes so if you use it I didn't tell you to do it [Music] course vote for trip [Music] and there you go man that's a blue raspberry candy recipe it does resemble that blue raspberry Jolly Rancher flavor that a lot of people are after if you wanted to you can use capela super sweet to really pump up that sweetness and make it more vibrant make it much more accurate to that profile well like I said add in some 27 fish to give it a little bit of a chew but the way this is right now and the recipe that will be in the description is it's a great recipe vibrant it'll work in the tank a sub tank and RDA to work in anything very bold flavor nice sweetness to

fruit made I was in a while was a store haven't been in a while I was in a minute because of a lot of the wild was in a New England just like move like down south when you traveling it'd be like early dead early the morning maybe like 3:00 in the morning you want some breakfast you could just go poppin you little order Lego making you get the receipt oh I was is the joint man picked up two gums one was a juicy fruit bubblegum sour watermelon by juicy fruit BAM and the other was hubba bubba sour blue raspberry right here um I'm a big fan of juicy fruit always love juicy fruits flavor juicy fruit had that distinct flavor where you can't just the regular juicy fruit is just like ain't nothing come close to it and the thing is when you eat the juicy fruit in three minutes you spitting out trying to reload again Hubba Bubba yo hubba bubba is the joint everybody know hubba bubba they smell so good now hubba bubba is classic as old school got that distinct flavor has that distinct smell to it ah how about a pack of hubba bubba wills make your car smell so good or just open in a pack and have it on you people would know you have guns like oh you got gum you ever be chewing gum you don't want people to especially in school you know you break off a little piece you you know cuz you can't eat gum in school you be having it like in the song you between my somebody look ate by time you look it's like three people looking at like like don't be much a business man they're all bent up because you can see how it arches and because it's been in my back pocket pressed up against my butt this is the sour watermelon now the watermelon is you know dependent on the candy watermelons are green you know some watermelon of candy or gum it's like pinkish your body almost look like a little little Mambo an hour later or something smells so good man I taste a hey go that summer is hitting me right now whoa my temples are starting to sting whoo spidey sense is tingling oh man you know this is how I'm starting to sweat already even though I'm in a closed car and it's about 80 outside in October ah there's the sweet flavor and still holding its tangy sour flavor to it ah I'm just a punk for sour flavor Marable whoo it's kind of sour it's not crybaby sour Wow I gotta say juicy fruit is sweet oh it's tangy it don't really taste like watermelon just a little bit but that sour overwhelms it it's more like like a lime Kiwi lime yeah I'll give this a four the flavor wise that's a good rate for you boy see snacks man this is good I want to buy this again let's try to help above a joint how over my gum man when these have the package they got like a little red line and just go around the pack of gum like a thing of sardines it pops it open nice and easy like some lipstick or something like Boop this is it old school classic wrapper I like these colors the purple yellow white right here yeah yeah yeah like the tasting it go this is sour also regardless of the flavor of all the hubbub bubbles it still has a like it'll have the flavor of what it's called but after a while we start to lose the flavor it goes back to the original hubbub of a flavor the original flavor you taste that before and just get completely blend this reminds me of doing tricks with my and my BMX bike man when I when I stole a pair of pegs from Bradley's back on days kids y'all know about Brad he's way ahead of your time man but Bradley's was like a k-mer or Walmart and they didn't really have their own products but they sold different different products I don't remember that if they had their own product but hey so everything it's like a Walmart and I remember I went there and I didn't have enough for some pegs I was like ninety-seven cents short my little bad self man I stole two pegs that going back on my own being mention because somebody stole mine so yeah to my shame I stole the pair of pegs kids do not try that don't do that yeah I'm saying you gonna get caught and it ain't worth it cuz I got nad security before you ain't had no security cameras they just had like a dude like an undercover cop up in there that's what they had those old security camera there was no security camera those old cameras zoom into your back pocket I can actually watch you on the phone there was none that it was just a dude in there and I got caught and they had me sign some papers and I had to wait forget my mom to come pick me up and my mom whoop my ass I gotta go with the sour a watermelon because this flavor from juicy forget last longer it's much more sweeter this is more 10-year I stuck with this one because it held its flavor longer than the blue raspberry blue raspberry it was born when I was talking to you and um yeah have you ever seen these two try these two if you see these two in the store snatch them up together man and give a taste off yourself man on or leave a comment if you get to buy these leave a comment you boys see snacks man so yeah this is also a four also but I like these better I will buy these over these or if I had the money I'll buy them both together man it's your Boise snacks peace", "xohpk8ezBeo": "okay that is really now these at meijer i'm going to get the punch one and see how it tastes okay welcome to the video so that footage was me taste testing so i ended up earlier today going to a cereal cafe and i had a fruity pebbles waffle and then a s'mores shake life-changing experience anyways so those were a couple seconds of me trying that i am going to try i finally found these i was looking for them all over because anything that people try on tic tac i have to try except for the nature's cereal i i don't know if i want to try this so this is the juicy drop gummy dippin sticks so this is what it looks like i got the flavor knockout punch but they came in a bunch of other flavors this was 199 and then it's got like this gooey stuff so yeah that's what it looks like this looks actually really good but also like i will get a cavity or a sugar high from this hmm that reminds me of the mr squeezy pop that i ate that's really good i'll try just this so the gummy part is like okay but doesn't really actually have that much flavor to it because it doesn't really have a sour taste like you really need to combine these two to really make it work um i'm probably still going to finish it off but i'm really full from all the starbucks i drink but this is pretty good i would give it candy wise a solid 8 out of 10. that's going to do it for the video hey guys so so much for watching have a great day", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "3IzZFBPAFQs": "raspberries are one of the most popular fruits in the world and are generally consumed year round by

gummies i have the original wild berry these were 298 each at walmart and what is so funny is we bought them at the same walmart but two separate weeks so one week they only had the wild berry i went back the next week to check to see if they had gotten the original in these had been replaced with these so they didn't have them both at the same time it was weird so we're gonna start with the original there's five flavors in here there's grape lemon green apple strawberry and orange and it says this these are the actual size of what's in the box they feel like little gummy little round dips they feel uh slippery like one of those toys that just so uh one ounce 28 grams about 14 pieces is 190 calories there's 12 servings in the bag www.skittles.com it's their website this is a resealable bag which is always good nice i have a feeling though if i had this next to me that it wouldn't get resealed that often okay smells good so i'm not sure i'm not going to pour out the whole bag i'm just going to pour out like that many and we'll see if we got one of each did we get some i'm sure we got one of these no we didn't because there's only oh no there's two yellows right there where you see now yelling right here hidden okay i got five uh this one and red i got them all i didn't get a dark red okay so what was that no you got two of the same i felt like [Applause] [Music] it should look like that oh yeah they were covered they're very close to the red ones so you pick which one goes first i don't care do the do the get the white pink one i'm making him decide i do like the size of them you know what there are only five so the ones that look pink and red are they the same thing that's what i thought it's like they look awfully close some of them look darker red i thought there were six because one of them looks they're horrendous it does like in a starburst you have a pink and then you have a red that's what that look like here um those are good and that was strawberry but it tastes just like a skittles i mean literally yeah it tastes as close you get to skittles without being skittles yes but what do you think of the texture it's good it's a little more gummy i mean it's a little more sticky yeah like a gumdrop kind of texture and gummy texture but but it's nice i like orange slices or the dots or something like that's the kind of texture you get or the inside of a jelly bean a dots yeah that's kind of the texture that's what it's like it like dots it's not like a chewy gummy although it's similar but throw in between that orange is strong it's going [Applause] for me that's a much stronger flavor and it has a little bit of that acidic flavor uh it's not for me it's not just candy 100 percent right it because there is an acidic um acidity to it yeah like a little bite yeah but i mean it's much stronger than the strawberry one okay now we have lemon i'm just choosing you saw how long it takes kevin to choose that's good it's got the same like a little tartness to it as well it's right on the borderline of being chemical that's right yeah that wouldn't be one that i would want all the time i don't think it's bad it's not that it's not strong enough to be really bad i like the lemon skittles much more than yes because this is more uh this is uh has more of a tartness to it yeah it's artificially kind of like grape that's what i'm gonna pick next to you guys oh that's the green green apple that is delicious no that's good and green apples so they don't have a watermelon in them no that'd be of good i am a purist when it comes to skittles i would rather they had lime i like the lime in the uk they still have lime i don't know why i don't it doesn't matter i would rather have lime and black currant than grape and green apple that's just me i would take that i would switch um because i love that lime that much i like the lime too i i appreciate the flavor a while uh the uh okay so name your your fav favorite and length favorite uh my favorite is probably gonna be the strawberry i really like the strawberry okay um my least favorite is probably the lemon one because that apple i like strawberry and lemon okay my favorite is the grape yeah and my least favorite is the lemon yeah the lemon is just it tastes very artificial yeah it's right on the edge of the hand cleaner okay now we have berry punch melon berry strawberry uh wild cherry and rice and raspberry so uh so we have a strawberry in both of these but there's two red ones in this one yes wild cherry and strawberry so it's the same calories i like these this is one of those things i could keep in the cabinet in the drawer and just grab a handful and go yeah even though i really didn't care for the luminesce oh yeah these are so now you do have the reds are very yes are you getting out for a picture or for you for me okay let's draw the berry punch since we just tried great dark one yeah it's the purple one it'll be interesting to see which bag i would buy because if you only have three dollars to buy one bag that definitely tastes different than grape oh yeah actually i like that i like the grape more little punchy flavor it does there's yeah there's a little bit of a like a tropical punch add it in with the grape yeah okay how about the melon the grain yeah okay you gotta tell me the green melon berry that's your watermelon a little bit a little more earthy than that is primarily a watermelon so the watermelon that they didn't put in this one has a little bit of a berry mix to it with it though i very much like it it's very good i like it quite a bit um the wild cherry is i'm assuming the dark one what's a blue one raspberry tastes like yes it tastes like a lifesaver yeah that's what it exactly was just like a lifesaver and raspberry someone's very light well i mean it's it's strong and we already had strawberry you're gonna eat a new one it should taste the exact same as what was in this bag [Applause] um this bag i have uh there's uh different ones honestly though this whole bag there wasn't one that i didn't like right yeah i think i would buy the mixed berry bag just because i like every single flavor in it whereas the uh original bag i did not like that lemon at all well i would pick out the ones i'm sure kevin and i would end up splitting this bag well i bought it like a lemonade or something i would leave all the all the lemon would you go to white we would just take pickles and see you would probably eat all those green apples yeah i would eat them i wouldn't necessarily green apple yeah that wouldn't be what i want i like to talk about better soup the mixed berries mixed berries mixed berry they should do a tropical now that you mention it they could do pineapple pina colada uh all those lifesaver they put mango in there yeah they'd have to put a mango in there just so we can coconut coconut yes they need to do about tropical they have a tropical skittles so i know that's what i'm saying i'm sure that's their plans are they're like these are already if these go over yeah so out of this bag what was your cherries my favorite and the least favorite probably the blue it's hard to pick at least favorite because they're all good they're all good but probably the blue one would be the one honestly me i like to save the best ones for last so i would eat all the blue ones first just to get rid of them right um i think the wild cherry is going to be my favorite as well and i really don't have a least favorite no what is that oh yeah if you if you had to rank them the only reason i picked the blue ones because it just wasn't as strong a flavor right but but now this is the this is the bag to get for us um unless you really like a tartar lemon that kind of i mean it's right on the edge uh then you might really like those a lot so i hope you can find them in your walmart or somewhere else i have not seen them anywhere but walmart they were on a special they were on one of those box displays and uh they didn't even have them at our local walmart so i've checked our local walmart again and again again they didn't have them this is a a bigger walmart and uh they were on one not not a bunch of displays one display so you really have to be looking for them and want to get them we even that we've gone down the candy out didn't know no they're not in the candy out so you i'm sure that's where they will end up being but for right now i guess since they're new that's why they're not there but i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "bjBEFrVG9Xc": "today's review is ghost energy sour patch kid blue raspberry so this is the newest flavor that just dropped with the four other ones that you've seen in my previous review this also features the v2 formula which i will go over in full with what changes were made and why ghost made those changes first of all where can you find the product it's at all vitamin shops it's at select gnc stores and select circle k stores in illinois nevada missouri and arizona so now that we know hey this is where you can start to find these i would start trying to see if you can roll out to your gnc's or vitamin shops to see if you have any luck picking these up so the reason i have my tub here is because this bcaa flavor that's made in v2 is basically carrying over that flavor into this energy drink now let's talk about the formula and what was changed so if we grab an older can in a newer can v1 v2 it may be a little bit hard to see there some of the key things that the company noted was sometimes there's a little bit of like a smell like when you open the cans so what they did was they removed and altered some of the b vitamins and also removed thiamin which was one of the forms of the b vitamins one other change that you will note in here is the removal of alkar one gram of alkar for one gram of carnipure carnitine so that is one of the major changes in there besides that 200 milligrams of natural caffeine you get the one gram of taurine 150 milligrams alpha gpc i think 125 100 of neuro factor for brain health the cognitive enhancement that you find with the alpha gpc and 25 milligrams of estrogen which helps the uptake of all the things that are in the energy drink so it makes it a little bit more effective but overall you're here because why how does it taste how does it rack up versus the other flavors so out of the get go citrus wasn't my favorite neither was the mango those at the two bottom i like the warhead and the spk red berry these are actually two of my all-time favorite energy drinks amongst all brands but knowing with how good this tastes and adding the carbonation it's probably only going to make things better so let's get into it so cheers to all you legends out there sbk blue razz with the new carnipure carnitine instead of the all car so i'm a big fan of alcar but the reason why the company decided to get rid of it was because when alcar is in liquid solutions for long periods of times it can lose its effectiveness so that's one of the reasons why alcar had to go and the thing you have to appreciate about ghost is they take the consumer feedback with the taste and what what they're seeing and make the modifications for their client base so overall really looking forward to this one cheers to all you guys here we go it's exactly how i expected it to taste so if you've had like i said the blue razz bcaa very pure flavor you know the blue raspberry complimenting flavors are dead on 50 50 split nothing overpowers each other everything congeals properly it's not as dense as the red berry the red berry packs a little bit more punch a little bit more candy punch but what i like about this is how dense and pure the flavor is because of that i'm gonna give this one the edge over the red berry not to say the red berry is not as good it is i just haven't had a v2 one yet to really compare with the change in the formula going off taste overall the blue razz is absolutely nailed absolutely nailed to a tee like i said if you like this this is only better due to the carbonation but overall check your circle k's the select ones that i talked about there the select gnc's vitamin shops now you know a little bit more about the formula change if you guys pick this up let me know what you think let me know your feedback ghost and myself are always looking forward to what you have to say about it so hope you enjoy the review have a great day", "6oMigYhlBYI": "ten berries you've never heard of number ten salmon berry the salmon berry yes an awful name for berry is a raspberry looking berry with a lighter color this berry starts off yellow and turns a light red when it becomes ripe

creeks they are a rich source of vitamin C and K and are high in manganese the salmon berries not ideal for eating but better for making it to jams juice and wine most berry bushes have multiple uses with the salmon berry the bark and leaves of the bush can be used to treat burns the name comes from an old native tradition of putting one of the berries in every Salmons mouth that was caught for good luck number nine crowberry The Crow berry or otherwise known as black crow berry or Moss berry is a round purplish berry that has a very acidic bitter taste to it they can be consumed raw but

jellies ice cream wine and juice and also have been used in cosmetics the crow berry is high in vitamin C k manganese and copper number eight pine berry this white looking strawberry has a reputation for tasting and/or smelling like pineapple plus strawberries this is debatable but there is a tropical element to the berry which would give that impression the flavor is more of a tart tropical tasting berry with a muted flavor they are native to Chile and are available in early summer if you can find them the primary can be eaten fresh or served with desserts like ice cream cake and even mixed in drinks they are a partially self pollinating plant that are high in antioxidants vitamin A and boost the immune system unless you live in Chile they're very hard to find so if you do find them they're gonna be very expensive number 7 Hawthorn these bright red berries are grown on a thorny Bush that has insanely sharp needles the red berries get darker as the season goes on to indicate its ripeness the young leaves of the bush can be eaten and the old leaves can be used to make a tea the berry itself tastes a mixture of sweet and tart just make sure to spit out the large cherry like seed as they contain cyanide the Hawthorne berry has powerful healing effects to the heart including reducing blood pressure and increased circulation Hawthorne is dropped into the superfood category so typically if you see them being used it's in some magic potion to help you lose weight or feel better don't be fooled by these products but the Hawthorne berry is very good for the heart number six gin berry or orange berry these semi transparent pinkish berries grow in large clusters the berry is edible but the very large seed isn't they grow in warm climates and can't endure frost many aspects are very similar to the blueberries such as they grow in a bush or short tree the berry size that can be grown in a planter and they don't grow indoors very well the gin berry is typically eaten raw or juiced number five bear bury the bear bear is a small round red berry that grows on a small ground level bush these small berries have a thick skin and are very granular they taste not much like of anything in our melee and have a slight sour and bitter notes to their flavor they're most commonly used in porridge and oatmeal and not so much eaten raw bear berries grow in the Arctic and Alpine regions of the world caution should be taken when consuming them though they may cause nausea and constipation if too many are consumed if you consume them for a long period of time they may cause stomach and liver problems as well which is why it's recommended that children and pregnant women avoid eating them all together number four fairy bell berries these are looking berries are bright red and grow in the shape of bells hence the name fairy bells not only do they look unusual they grow out of large leaves and clusters which is bizarre in itself the fruit itself doesn't have any real markings or seeds on the outside like other berries just too smooth yet fuzzy red exterior they don't have all that much taste of them just a bland flavor with minor sweetness that comes through the fairy Bell berries grow in moist forested areas that range from Arizona United States all the way up to British Columbia Canada number three fall Solomon seal this edible berry has a mottled color which transitions from green to dark red as it ripens he grows in large clusters like grapes and has the taste of molasses mixed with the tart skin of a Concord grape these berries as well as the rest of the plant have been used to treat a plethora of medical problems by numerous native tribes all over North America the root is edible and cooked like a sweet potato the young shoots are boiled and tastes like asparagus the fall Solomon seal is high in vitamin see so if anything you can ward off scurvy with these little berries number two Solomon seal a completely different plant that just looks similar to its false counterpart yields berries that are dark purple both plants developed white flowers but instead of a large plume of tiny flowers the Solomon seal has flowers that hang in a row from the stalk these flowers will develop into green berries that will eventually turn purple when ripe the ripe berries taste just like molasses just as the false ones do but have a delicate sweetness to them with that said the berries are actually poisonous and may cause vomiting and nausea this is the major difference between the Solomon plants the root and young shoots are perfectly edible on the Solomon seal as well number one kusa dogwood buries the kusa dogwood is a tree that gives life to the kusa dogwood berry a round oddly shaped berry that has appearance of a soccer ball the inside is soft and creamy with the taste of papaya but the skin has a slight bitter taste to it for this reason people often bite the fruit and suckle the pulp and spit out the skin the berry is native to China Korea and Japan and is eaten raw or made into wine each fruit has two to three raisin like seeds on the inside that need to be spit out this can be a deterrent for some people to consume them along with a weird rough outer casing texture the flavor of the fruit can vary quite a bit from tree to tree so if you have the pleasure of trying these sample from multiple trees to find

welcome back to a kendama k-- thirsty Thursdays just for you I was in a convenience store this morning and noticed these Jolly Rancher drinks and remembered that a bunch of guys told me about them that they existed I just never seen them before until today soon as I saw them there's a whole shelf of different flavors in the fridge section this one is strawberry and this one's while oh sorry blueberry blue raspberry if I was gonna be a wild berry for a second there and this is a 20 ounce 20 fluid ounce bottle or 591 milliliters and it's a hundred and ten calories per serving and their serving is eight fluid ounces or 240 so it's probably like 220 plus calories per bottle if you drink the whole thing obviously let's go in quickly to do the blue raspberry artificially flavored nose 0% fruit juice and it's a 31 grams of sugar probably again per serving in 35 milligrams of sodium carbohydrates just 31 I don't think it's good I don't think it's going to be oh it is I didn't think it was gonna be carbonated you're that whoa it tastes like you just bit into a raspberry it's got that sour raspberry flavor not overly carbonated Wow artificially flavored a listen tastes like ice artificially flavored tastes like it's got the real juice in there all right let's go into the strawberry there's no name beside strawberry no it's just straight-up strawberry since I opened it up whoa that smells like artificially flavored that doesn't smell like artificially flavored this one's like almost overly scented artificially scented not too keen on the strawberry this should have bought some actual Jolly Ranchers just to compare but this this doesn't taste that good I don't know why whatever flavor they used whatever chemically flavored stuff they used to make it taste like strawberry it didn't do a very good job at all look ingredients carbonated water is the number one thing high fructose corn fructose corn syrup natural and artificial flavor and well it wasn't that good this one's definitely better I'd buy this one over that one any day red loses this would be a would not recommend doesn't really taste like strawberry it just it tastes like a horribly flavoured drink I don't know what I've had better strawberry flavored things that had no juice in it but that would be a would not recommend but this would be a total recommend a Sinkin mate would it be a go out and get it now it's not like blow in my mind for the fact that be like oh my gosh I gotta go and get another one of these it is very good again way better than that not to go out and get it out compared to that but that is a very very nice flavored Jolly Rancher soda so guys there you go if you're interested in grabbing a quick whoa beverage next time you're in a convenience store I totally recommend the Jolly Rancher blue whoo raspberry I keep wanting to say wild and I know that's wrong so blue raspberry give it a shot my recommendation from me to you if you've had them and you have a better idea of a better flavor all there goes my cat if you think there's a better flavor out there let me know in the comments below I'll read through them and I'll go and buy two more flavors and we'll do it in the next couple weeks coming up to do some more reviews of Jolly Ranchers make sure you give me two to compare but definitely this is a wouldn't and a little happening here but try that

shoot the messenger syndrome because I've gotten a lot of backlash but having been the one to deliver this news to people I just wanted people to be informed I just wanted to highlight the in justices of being lied to I never thought that this pterodactyl video might be the downfall of my career or my defining video look at this it has been immortalized as my largest crime so I am here today to try to make it up to you guys I might have been the one to take pterodactyls away from you but in turn I want to give you something back are you ready because I am giving you blue raspberries but Christina blue raspberry isn't real it's just a flavor that was invented to give us blue candy and ice cream because there aren't any blue foods everybody knows that no gentle subscriber you're wrong blue raspberry is in fact based in reality it started with the ice pop back in the 1950s back when otter pops and flavor ice were first invented there was a lot of confusion involved with the number of flavors that naturally are a red color cherry strawberry watermelon and raspberry all are sort of naturally reddish but they wanted to be able to sell all of these flavors and sometimes within the same pack so they had to find a way to distinguish between the four of them the first obvious solution was to make watermelon a sort of lighter pinkish the way that actually looks on the inside of the watermelon and to make strawberry and cherry varying degrees of medium and darker red but that left raspberry initially the first thought was to make raspberry a sort of really dark wine red but the dye that they used to achieve that color was banned by the FDA for causing reactions and for being a possible carcinogen so not good so then came the idea for blue dye no other known flavors were blue yet so why not but it didn't just decide to do this out of nowhere they then decided to base the flavor that raspberry would be on the white bark raspberry or blue raspberry this is a less common species of raspberry that's a lot more purpley blue in color and actually has a texture much more like a blackberry they then combined this flavor with a bright blue dye called brilliant blue which went on to become the bright blue color and flavor that we no one loved today as blue-raspberry from there it caught on in popularity and went on to become a staple in candy flavors and it solved the red flavor conundrum so I'll admit the color associated with blue raspberry that we're used to isn't really anywhere near the color of the actual blue raspberry themselves but it doesn't mean that blue raspberries don't exist so there you have it she who taketh away also giveth we may never have really had pterodactyls but blue raspberries can be ours forever go forth turn your tongue blue thanks for watching and I'll see you next time and hope you're not mad at me anymore", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you have a good day bye my youtube channel is sponsored

watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey its Lucky Penny shop and before I get started here we have some exciting news for you there's gonna be a video clip at the end featuring evan tube and a new show called neon arcade so stick around and check that out at the end and now we have some mumbo sours long-lasting sour candies and the flavors are orange strawberry lemon raspberry fruit chews and you can see now it's green mamba sour with green packaging part of our green st. Patrick's Day series selected from orange strawberry lemon raspberry okay so it's a selection and there's three six-packs in there I'm looking forward to we recently did a video with a candy whistle maker and we did some mambas in there and I put kept hauling two Mambo's I think I kept thinking hey Mambo all right let's get to these and check them out so we have three we have the rasp berry the limo and strawberry let me open up each pack and we'll take a closer look at them one stack and two stacks looking mighty tasty here and then stack number yes my mouth my mouth starts to water I know I say that a lot but when you start opening candies and smelling the flavors knowing that you're about to get a sugary treat mmm okay first of all the resp berry just kidding I'm just kidding let's open that one there then the lemon and then de strawberry let me turn that down just a little now these are very light colors I might look like because they are very light alright so let me try this one first so you're gonna hear some chewing noises and maybe I don't know we'll see what other noises we hear I'll try to be quiet I like Mama's it's a different shoe that other similar candies there's a little more resistance to it look at the pack looks like little seeds very tasty right here we go as far as sour I'm gonna say very low on the sour level now the lemon that one's got little spots all over - so here's what it is see it's like a if you watch the video the toot sweet video that came out earlier last week earlier this week I take these and I make whistles out of them with our toots week maker so it's able to almost like shape them in my hands soften them up and shape them like a whistle lemony flavor between the two right the raspberry better all right mouth is watering very tasty that's a very nice consistent flavor that's why strawberry now strawberries probably my least favorite flavor in any candy so here it is soft look at that here we got last one it seems as though I start trying chewing on the right side then move it to the left side what side of your mouth you chew on and what candy or do you eat candies differently mmm okay between three this one's my favorite I think it's the most accurate flavor hmm okay enough lean in I mean there was that one there was that one and then the last one was lemon and I totally destroyed all my packaging it happens so there's the three in the mambas did I say Mambo again I can't tell I forget sometimes 18 Fruit Chews and if you want to see more candy videos like this look at the description and Mama fans

Kevin are you trying some fun candy these are Slurpee this is spray candy and then Kevin has a spray any right or no twisting look Matt's right I just spray this is like it whistle laughing it's like a sucker and this one is a lollipop with candy powder these were from 7-eleven mich Mich got once they were a dollar each at 7-eleven and mich Mich is in michigan and so they they have their 7-eleven there this is Louie got spray candy blue raspberry it says okay so okay I wonder if you have to shake it made in China okay you think mm-hmm nice um tart it is heart very tart blueberry I don't understand school yeah squirt can be that is extremely strong what's weird is it but basically what they've done is they're taking the Slurpee syrup and they put it in that container what's bad about it is it doesn't aerosol out it doesn't go you know it's like a stream your strains like oh well like you got a water hose and so it hits your back your mouth and it says this is only at 7-eleven I wonder what would happen right in the dog's mouth you can spray it on the thing you can just kind of show how it comes out coming it though yeah if it's gonna get all this light though I don't think you're gonna be able to see them to make sure it's very like I'm gonna expect the darker color to happen I think kids would like this to dare each other I'm troubled are very interested yeah 15 squirts well Tommy can do 20 yeah that's why I think but it needs to miss instead of the string this is cherry fruity panting and I've just like oh it's like a salt shaker but it's a shaking lick or something like it quits and what Winston there's book though you twist this no twist that you twist that off in lick what I'm smelling the leg that I'm saying I like this twist I think I'll know I don't know I think something twist twist twist for the whole thing off okay so it was meant to come off well I thought it came off awfully easy hopefully we're doing this right it looks like a plastic salt shaker oh the whole bottom two terms it's that twisted this one I'm assuming it supposed to be pushing something up this reminds me of that we had some Mexican candy like this do you remember that baby it was like guava or something in there look at all this more it's very hard to twist a little kid wouldn't be able to do that although I like the flavor of them it's almost like God it's seeping out well you gotta back it off you got untwist it well I'm twisting it I want it to come out mmm I like that it's hard very hard to it it's that's good it's a hard key so it'd be it'd be hard for a young kid to do that you probably have to be consoling like if Gavin had man mm-hmm he would not be able Twitter yeah we even hate that because I actually hurt Ryan cuz you would have to literally give that here dad I'm ready for another leg and you have twisted form but it's really good at that this guy kind of kind of gummy kind of texture yeah sugary like Chris boys yes it's very very add know so that sorry I like Alan Berta goons oh I like that a lot yeah okay no this is gonna be a sucker and work we're not gonna share this sucker well we would but we don't want to gross anybody out i think i'm tearing open the wrong side so you get the lid pops all I know and that's around lisandro the suckers inside look there that's not good enough you take that little you paying it it has plastic hold it on okay this says dip and lick Slurpee lollipop with candy power it looks like the top on the slippery with a strong oh you think yes that's cool okay so you take you this off well if I can find the way to do you stab it with the end of the sucker seal for your Praetorian under that actually stinks a gunshot just when I open the house and the dog the dog never moves still storing okay so this has a lot of power to get a sucker bug to this well there's no way said we wouldn't do that flick the bomb it looks like it looks like a toilet plunger I know for me but then now the suckers really good okay so we said we weren't gonna do that way to anyway okay you're just licking the sucker stick it in there like your plunge in the toilet you're thinking no that powder that's a tart tart torque power I mean it I like the sucker don't like the powder and the suckers kind of plying until you put in the powder and it's very very tart it's almost too tall well my favorite out of the flurry oh yeah definitely that is awesome I wish it wasn't so hard to get it up there because it does take some story to get it to him out of there but this is good stuff inside of your flavor I wonder if they make that same I think I've had that same thing you know like a toothpaste tube but it's candy yeah yeah yeah squeezing yes squeezy it's the same thing if you've had that stuff and that's much easier to get out than this so if you're gonna buy you're gonna spend a dollar let your kids spend a dollar as long as they have strong hands or you're willing to do formal yeah then that would be a good one to get so I would avoid this one then we just because it it's just too tart well and I can even go with the flavor food to hear us all out instead of screaming right right so thank you miss miss for sending us some fun candies I'm sure it was fun to watch our blunders so we'll see you next time [Music]", "emTGYvecYPI": "looks smell them they do look different they

because it doesn't taste like yeah ray bailed out well i have to say i definitely like the sour ones the best out of all the peeps even the sweet ones i thought i was gonna like the cotton candy the best and that was probably my least favorite it wasn't very flavored i think the blue ones are the best yeah like the blue raspberry because i don't know maybe if i didn't eat like other people he was

shop product features Lucky Penny shop it's time for some starbursts original Fruit Chews and I like these quite a bit I'm sure a lot of you do out there if you're from the United States you know if you're from other countries have you seen this in your country we're running through some USA candy because you know what a lot of people have been asking we got cherry orange strawberry and lemon I'm swallowing because I'm getting ready to taste the real fruit juice that's what the packaging looks like now the only thing I could say about starbursts is I just don't like having to open each one because it's time consuming once you get in here let me show you get you some colors down here and there you know what my favorite color is I say my least favorite is the pink my favorite is the red so with starbursts you have to basically peel each one and you know what I'm talking about if these get warm in your pocket or somewhere they get really hard and they stick when you peel it off there's one so you'll have to move fast if you want to eat these fast because you gotta peel each individual candy there's two there's three if you've done all the flavors there's four flavors very colorful get the rest out so now I'm gonna eat one of these but I just want to show up to you because once I start eating it's hard to choose so they are you know kind of tough in a way especially if they're cold they're not easy to chew takes a while to get through that initial bite and warm them up so let me let me have one here now it's gonna I know it's going to annoy some people but I can't help it it's just a blast of flavor so good so there you go tell toe LPS Dave I'm opening up one more for you and Lucky Penny shop which one you like let's get a vote going huh what's your favorite

for the entire pack we got these for 60 cents at my I don't know if it was because that was a special because of what they were or what so they might have 60 cents and the flavors on it says grapefruit tastes real fruit juice the flavors are strawberry lemonade chill citrus slush cherry splash and blue raspberry rush which to me is probably the same flavors as always in here and they just so 200 it was a 240 coughs for the entire package you get a lot of starburst for 240 calories I'm gonna cut it on the plate so you get three blue ones and three orange three red and three of the pink ones so I'm gonna try I'm gonna cut these in half so I can get to any one of them or half one I'm gonna try that one first so good there's what it looks like typical starbursts same texture is a regular starburst these are new I'm assuming that was the citrus slush this tastes like a one today it's like orange it's softer every soft there something I remember I don't need is the orange always that orange II that tastes like an orange yeah it tastes like let's see which one let's try the do the math on that actually there's 12 in the package in there how many calories for 240 for the whole thing 20 20 calories each which one the product strawberry yeah yeah so we Kevin and I are having 10 calories each because we're having Ashley gets tired of hearing about our I plan eating something bigger later on tonight I think that tastes just like normal a little bit different just not enough to matter almost like a bubblegum flavor I don't think I like it as much as the regular every there well lemonade yeah I can't believe that has a limit that's a little bit of that lemonade yeah I like the pink and I like the pink in the regular package better than that because usually that's one of my favorite flavors and that's not that tasty a certain type of bubblegum blue blue blue what is this good well you know thing that is just very very strong that's very strong it's sweet but it is very strong I don't yeah I would give that away yuck I don't yeah it's pretty strong actually it's gonna excuse herself you're you gonna you're not gonna eat it go chip go spit it out with our bags and then come back if you don't want it and what do we have here this is the cherry one cherry berry I think your tongue is blue wash definitely carry no that was pretty good actually that's probably the best one for me in the package taste like the grim little cherry I wouldn't get that I wouldn't get those again um I think honestly I like the cherry one you know like I actually like the pink one the eliminate one didn't like the blue one too much really didn't care for the orange one also this is to oranjee from I really have just the regular flavors yeah yeah definitely I'm not bad if you want a little different you know yeah if you want to be different than that's okay but I would I would stick to the regular starbursts and actually you would too you", "MX6p8mXdAG8": "[Music] we want

we're gonna try it and see what it tastes like we'll be able to try I ever get the wrapper open we get this wrapper opening hold on guys we're gonna get this wrapper open okay guys we got this wrapper open and whew you could smell the blueberry opens up and opens up like that and then it's pretty cool the way that container opens up like that and then you can ya the individual pieces of gum in

to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "vGOYds0MKpE": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and Jake is making candy today and we're gonna ask the question where did the idiom blowing a raspberry come from because it seems to have nothing to do with raspberries but it does these fruit drop rollers are a little different than most of the ones we have you see these raspberry rollers are asymmetrical the top and bottom are distinctly different and they create the top and the bottom of the raspberry and this is cool because when you put one of these in your mouth it kind of feels like a raspberry because you get that 3-dimensional shape you don't even realize you're connected with it this is sort of like the strip effect that we covered in our video number 73 and while I found studies that cover flavors and colors with this strip effect I haven't found any that covers texture so I find these interesting the flavor and color was added when the candy was in the pot but Jake now sprinkles on some citric acid that'll give it just a little tang and make it taste more raspberry like I've always been fascinated with words and the origins of them and sometimes words can be confusing so let me give you three words to think about entomology etymology and entomology etymologies of course the study of bugs etymology is the study of words and entomology is the study of snack cakes and while the third study might be useful we're going to concentrate on the second study and go back to the origin of blowing a raspberry because it has a fascinating story one that takes British television British censors American TV and the paranoia of movie studios all together to add a term to the English language that's an unusual term in the first place so while Jake flips the candy to even the temperature and lets it drip he needs to get it all to the right consistency to go through the machine clearly let's go back to the early days of television television was on unlike the early internet it was struggling for content it could make some but it needed more than it could make and the movie studios in the United States were not being cooperative they were scared of television they were afraid it was going to destroy their business so they didn't want to license them their blockbusters they did license the monster movies that they thought they'd never show again like two Creature from the Black Lagoon which will be in another video by the way and they also did old old films like ah The Three Stooges Laurel and Hardy and our gangs sometimes known as The Little Rascals but what they ended up doing was leaving an opening but American television found a solution that was England you see the British film companies didn't see a threat from the American film companies in post-world War two and for many years after that people in the United States got their first real exposure to British movies and it was a good one and we absorbed accents we considered the British accent cool I think it paved way to the British revolution in music and the acceptance of it here in the United States but it also added words to the lexicon and one of them was blowing a raspberry that sound that you make when you're disappointed with things sometimes known as the Bronx cheer the writers in British films started using terms like blowing raspberries because there were censors in the British film system and there were pretty major cutting things out these sensors were originally employed during World War two to censor letters movies to keep information from going to the enemy but after the war they found a job the censoring films for the public's quote-unquote protection and the directors and writers found this stifling so they try to get around this by putting things in the censors didn't know but the public might and one of the things they used was London rhyming slang sometimes known as cockney rhyming slang if you're not familiar with it it's two words that rhyme with another to confuse the upper classes and the police so table and chair would mean stair but you wouldn't say table and chair you just say table you'd have to know stair to get to chair and for another example is frog and toad being rode well there you had a term raspberry tart but if you think for a second you might be able to figure out what raspberry tart rhymed with fart so because London used rhyming slang in people knew it the movies could use it to get around the censors in England when the movies came to the United States that were shown on American television because the television companies couldn't get American movies and a term entered the English lexicon that meant the term that the sound blowing a raspberry makes and I loved it came full circle there's the Golden Raspberry award that now gives awards for bad movies and the name of that award is the same linguistic origins as the name for sticking your face in a baby's belly and making a funny noise that makes it laugh and if you haven't figured it out already there's a reason why these candies are called drops

cool glitter on the case itself pretty neat so I'm going to gently take off the entire label and in another video you'll see why okay now it's time to open up the case and here is a bubble tape you can kind of see some darker blue speckles in the tape that's a lot of gum isn't it and with the case you can snap off a piece of the gum you okay on to the tangy tropical bubble tape the tape itself is this cool or G yellow color I really like it it's very pretty okay after trying each bubblegum I'd say I like the tropical berry level take much better than the sour blue raspberry just my opinion they're both good but the tropical one is better okay thank you for watching yeh toy unboxing make sure you check out my other bubble tape videos I have a few of them now and also subscribe so you don't miss any news videos okay bye guys you", "U_117vY6qjo": "today Kevin are maybe trying some Smuckers simply fruits i have the concord grapes red raspberry and we're trying because Leslie recommended them to me thank you very very much Leslie they were easy to find they were a Walmart the raspberry was 247 the grape was 228 I have no idea whether it was 26 different than them that's just Walmart pricing I don't know why I guess what makes them different is simply fruit is that they are sweetened with fruit syrup from apple pineapple or pear juice concentrate they are only 40 calories for one tablespoon so we're going to try the grape first that wasn't bad awesome the top collects off jelly these are jellies run yes well it spread a lot fringes Breville right right there we go I got a little a little too much because it is the CC pre-press bro it is his bread hmm the grape-flavored doesn't hit me right at first yeah it was like a 2% right but then it it's very good mmm just a good break oh I like that what it's not like great anyone it's not sweet overpower my sweet as them it's a regular jelly but it is really a hit a good flavor do you want I like that and I know that Leslie watches her calories I'm pretty sure she does so I can understand why you would buy this and it's cheap and it's good and all of come on 140 calorie count it's Breanna that's right exactly and then jelly a deleted I'm I'm trying to even think okay you've open this one I'm going to know what the same I know I've got some strawberries I have to work red raspberry jam so okay 50 super-heroes this red raspberry this is seedless as well and it has this is jam but it has 50 calories so a huge difference but ten calories I mean if you a lot of people count calories a lot of people are going to catch you know the money healthier for - I don't know what tomorrow oh that's true if these are yes I just flicked that out on the table yeah we'll just leave that right thank you for look like it has anything weird in it them it looks pretty straightforward but did that one say it's sweetened parchment process with genetic engineering and the red raspberries hyper dust corn syrup okay so I know why people don't want to touch hop through those cones right so these are going to be I'm just licking it's very spreadable long day I can't result if so it is going to be healthier for you yeah I've just made a mess that's okay so here's the red raspberry sound of solar flares in degree mm-hmm it does I like it better mm-hmm to the grape is good but there was something like missing with the grape plays a lot the great wasn't a snare a strong those little red raspberry you get a much stronger fight we're not look in the green sea be seen and weird brief syrup red raspberries the lemon juice concentrate fruit pectin natural flavors red grape juice concentrate added for color so so this one does the hopper does one sorry yeah red raspberries high-fructose corn syrup corn syrup fruit pectin and citric acid so it's a it's it's sweetened with with a natural right sweeteners so these are whoops that's good yeah very good I am very happy that you recommended this to me they're very very good I do like the raspberry we thought the raspberry better than the grape uh yeah I'm great yo mamma great but it's just not a strong and over other flavors - oh yeah they had all kinds of flavors these were just the two that I picked because I already had a bunch of jam and the refrigerator that I'm working my way through and because Josh was nice enough to send us a bunch and so I've been working my way through those and so I didn't want to buy a bunch of these as well so I just chose to but now I'm going to work my way through they but they're very very good thank you for recommending them and I hope everyone else can finally you give them a try because they really are good and I think it's great that they're they don't have a lot of high fructose corn syrup in them so I will see you next time [Music]", "ZlZuX9zaZmE": "today Kevin an eighth or not already try some Welch's fruit cups these were 349 about at Jungle Jim's I have this Concord grape strawberry and I have to mix the berry so we're going to go to Strawberry first these are 1 ounce is 110 calories you're always a mixed berry they are so I can't look funny yeah what's is there though these did they all gluten-free yeah pretty little preservatives for sanitary kosher dairy yeah okay I kind of think the shape on there now okay these are the strawberry the way right here you know they're almost hard there's one a bit hard it definitely gets rubbery but it's a manufactured program yeah I'm coming it's definitely not legit when I first went in my mouth I thought it was gonna be a funky flavor but then it kind of grew on me so the funkiness ruin yeah I don't know you notice I didn't get another one to see what I go oh yeah that's very flat right leg right Mandarin why you're opening up this is Concorde right once again very brittle again chemically I just had a peanut butter jelly interesting it actually reminds me of their Concord grape jelly the belches I don't mind the breaks listen this is mix very well it's like a war pretty devil yeah like um there's a tartness in there that I don't like oh right there at the end mm-hmm you get the tart it smell like you ate up like it chewed up a pill I don't mind those but I don't necessarily like them enough to buy them you know welcome if you keep you know I know kind of good now that's like you have a plan that's what I'm saying about the strawberry I think if I ate more I would I would start to like them a little bit more but I think they're the strawberry is there's a funkiness when you my favorite one it's a call for great about except zero stars who are having you and I don't want to drop her eight in one of each I'm done one cup I don't know I think it would be a good low calorie snack I personally would not buy any other great low calorie snack to me did you win how would they I think yeah I wouldn't buy any of them but I this is something that you're just gonna have to try they're a little hard they're not like a that was sugar coating all right we're softer they might be they might win over a little more points with me if they were like a puff yeah there are they're brushing and I just yeah like a cheese puffs you can sink your teeth into and that's gone yeah I brushed it one go right these are saying fruit puffs so I expected something to be so close be like a little cereal in the ball very very crunchy no these kind of mommy of cereal honestly they're gonna I think up I was like it feels like I'm eating a piece of cereal yeah those were dissolved nothing milk probably would the grape is the best one out it's the best one if you're gonna spend the 349 I would got the grape and maybe three feet to you Bay I gotta love it well just brand-name yeah yeah so I'll have a picture of these free thin so you can see a close-up and thanks for watching [Music]", "AwrjUAUWyow": "i think i think the internet agrees that like the sourest candy is toxic waste and what do you mean like the toxic waste candy oh i've never even heard it i've never even heard of it i would explain why he but i couldn't find it i went to like eight stores so that we're ranking sour candies readily accessible to the general public prank food where we drink food welcome um we are ranking sour candies today so this was actually an idea suggested by someone on our survey um i don't know who they were but thank you yeah we listen to you um so your input is appreciated thank you random citizen we're gonna be going through eight candies and each of us giving two individual scores one for how sour it is and one for how much we like it taste wise so um i think we should be able to average those scores together and come up with the best sour candy definitively so uh we are going to be starting with the first candy uh we're going to be doing haribo haribo golden bears aren't those the ones that make you sour the sugar-free ones the sugar-free sugar-free ones are the ones that destroy your are the the hellspawn from hell there's a little pucker yo i got a stiff one let me get a different one they're awesome oh really this is gonna be bears for you this feels like it's stronger than it's like it's like a jaw exercise yeah we need to pace ourselves for yourself all the time right you can have them afterwards what's the scale on is it is it to 100 like we did last time or just 10 10 since we've only got like i think just the 10 works okay just to make things simple okay sourness i i give that like a one or a two it didn't feel very sour at all i think some of these are gonna be lower than that so i don't know if you want to start with one or two really yeah i i am sticking to my two yeah i'll stick to two i'll stick to two for sourness i was gonna say four uh flavor wise that was pretty good though i'm giving that like a three or four i'll give it a three for flavor yeah i'm not the biggest fan of gummy bears so i'm gonna give it a three as well i'll do a five i like gummy bears they're good they're good you get a nice jaw workout at the same time all right so that was gummy bears moving on to candy two sour punch straws ooh these are a rainbow i'm taking a blue one because blue blue is the best that kids that's another reason why they only got a three because they didn't have a blue disagreement though when it comes to sour candies yellow is best you gotta get the lemon flavored sour candy these aren't much more sour than the gummy bears i feel maybe what do you think sour wise um three so i think it's just a little bit more than the gummy bears but not by much i think i'm going to give it the same score as the gummy bear i think i'm going to give it a 4. oh no the lemon definitely bumps it up does it oh yeah like a like i said lemon is the best flavor of sour candy oh you're right thank you five okay let's build the road middle of the road sour i'm sticking with the three because they're still not very tower yeah i don't think it's sam you were telling me to bump my numbers up you need to bump your numbers down homeboy he'll be fine flavor-wise i've got five i love sour punch so i'll give that a five would i get bears three i'll also give this a five i like i out of all the things on this table i would go to these more than some of the other ones i would do this one probably a six six okay that's fair wow this is working pretty well middle of the road it's a classic all right sour skittles don't stand by every everybody knows our skills okay the only correct way to judge the sourness of this all along okay that's just our thing we've had so far really okay i was about to say that they don't even feel as sour as our initial kick they are like sour for half a second then it drops so but i'm gonna base it on for how long i'm eating it the sourness okay so if there's an initial kick but then it goes away after the first like suction i'm gonna count that as little suction okay so i'm actually gonna count that as a one to be honest not bad i'm counting it as a one because again you had the initial sour and then it went away that's the only reason though okay we got a video i'm gonna give it a five five just like the sour punch okay mr consistency i'll do a three for that like it's not sour for long but it's got a good sour flavor it has a good kick at the beginning yeah it's an initial initial drop kick to your taste buds and then it's like this is the first of the candies we've had so far that will make your tongue bleed too many of them yeah which is a which is a good indication of that is true that's true flavor-wise i'm going four uh i just like sour punch straws a little bit more than skittles skittles are good i also eat them but after a while i feel like all of our scores are super on the low end but i'm gonna give this one a four okay kind of same same with you like the taste of skittles is good but it kind of gets old real quick yeah like i'll give it a six just because i do like sour skittles but again it's one of those things that if you eat more than a handful or two your jaw is just yeah it becomes a workout and you who needs a workout while you're eating candy like come on everybody but it's beside the point i burnt my tongue last night and all this citric acid is really about right you chose today to do the video yep sam's like ah pain inside my mouth you know what's great sour more pain this will be a nice um break from all the sour candies though what are these again these are double bubble extra sour bubble gum yeah this is crybaby bubblegum here's the blue one for you yes thank you there's the yellow one for you thank you and i'll go with pink is that pink or red i can't tell um it's probably cherry oh yeah memories right these are solid the sour index whoa it stays for longer than skittles i'm still feeling sour it didn't completely disappear but the spike definitely went down you rise out oh that's more than the skittles look at that five i give them this i too will give it a seven okay like that that's a good sour yeah flavor-wise delicious i'll give it a six it's not my favorite thing on the table but it's still like if you're comparing it to other types of gum i'd give it higher but since we're comparing it to different types of sour candy i'll give them to sex i don't like them oh you're dumb i'm giving you two wow after the initial sour flavor go the way it literally just tastes like double bowl yeah that's that's great so three all right uh one two three four halfway three we are halfway through yeah the uh fifth candy is airheads extremes these are these are good these are up there and these are like my one of my favorites just candies in general almost no sour though no all right no like here i'm in the shower yeah does it make sense it has like the taste of sour but not the actual experience of sour one on the sourness you give me a one that's sweet that's not i'll give it a point five i'll give it a three you can't give it a point five i'm giving it a one for you bro flavor is probably like an eight i love this my highest flavor is don't cheat just think okay i'll go i'll go seven seven this is a good flavor definitely one of the tastiest on the table but not if it's like like not if you're looking for something if you want a sour candy don't get that i like how on the packaging it has sour right here and the line is below the sour yeah yeah that is fitting that that's horrible marketing all right sour patch we have sour patch kids and these are not just sour patch these are sour patch kids extreme hopefully they're more extreme than the air his history i mean blue okay that is more than he needs more than i thought i would be giving you there's a little difference i think they're a little bit more sour than regular sour patch kids a little not much i think these are more sour than the sour schools four what did i give sour skittles three sour skittles uh yeah pretty cute you can get it they're not as sour as the skittles in my mind they disagree i don't think i don't think the spike was as much like i don't think it's pink was as sour as the skittles but the sour lasted longer than this guys i'm gonna give it a six you got a very interesting spread here uh flavor wise i'll give it a seven i love sour patch kids i'll give them an eight i was also going to give them eight [Laughter] because these are better than the airheads these are better than the airheads i'll keep these then all right uh the next candy this is a candy that i found at the asian market it's super lemon oh juicy juicy yeah so did we chew these sacraments um it is a super lemon candy inside of a mild lemon candy with lemon taste powder around it oh do we chew it or suck it though i'd say suck it sorry okay that doesn't sound like something i don't it's cause you saw oh mama mia that's a kick i love this that is really good holy cow like that lemon taste powder really crazy this also has the best um design on the packaging ever and you've got a really nice comic on the back of it so it's fantastic showers i give it a nine that was good that was sour i'm gonna give it an eight i don't think it's that sour but it is up there it's a nine for me as well flavor is still really good i've tasted a lot of lemon flavored candies that just are not good that that did the lemon taste really well so i'll give that probably a seven lemon's not my favorite flavor yeah but as far as lemon flavors go that was pretty good so i'll give that a seven i agree also seven i will give it an eight it's not quite as in my mind it's not quite as good of a lemony uh candy it's like the limit head is but it's got a better kick to it yep okay all right and last one last but not least warheads these are the classic oh please give me blue i thought that wasn't blue i tried i tried i did yeah i already know what to expect from this that hurt yes it does it hurt so good 15 10. i shouldn't have gone so high on the other ones that's what i was telling you the whole video 10 for sam brian what about you so sour is a 10. the warhead challenge wasn't a thing for no reason flavor it's honestly not the like the go-to taste they're not great um it's still good though i'll give it a six i'm gonna give it a two that's just because your tongue has been destroyed and you can't taste anything what do you think brown three like like i love sour candy but this is not good candy it's good sour yeah after your the sour fades away it's just a yeah i usually spit it it's just kind of a flavorless hard candy so yeah i think i think toxic waste could have beat warheads if we had gotten access to it but maybe there will be another video if you guys want to see it all right and just so you guys know we did try to find toxic waste it just does not exist i've been to like eight stores trying to find toxic waste but all right so i i think that we we all agree warheads is the the most sour candy and what what one the best freezer is super lemon the tasting one um it was uh sour patch kids sour patch kids won by like one point so it went sour patch kids uh super lemon and air heads were tied and then after that was a tie between the double bubble and the warheads and that was all for flavor that was all for flavor the second spiciest was the super lemon i'm sorry i'm what the second sourist was the super lemon all right so um i i don't know what you learned from this i learned that you guys gave me free candy um i i can't believe we did another candy breaking video after the first one why i don't know um it could have been a lot more but yeah as always thank you for watching hit that like button that subscribe button if you want to see more content and comment below with other video ideas you want to want to see us do because we do listen to you so i don't they do i'm working we'll see you in the next video bye bye well what did you say you said something no he said

focus back in on our pretty faces so it's actually the cameras fault not my fault but anyway so we're just hi I decided to do it in like better lighting and redo it a little bit so you can see it all better see our faces better but this is the Smoky's blackberry I found out that loud pack it's only made with loud pack in California if it's an Oregon or like some other places made with some other distributor so depending where you live changes who makes it kind of so I don't know that makes me wonder if it's like different quality do you want to rip it open do you want to do the honors that's terrible yeah they're like make it okay purplish I know I like it never goes back again thank you how many we having - okay this time we're gonna update all three you're gonna have for for which is

the movies 30 milligrams does the temper better [Music] what would you recommend this oh yeah for sure ten Blake a lot of scale to one detail [Music] recommending this like never or would you recommend this like everyone who smokes weed probably at night yeah because some people can't handle it but if you can't handle it alone these are definitely not or even this everybody yeah see you there go yeah we'll be fine I unpacked some packs of these because the flavors you got terminal anyway good job Smokies good job lab pack a plus or at least an 8.5 co-host which is a very fine I give it I'm working anyway oh yeah I did [Music] so depending on the flavor but overall I think their flavors are really cool and they have a bunch of different options chances are out of all of their options they're gonna like at least one of the flavors yeah that's definitely a good beginner so yeah I'm just quite exciting [Music] so we're gonna take off we can go on a walk and I have a send rest

"ARVSswHjBDY": "you want gummy bears I got gummy bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and

Twinkies I delivered about $3 do you want me to pick us up a box and I said sure I'd love the truck and share it with you guys as well it says that they're golden sponge cake with artificially flavored blue raspberry cream filling and you get ten individually wrapped Twinkies in this box but you can eat two of them is the serving size for 270 calories which is spent 135 each so they also have a strawberry one we're gonna try to find it and Labor Day they're like blue blue there's bottom yeah berry blue there's your package and your 20 you like you can have it if you want and you cut I wanna see the insides here oh wow now let's go ahead and pick up my half somebody smart yeah that is some blue it smells like a regular Queen Wow I can taste that blueberry oven but no it's blue right brick I like that I wasn't I love Twinkies this is everything you know and love about Twinkie still has the basic cream texture and the taste but it has a very distinct blue raspberry kick to it extremely good I would buy these again if not over the original point I like these better these have more flavor madam I was not expecting to like that as much as I do I just didn't think it is good it does say I hate Twinkies and and these I would definitely buy these over a record rinky I still don't like them either I choose other kind of snack cake for 135 calories I would choose other things but if you like Twinkies see what other thing is fantastic about these is the fact that they come individually right even though you said she can have it too you don't have to eat one you don't have anything this is the ones are under 35 calories and you could easily get 5 6 by 10 yeah that's I would choose if I was gonna have some raspberry I would definitely it has a lot of to be honest with you Alice kind of Swedish as well not like twenties but that's good you all gotta try those those are good you", "3xbMPXCv8JE": "[Music]", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "sqXCVGBB1J4": "hello and welcome to start tasting an

obviously Jolly Rancher is their Hershey Company now in 12 ounces you'll have 165 calories fifty two point five milligrams of sodium and you'll have forty six and a half grams of total carbohydrates forty six and a half of which are sugar it is caffeine free and it is sweetened with high fructose corn syrup the ingredients are carbonated water high-fructose corn syrup malic acid artificial flavor sodium benzoate preservative blue one and yellow five and this is a one liter bottle and the only place I've ever seen the Jolly Rancher you know the Jolly Rancher sodas is and I stopped that I don't know what's going on I mean these sodas that's two in a row that have basically that have almost exploded on me I I don't I don't shake these up before I cook it on here they're they're sitting in the same spot for days not being moved and then I slowly walk them over here and take them but you always have to be careful opening soda and I managed to hold off that explosion so yes score one for me so anyway where doesn't say was the only place I've ever seen Jolly Rancher sodas is Kmart that's where I bought this bottle so if you're looking for them check out your local Kmart store now Jolly Rancher hippies I like them never been like I don't try to find them or buy them I've never been like a big fan of them but whenever anyone has given me some ore I've got some in some way I definitely enjoy them I think they have a good flavor so curious to see how the soda translates forgot to smell um no just a light blue raspberry smell um you know it smells a bit like the candy does I don't have to say you know from memory it does taste you know I think I've had the blue raspberry candy and what I kinda remember tasting like this reminds me of that flavor you know this is a pretty of so it's a pretty good blue raspberry flavor I don't know it's not my favorite um it's got a little bit of a it's got a little bit of a bite to it um you know blue raspberry wasn't my favorite flavor of Jolly Ranchers so I'm not that big a fan of the flavor but I think if you do love that flavor blue raspberry Jolly Rancher then you should definitely check out this soda because pretty sure they taste very similar you know and so don't find the flavor to be exceptional but it's pretty good um so I'm gonna put it at three out of five hey that's a good spot Kmart has more of these Jolly Ranchers servers and I plan to do more of them what is your favorite Jolly Rancher flavor let me know in the comments on YouTube run sort of tasting calm and you know I will probably just go with one of those favorites for the next Jolly Rancher soda that I do if you're on Facebook or Twitter or Google+ sort of tasting has profiles there and it'd be awesome if you liked followed or circled sort of tasting on those sites you can find links at soda tasting calm thank you for watching and as always everything in moderation I'll see you next time", "mOyHB3PnONA": "today Canada are gonna be trying to totally random different products I just I had a boat back on the shelf and they're both new to me so I wanted to try these are the server's sweet and sour and I do not remember how much I paid for them actually I think I bought a service station and they don't give me a receipt and the hubba hubba bubba hi Koko gum was $1.00 money at Target and I know that it was back with the stocking stuffers it's actually a really cold bank if you want to have a bank for your kid let's try the exposure okay new Starbucks sweet and sour 240 calories for the entire package they have sweet strawberry sour green apple sour cherry and sweet blackberry why'd you do that what'd you do that leave it to scare me you our date okay that's country Kevin yeah I didn't say shame on you you smell you thought it in your head you're right sour cherry right yes how they don't kind of sour what no two or sweet you did not listen to me that yeah you're applying it like a little kid - or sweet into ourselves you should split on these oh okay I'll take a picture of it for the end without remember and I really like to have a picture of the pictures of the end up close pictures that's true mm-hmm that's hard a good way though too sour it is sour there when I hear other sour when next the other sour one is green apple okay sour cherries are green apple and then sweet strawberry and sweet blackberry I didn't mind that cherry at all it was sour and it was cherry there's not much more you can say about that I didn't mind it though I'm still wrong this reminds me of those suckers you made and the ones with the gammon middle blah blah it's very very sour don't like the blow poppy you've had the great love off I think that's it come in has an apple flavor to it but the sourness just ruins it for me the sourness really overruns up it's not even a sour that's like a fun sour like a sour candy like a warhead or something which is our kind of sound like that's fun those are sour at the beginning but then once you get past the powder on the outside you've got a really good tasting candy right that you just get the sour all through it kind of reads the whole thing and you can't enjoy any of this this tastes just like what it always yeah it's just a burger that's not new strawberry that's my favorite one in the regular package they haven't changed that one back no that's the same no blackberry I don't think I've ever had like yeah that's delicious but I mean strawberry's been my favorite for years and years and years I always eat the pink ones first and then the red ones but I also like the lemon ones mmm do you immediately get that Blackberry flower yeah yeah that's good though I don't like it as much as the strawberry but that's good sorry but then I got a phone call so would you buy these again or not no well first of all the the strawberries the sign of strawberry we had never had the blackberry the byberry was really good I would say put that in with the rec room it's probably if you body's regularly thing come in with the regular thanks if they don't they should they're really good they're really good but the cyber ones you know you're getting half of them or sour half a more sweet have over sour it's not worth buying to us for the sour that kids might really like you all might run you like you like the milk I didn't matter but I would rather have regular rubber if I won't serve her : the ones with the orange and the lemon I like those better all right this is hubbub of a hot cocoa and we can't share God how come but in that that's it's pretty small piece one piece is 15 calories which sugar-free gum is only like three counties so yeah this is not very big piece goodness gracious that is like a miniature miniature and that is 15 calories so when you got all these I've often wondered when you see these packs at the counter at Walmart when you're checking out they don't tell how many hours are on there the hubba bubba oh yeah they don't have calories on them so just think those are like double the size of this so you're pregnant a little at least 30 calories that a piece of guy time I used to beckon there when I was a kid hubba bubba commercials they always take it squeeze it and was really soft this is not fossil salt how many pieces do you get for a dollar I know there's our chocolate 12 12 pieces for two hours mm-hmm it's all this like chocolate it's pure chocolate it's good it's weird it's not something that I would want all the time no but it's a novelty it's something it's something different again it's different in for a stocking stuffer or something like that I would be cool I love how soft it is yeah it's very soft what I remember like I'm used to like just sugar free trot out that's all I chew is trot out this is really really tough it's a little weird though having the chocolate flavor and the squishiness mm-hmm little strange but it is really a chocolate yeah not quite chocolate milk chocolate more like yeah just a hunk of chocolate more like going towards a hot no I mean a dark chocolate chocolate but not yeah not bitter who this but I don't know why new without why no it's not somebody wants you all at home not bad don't forget I can Bob out this hot cocoa yeah yeah yeah I can bother this hot cocoa so honestly not above these as adults we wouldn't bomb but I do think that would be cool to get give you a buff I like you guys yeah because and you can't find this year-round you can't buy this is something cold and I even think for a kid these would make a good stopping it's ever yes that we wouldn't bother yeah I would Percival again right yeah poor kids kind of kids would like them right so I hope you enjoyed getting to see all this and thanks for watching", "Ue5Kk_UsSbw": "[Music] hey guys it's Brandi with green wellness life I am here today to chat with you about a new line that we've decided to carry a cream on this life from koi that's koi like the fish koe they've got a pretty broad range of products including topicals lots of vapes tinctures as well and we've started by carrying just a few of the options to see when people think of them so this product line is new for us we would love to hear your feedback love to hear what you think they do have a few things going for them that are unique that that's one of the reasons that we decided to start carrying this product it's apparently Wild Kingdom day in my house today because I've got a cat fully distracted so here we go this is normal see people alright let's start with the tinctures we've chosen to carry the koi Naturals tinctures and orange flavor they also have a lemon line and then they also have a line that has not considered their natural so what makes it natural you say well they've not added any color into it and they're not using any artificial flavors so that is what makes its eligible to be in their Naturals line so we're carrying their t-shirt their orange t-shirt in two strengths a 500 and a thousand milligrams both of the bottles are gonna look like this little cutesy black frost and bottles and they've got the same ingredient list so they've got the full spectrum CBD natural orange extract and coconut oil so again a lot of our products do contain MCT or coconut oil as the base so that's something to be mindful of if you've got a coconut sensitivity definitely reach out if you want to to avoid that otherwise it's a great healthy oil to add into our bodies so one thing that is unique about koi and one reason we decided to carry out is that they utilize a process that manufactures a full spectrum oil with zero THC so you might have heard me talk about isolate before where the CBD compound is ice and added in to a product one they do the opposite they isolate the THC and yank it out so they're leaving him the rest of the full spectrum the plant matter and the other cannabinoids that are naturally occurring in hunt plants they leave it all there so that's pretty cool they've also figured out how to make it taste decent so with the tincture you're just gonna shake it up and then measure it out so we talked a lot unfortunately this one does not have a measurements on the pipette boo we wish that everybody did because boy wouldn't that make serving sizes a little easier and we talked in terms of full drops full droppers so when you press and release the bulb top here you can see I think you can see then that's really about three-quarters of the way full it's not all the way full but that's considered a full dropping your full dropper rather you're gonna get about forty of those out of each and B is one ounce bottles so on a 500 milligram we do that math handy-dandy calculator take 500 divide it by the forty servings at a full dropper pool which really looks like more like 3/4 you're gonna get about 12 and 1/2 milligrams of CBD so that is a reasonable middle of the road starting serving size if you find you want to step it up then you could always look at going to the thousand milligram because then you'd be getting more like 25 per dropper again zero THC otherwise full spectrum this is the orange mmm it smells in it taste it's actually really good they've done a nice job of adding a flavoring that compliment that hemp flavor and really controls it so the orange is really nice that is Charlie that is moseying around the table no worries we never actually eat at the dining room table it's strictly for show okay moving on we've also carried the koi gummies gummies have a little bit high price point per milligram of CBD we get a lot of requests for them and I was pretty Costin to carry them there was a company with a similar name to ours that was manufacturing some gummies that were not terrific and putting people on monthly reorder programs so we got a lot of calls for them when we were initially in business thankfully they have disappeared and we've had a lot of requests for gummies so we did decide to carry them I'm in my opinion a Gumby is a good booster I got occasional if you if you just need that quick boost of CBD it's not something I would include daily as a supplement the price points not great and then quite frankly it's a gummy so it's got all of the stuff in it that you would consider a gummy to be it does have gelatin so this is not a vegan product something to keep in mind does have artificial colors what they have done though in is that a lot of companies just kind of dust the CBD on the top and they actually use it all the way in the gummy so they believe that to be a better product I will tell you I have eaten a lot of gummies too many guys and these are actually really good so they taste good and I have noticed that if I'm struggling a bit in the day then they do give me the boost that I'm looking for so good product good occasional booster if you will to add into your daily regimen if you're looking for coming we're also carrying the Kois soft shoes the price point again on these is a little high it's higher than some of the other dog treats that we carry we're kind of talking about this for the picky pups so these are nice and soft and meaty they are pretty small two and a half milligrams of CBD per juice and you've got a big dog keep in mind that you'd be giving them a few of them but the dogs really like them kara that I work with she has a great day have a seat Lily oh good dog she has a Great Dane named Molly that will not touch any of our other pet products this is a serious dog snap not interested and she goes crazy for these helps if I show them so you got a picky eater that you're looking to add some meaty into their regimen this might be a good fit for you 25 choose about two point five milligrams of CBD per chew and they really like them Lily is enjoying hers camera right now okay then we move into the e-liquid quois got lots and lots of you liquids to choose from we chose two flavors and two strengths as a starting point something to keep in mind when you're buying a bottle a liquid which is what these are they're not in a cartridge form and they're not disposable these are bottles so keep in mind how many tanks you're going to be getting out of that bottle for example this is the koi a thousand milligram this is the blue the flavor of the blue I don't know if you can see that but it's blue raspberry and dragon fruit that is the flavor of this one this is a traditional a liquid in a bottle which means it does contain VG it does contain a PG so vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol if you're someone who's concerned about those ingredients and it's not something you would want to add they really like Italy everything smells plus I'm not usually home during the day so I think that it's an added benefit any you not really okay these do have VG and PG in them which means that you get that nice big smoke and a nice smooth vaping experience they taste wonderful but these are not the natural signs they do contain some artificial flavors they are a little stronger that as I was mentioning before I got distracted is you have to keep in mind how big new tank is and how many tanks you're gonna get out of it so the tanks that we carry and sell are just little guys these are a point 5 ml is the line where you're going to fill it up so this is a 30 ml bottle so you're gonna get sixty tanks so again if we grab our calculator and do our math this is a thousand milligram CBD bottle right so if we're gonna divide that if I get my calculator to work that'd be super so I was a milligram bottle we're gonna divide it but we're gonna see how many of the tanks we can get so we'll know how much our thousand is so we know 30ml bottle 0.5 milliliter tanks so that's gonna fill this little tiny tank that we carry 60 times so a thousand milligrams in a bottle divided by six seriously 16 so when we've got some of our high-strength cartridges that we carry from other manufacturers that are about 250 milligrams per tank this is going to be about 16 milligrams per tank so something to consider that it's not going to be nearly as strong with that set these do taste wonderful and they've ate really really nicely so if you're someone who really likes that traditional CBD vape no nicotine know th team wants it to taste delicious and sweet like candy then this is a good fit but if you're looking to stay away from VG or PG then I wouldn't go this route or if you're looking for something that's going to be really strong to me then this isn't going to be a great thing for you between this and my animals that apparently need all the screen time in the world I think that's where we are going to wrap it up we are here and available if you've got questions concerns anything that we can help you with that's what we're here for so our email is support at green wellness Life come again that support at Green Lomas life.com can always call us at eighty eight seven seven to seventy eight seventy five thanks so much make it a great day [Music]", "CyikLuf6MF0": "[Music] [Laughter] exhale my name is Michael James and I care and I'm Luke aka Walter League and today we are reviewing our has two flavors I've not tried before this is blue raspberry and grape have some great crack both good flavors yeah good eye Brasserie the same as blueberries just the Americans call it blue raspberry no I'll tell you the reasons I've tell your story behind me raspberries and sight raspberry has been a popular flavor in candy for a long time and the reason that blue raspberry is a thing and not just raspberry is because when candy makers made candy with strawberry and raspberry and they wanted something to because they're both the same color red okay they won't get something that will tell us it then what's on blu-ray yeah sure yeah oh my god that's not  divine that does smell pretty good me that's most tremendous like much puppy on steroids yeah that does not like slush puppy oh  it buy it right this is going okay I kind of wish I hadn't eaten the whole thing now very chewy hmm um edit this yeah how about I remember them having quiet abstractly it's got great texture huh no it's like had like a really soft Cuba yeah so I can light in Calgary yeah slightly powdery one bar almost kind of things I kind of show you balls rather than cheering yeah precisely which is bring episode listening to us just salivate all over these things all right my lovely tongue hey blue no ha ha ha Harley Quinn tongue going on don't think happily um yeah pretty nice oh yeah I like this good sweet pretty artificial tapetum but in a good way yeah like a lot of motion sweets they are just full of just sugar any numbers essentially but good I like it yeah I'll probably give that one like four spots and a half cuz I say one of my favorite two bars in terms of texture and flavor try the way this smells I love both great everything dude one of my favorite places could you smell that yeah when I was younger I went to America quite a bit just like South American family and stuff and great was one of those flavors I still tried when I was really young and it took a while for us to get over here so soon flavor I was associated with America's don't quite rare over here and get Welch's purple grape juice yeah that's about all wasted asking great grain don't repel you seen that sketch no I've had heard of it choking on my own saliva now if you haven't seen it it's about a black child in a group of white children and they say the references are sunny - I admire how the white kid opens the door to the fridge sees all the sunny light and all the white kids like oh my god Sunny D so needy and yeah black kids just that bad but just at the background it's probably Saul so it's probably quite racist coming from a white person but it's Dave Chappelle back yes that's fine then you're paraphrasing him that's why yeah I'm probably that's fine Adam not my chest before you're shy I'm at least possible racist person here thanks thanks I'll cut that out that's that that's an old quote his native said it was Nate Ghazi and I review and her name said I'm probably the least abrasive platon here and I said well can we all just please be 0% it's nice when Ghazi says whoa I like a calmer and I regularly drink ka drinks yeah literally the least racist person on this cart right this second I like a coma and I drink ka dreams regularly there are the mandem on the street even ordering them what's the man the man dem on the street drinking you're just giving me mystery after mystery how completely man dem is a is a street person okay you're bi say black person you know this just shows how middle-class and white I am I don't understand any of the street level I don't know I think rad is still a cool word maybe yeah they could say rad now yeah probably yeah um this is not quite as good okay I don't quite like as much I said I like it more just a great one of my favorite flavors yeah we should probably back trophy I love the flavor just a me yeah I'll give that one a very very very high three stars I'm gonna say four and a half again because it's all just sugar in a slight bit play you ever say we got fireworks for me what do i favorite G bars do bar people go yeah I said do bars yeah great now we're anti-semitic as well great brilliant well maybe we'll be like the next PewDiePie yeah that's to do them that not a yeah I don't need or spec we're just quoting PewDiePie yeah but copy you can't be a Hitler person yeah somehow thank you very much

dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "1gFJGrXgPVc": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some salt water taffy this is a liquid candy I've never

anymore now but we love their shamrock shake so we're gonna make the healthier version of the shamrock shake tonight for st patrick's day and then we also thought we would do another fun one we've been looking and eyeballing this recipe for a while yeah because cali she loves a good chewy candy she really does and she loves starbursts so we came across a strawberry it's supposed to be lemonade starburst fruit a super fruit super fruit food chew that is a tongue twister kelly can you say it better than i can starting lemonade limeade superfood chews hot you did better than me so we're going to make a couple of things for you and we're going to get started so kelly should we get started on the shake first do you want to shake first we'll do our green saint patty stay shamrock shake first i'll get some you want to grab the blender okay callie's going to get the blender just just the top no just the top yep yep okay bring it on over we can always go over there mix all righty so miss kelly you want to grab the ice i think we'll put the ice in the there's a bottom full in there yep so we've had this shamrock shake a few different ways sometimes we add chocolate and make it chocolate mint but tonight we're just gonna stick with the traditional shamrock shake i can't see any hold on let's see if we can get our comments nope we can't see any comments and it's not really showing us anything tonight so we don't know if we're having a technical glitch or not but can you say hello just so we know that our comments are working we're going to do six ice here should we double this recipe do you think we should share with your brothers and your dad okay okay so let's maybe double it these shakes are always huge i think doubling it will still give us lots so say a quick hello if you can hear us because we can't seem to see the comments right now i'm not sure it doesn't seem to be working well so yeah let's do 12. let's do 12 cubes so we're doubling the recipe for the sandbox shake so this shamrock shake is the low carb mint milkshake from brianna thomas so you can find it on her website and we will um post a link in the card somewhere oh the comments are working hello nice to see you thanks for commenting three four five six seven and we're being very precise tonight eight okay i'm gonna get your spinach ready okay so we're gonna put in a whole bunch of spinach to make a green you're daydreaming while you're doing that do you have a tough day long day at school maybe zoning out all right so we are gonna get the spinach ready hi julia um so we are going to put in so it's supposed to be one cup of loosely packed spinach but we're going to put in enough for two so two cups do you want to grab a measuring cup i'll grab a measuring cup you throw the ice away how's that done oh dear okay so we're gonna do some loosely packed we get a little generous on our spinach and our cheeks we really like having spinach on our shakes like you don't even notice you don't even know what's there right we had a chocolate hazelnut shake last night with supper it was kind of a strange color because of the spinach but that's all right we didn't mind right oh no okay two cups of spinach callie do you want to grab the almond milk yep yeah grab it grab the open one yeah that sounds good is this a open one nope i got it how much do i need you're gonna need we're gonna double again so you're gonna need it says half a cup so you're gonna need one cold cup you wanna just use this one that we've got out you might as well keep rolling with it [Music] can't join um what's that we gotta use until we can't anymore did you give it a shake good job i shook the other one oh you shook this one i think you're gonna need both i think you need both we kind of have a weird angle going here tonight yeah there we go until we get the tripod how is everybody doing on this st patrick's day anybody having green food our kids had green lunches they had uh spinach in their waffles for their school lunch so they had green waffles and they had micro greens and they had celery and green peppers was a real green lunch for school today any more this one's really fully let me give you a hand yes okay so how much did i say we were going to need one cup right once it's pretty like much like three quarters it's pretty close we might have to add some more depending on how thick this ends up okay cali next up the cottage cheese cheese you want to grab that yep all right callie's getting the cottage cheese i love the cottage cheese in these shakes because it is the perfect way to imitate ice cream in this shake so this is like a milkshake this one so you need the cottage cheese the traditional shamrock shake is actually ice cream based if you look at like ones that are not tma to thm they are actually ice cream based usually so i'll need a cup of this are you gonna need a cup actually that says a third so you're gonna need two thirds of a cup sweetie okay all right you got it oh i'll get you a tablespoon it smells interesting so it smells interesting does it smell like cottage cheese hopefully it's not smelling funky okay so you're going to need two for this side if it smells like cottage cheese we're doing the smell test it smells perfectly like cottage cheese to me i don't know what you're smelling but so we're using low fat cottage cheese just because that's what i tend to have in the house did it really callie read further into the recipe than i did apparently well it called for the low fat but this is an s shake so you could go full fat if you have it but i think we just don't want to get too crazy on our calories here with this shake no no need for it we like this one this one um again we've mentioned before we are in canada and we have some phenomenal cottage cheese if you buy the land one percent it tastes excellent if you buy the other one percent brands they're terrible so this is the one that we go with sitter probably be generous we like the cottage cheese in there you want me to hold it up so you can scrape it in get this in view so people can see you in action [Music] how's everybody's wednesday going it's hump day we're almost through the halfway point it is hump day right oh yeah yeah it is wednesday oh boy it's been a long week it's been a long long week one tablespoon mm-hmm keep going all right i'm gonna get the next ingredient ready we're gonna need some heavy cream and we are gonna need again we're doubling the recipe so we're gonna need four tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream you're getting close we're getting it all over the counter i don't care keep going keep it up good it's like the whole container is it pretty much the whole container oh not quite not quite that's looking good okay how about i take this from you and you can scrape that in i'm gonna grab the lid go all right we're going to get this put away [Music] maybe i'm going to wipe up your counter there too uh i'll just put this over here yeah you might need it again we'll find out okay so we're going to need to put in some cream and then do you want to grab the next day you're going to call us oh there we go yeah it's gone that's okay we can't take a call right now anyway next ingredient i'm gonna do the whipping cream so why don't you do the collagen okay okay so going back to this we are gonna need four tablespoons of our heavy cream to give it that nice ice creamy taste you got that that's really a big thing of collagen we love to get that huge thing of collagen at costco sometimes it goes on sale for a really good deal and it's it's really nice i like this one because it dissolves completely whether you put it in hot or cold it's really good at dissolving [Music] it's the organica yeah it's a really good one so i need a two tablespoon you need two tablespoons see if i can find one we need to get some more measuring spoons i feel like every time we do a video we're like we need to get that we need to get that we need to make a list just what we need to do we need to make a profit i think we needed scoops in one video we need measuring spoons there's a few things our kitchen is kind of lacking or some things are just showing their age because they were wedding gifts almost 15 years ago my husband and i all right the kitchen stuff kind of got put on the back burner right replacing all of our gadgets okay it doesn't have to be super precise in a shake you don't have to be quite as precise when you're baking you got to be pretty pretty particular but in a shake it's more forgiving so don't worry too much all right where's everybody watching from tonight yeah we are yeah we want to know this is your first video watching us we are in saskatchewan canada and it's a beautiful day we finally have less temperatures that are significantly on the plus side the snow is almost all melted four teaspoons of this it's awesome today four teaspoons okay we're gonna use this super sweet do you say four teaspoons okay kelly's gonna measure in the fourth because it's normally two teaspoons i'm gonna go ahead with the extracts so we are gonna need vanilla extract and we're also gonna need now it did call this recipe actually calls for dried mint but we don't have dried mint in the house and we don't have a garden going yet in the backyard for fresh mint so we are going to go ahead and just use the pure peppermint extract too bad we didn't have like any mint leaves i know we've done mint before in our pots on our back deck and it's been awesome we did mojito mint the one time and we used that for our kombucha and it was so good newport richly oh nice from florida i bet the weather in florida is nice okay kelly i'm gonna go ahead with this and i'm just gonna i'm gonna do we're gonna start with two capfuls we'll see if that's pepperminty enough and if it's not minty enough for our shamrock shake then we'll increase it we can always increase it but i find the mint is pretty powerful can't take it away you can always put more in and i just got it all over myself it's a good thing it smells good okay i'm gonna wash my hands i'll keep this out because we'll need it do we need it again oh this is the super sweet maybe if it's not sweet enough i guess but i don't like i'm pretty sure we don't need it for our other recipe it's just for this one okay so then we're going to add some vanilla and we're going to go through the dash so we're going to add we're going to be generous i love it okay don't worry about that one right now kelly let's just do this one okay so do you want to do the salt it says pinch so maybe do a cup of cranks like i'm gonna do like one crank well it says a pinch so that would be like one pinch and you're doubling it right perfect okay now we have to add the glucky but we have to do it while it's whirling because otherwise we might get it lumpy this stuff as soon as it hits the anything moist anything wet um it clumps up so badly so we are gonna do that over the thing maybe i should bring it over and we can blend it right up here how's that sound okay okay you guys should check out our youtube channel oh you think everyone should go to youtube yes we do have a youtube channel now and we would love if you go over and you go ahead tell them what it's what it's called i'll get the blender donut and okra donut okra yeah and let's grab this people say ogre's a vegetable and it shows it's seeds so i wonder if it's like a frenchy a fruit or a veggie a fredjie as frenchy as a fruit and a veggie oh you mean because okra has seeds in the inside and cucumbers are a fruit because they have seeds on the inside i don't know we might have to google this whether okra is truly a vegetable or whether okra is a fruit or a veggie is it freddy a true thing yeah i figured this is a made up kelly thing a frenchie a thread or a vegetable whatever it is we love it you could put okra in this shake too but we're just going to stick with the way the recipe is written because the okra would probably be tasted in this recipe but it would certainly give it a really nice puddingy milkshake texture we love the texture of okra in our shakes okay do you want to get this started kelly it's going to be super thick so i'm going to get the plunger it's gonna be loud [Music] we want it to be green it's a shamrock shake it's the perfect green okay if you want to grab a scraper we'll scrape down the sides we have a few little tiny chunks of of cottage cheese and a spinach on the side and that's not going to be very nice yeah you want to scrape down those little pieces of cottage cheese and spinach we might actually have to add some more ice we kind of decreased the ice because our ice cubes are big but we might have to increase the ice we'll see we're going to put that glucky in glooky lucky i still haven't figured out if it's glooky or glucky i'd really like if somebody would tell me if it's glooky or glucky so we could be saying it right or lucky yeah i don't know we said glucky for like two years already so now it's hard for me to get that out of my head i want to call it glooky still you want to call it glooky like no lucky clucky gucky lucky and what we can call whatever we want i guess but i'd just like to know what it's really called it's like you scrape these down here we want those chunks of spinach to if you say if it's like if it's glooky can you say if the two o so we can tell it's like okay so cali wants to know if it's glooky or it's glucky or it's glucky like lucky lucky we really want to know somebody tell us somebody help us out okay so i'm going to sprinkle it in i think you just splashed me oh sorry well you'll smell minty you'll be very festive okay i'm gonna sprinkle it in how much did we need hon we need a quarter of a teaspoon for one recipe rounded and we're gonna do double so we're gonna need half a teaspoon around so we're gonna make some noise again and i'm going to sprinkle it in super slowly get it going anytime this hits the liquid it's going to start forming these little rubbery balls of clump it's not very appealing oh she thinks it's like lucky lucky that's what we were hoping lucky so were we saying it right for those two years what did we say before i can't even remember now i think we said we said lucky yeah we said right the whole time so baby we're saying it right well thanks for helping us out letting us know what we should be saying there brandi okay cali so let's add a couple more ice cubes do you want to grab the ice back out it's looking a little thin we want it nice and thick like a true shamrock shape it's gotta be thick perfect maybe add well originally it said we should add eight and you added six right six times two so go ahead add four more let's go the original amount we should have just followed the recipe and done the eight cubes like it said all right i said wrong not lucky oh not lucky oh oops so it isn't lucky it's glooky with two o's like that sound lukey no i'm just confused glooky we're gonna have to retrain our brains callie okay [Music] so now what it said to do is it said once you've got your glucky in there you're supposed to just like let it sit 30 seconds to a minute let that glue activate and then put it back on again and it's supposed to give it the best texture i don't know i'm not a very good rule follower i have a tendency to just throw it all in there why don't you get us some glasses and some straws so yeah i'm not really a rule follower when it comes to the shakes i know many of them say add the protein powder in the last 10 seconds and i'm not so good at following that we like a fluffy shape so we don't we just usually all throw it all in there all right can you reach out get rich our fridge is way too full considering it has nothing in it can you reach it do you need me to grab one yes i don't want a glass to fall on your head no that would have hurt you're going to use that one okay sure you can use that one i'll use this one these oh this looks good let's see look how nice and shamrock shape and it smells like i think we got it had a really minty maybe you could have cut it back we ended up doing half i did two capsules so probably closer to half a teaspoon and it probably definitely could have been more like one one and a half capfuls but we like minty so a shamrock shake should be minty right callie we said we were gonna make for the boys we should better save some hey uh-huh we better just you're having less sure i guess i'm having less it's all right i'll have more if there's enough for everybody to go around let's give it a try um it's really good oh it's really minty i really like it but i honestly i would like to add okra to this i think the texture would be even more milkshake like if you added okra so i think the next time we're going to add two cups of okra one cup per recipe um yeah um you know those um things that you can find at sweet and sprouted which things are we talking about those make your own ice cream package yes you could make some of those and then put it in you totally substitute some of the ice you totally could so kelly thinks next time we make the shamrock shake we should make some homemade sugar-free vanilla ice cream and plop it in there and that's a great idea it would taste even more like a true shamrock shake okay we're gonna hop to our next recipe another really quick one and this one is our strawberry lemon we're calling them lemon limeade because we're out of lemon juice and we do have the strawberry lemonade packets so we're going to use one of these you have the same brown as this for the yeah we normally buy the same brand so we're going to do the strawberry lemon limeade starburst superfood chews um so if you follow in the trim healthy book the superfood chews i believe are in the original trim healthy cookbook but there's not this recipe this recipe was just found on the page on the trim healthy main page so i will still link it in the comments so you can see it there so it's just somebody tweaked the original recipe which is normally a chocolate one and there's a few other variations and we're gonna do a strawberry lemonade hardly any of this stuff that's okay we won't quite have enough of the strawberry protein powder but we will add a little plain two and a half scoops scoops oh this scoop is what you just dropped off of there let me move this out of the way and then we can bring the food processor in and then you can get started on it i can tell you guys kelly is chomping at the she loves starburst if you have any like really good cheap fruit processors food processors yeah we talked about that last time our food processor is very sad when we do one of these videos with it one day it's just going to give us the ghost because it's very old that's okay hopefully it won't be today hopefully it's gonna it smells like strawberries it's a strawberry yeah don't dump it we don't have a lot especially strawberry starburst well that's the goal here we're trying to make something that tastes like strawberry starburst do you want me to just dump it in if you hold the scoop over we'll do it as teamwork okay okay so you're gonna need for these starburst fruit chews oh we've got glooky again oogie i think it says goofy yeah we have to start saying it right callie we're gonna embarrass ourselves saying lucky a hundred times i think i just like that it sounds like a lucky i don't know okay so we need to think that should you maybe we should just call it oh we could call it lucky good point cali okay so we need two and a half scoops of the strawberry trim healthy mama we're using their strawberry protein powder you could probably use a different strawberry one if you've got it use what you've got we're just using what we've got which is apparently not enough one and a half so don't dump that yet because we're gonna top it up we're gonna need two and a half all together so we're gonna need some plain we've just got the plain this is just the trim healthy mama plain protein powder we are in desperate need of going for a shopping trip kelly because that's all i've got left for protein powder in the house and that's like a tragedy okay so we're gonna need two and a half this stuff's fluffier i wonder if they're gonna turn out different with the plane in there oh well we're gonna find out so that's two and then we need another half well maybe the other one's not so fluffy because they don't have it the other one is less fluffy because of flavor i'm not sure why the flavored trim healthy protein powders are less fluffy than that do we need glucose we need no we don't no we need uh collagen you want to grab the collagen one more time and we did have this from our previous recipe that we used it for collagen let me get these other dishes out of the way callie one half see it isn't see me does it mean cup cup yes a c in a recipe would mean cup oh oh half a cup honey so not the table food what's that oh yes not the tablespoon i'm totally wrong you are right i think callie's reading the recipe we have a cup of collagen there's a lot of collagen hence what makes them super food chews there's the half cup cali get some of that in there this is almost like the strawberry really dip it in here turn this like that sideways i'll hang on to it for you this is almost like the strawberry what protein powder because it's like oh the texture the collagen yeah it's the same half cup yep we want to be kind of more exact on this recipe because we want them to turn out where they stick together okay perfect and then we need to see the star ingredients which is going to be floss tea lucy lucy lucy they say glooky they say everybody says something different apparently yeah that's all right i'm gonna call it lucky that is so so so minty next we're going to try it with the dried mint like the recipe calls for see if it makes a difference because i really like that that's the difference between her recipe so okay we're gonna use in this case the recipe calls are you okay you bump your almonds it called for these the true lemon lemonade don't be mistaken and just buy the true lemon that are just the crystallized lemon you need these to be the lemonade mix and there's all different flavors so you could change this recipe i got two more in my hand i need a cup so you can use whatever flavor you want and change the flavor of your starburst fruit shoes to be whatever flavor you buy there you are dear cali is on a mission tonight we are on mission make this video short nice and short we're gonna try and be quick tonight one it smells like strawberry night kelly's gotta head to the bath after this it's like a purple color it is um that smells good this is a real life school weeknight kind of video we gotta be fast right kelly gotta go chop chop so i'm excited if these are good we're gonna buy more of the true lemon packets and do different flavors and we're gonna make a whole like mixture so when we've got those cravings for something chewy and candy-like we can be chomping on these her it's really perfect no there's a good chance cali we'll test it before we completely decide we like the flavor but we used some plain protein powder so there is a chance this might not be just a second okay there's a chance this might not quite be sweet enough because we didn't use all strawberry protein powder we did have to sub some plain in there so we're gonna taste it when it's done and if we need to we'll either add some super sweet or we will add another packet of the lemonade so we're going to have to just be careful of that don't let me forget to try it isn't lemonade like sour yes but there's also sweetener in this this is already pre-sweetened this one it's got um well there's actually cane sugar in here but it's just such a minimal amount and there's stevia leaf extract in there okay callie so it said you're supposed to combine all of this first blitz it up a little bit just so it's all combined evenly so that you're not getting like some that just tastes like collagen pulse it um you just whizz it on low maybe give it a quick whiz go ahead smells like it's burning i don't smell burning i smell lemonade no like when it was whirling then it smelled like oh dear that's just because our food processor is dying okay so to this cali we have to add some lemon juice and then we're gonna process it a little more and then add our coconut oil oh yes the lime juice we're gonna do lime juice because we're out of lemon so two table two tablespoons you can use that tablespoon measure over there extra collagen no all right collagen for what because i have like a little less oh that'd be fine that little tiny bit in the spoon will be fine i'm gonna let callie do the cooking video and i'm just gonna drink the shade give it a good shake those things when they're kind of new you have to yep you're getting it keep going [Music] keep going you're able to see this one you want it to be a bit more precise so that they stick together good keep going keep going a little bit more perfect one okay go ahead with one more we need two tablespoons it's bubbly in there add the lime juice or you could use lemon juice and two tablespoons of coconut oil i'll get the coconut oil started cali okay i'll get it ready to go but i'll wait actually because i don't want to interrupt you and i need to have a measuring spoon excellent i'm just gonna grab a spoon for the coconut why is it bubbly in there in here it's probably reacting with the um the packet of the lemonade that'd be my guess okay i'm going to grab something like that and vinegar yeah sort of like that okay so you need to begin processing and it says says when you put the juice in you need to start processing it like online like on low what no lime juice it smells like really like lemonade oh it smells really good and it's a little crummy it's supposed to be crumbly at this point it's supposed to be crumbly that looks right i'm using kind of a one and a half tablespoon measure and then a half tablespoon because again that's all we have for measuring spoons around here is random random ones so we're gonna use this one is a half so that'll give us two tablespoons of coconut oil i don't think you want to use a coconut oil that has much flavor here we're using this one this one's our favorite you see it there um it's ideal for cooking the omega nutrition one it has no coconut taste whatsoever i just got a sugar so it's my favorite to use i like coconut but i don't want coconut starburst that's it oops it actually sounds sort of good coconut starburst well that'll be your next creation maybe kelly okay so that you want to whizz it up again and we'll check if it holds together okay now be careful for the blade we gotta check if it's gonna just be careful there's a blade in there we're just going to see if it holds together i think it's going to hold together it's very coconut oily but it seems to be holding together holding a nice little ball there it's like a little gumball yeah we want it to hold together taste it see if it needs anything that tastes really good it tastes like a strawberry starburst mm-hmm which is exactly like a strawberry lemonade starburst i don't think we need to add any more sweetener there is no such thing as strawberry lemon there's no strawberry lemonade starburst but that would taste like a strawberry one you know all the flavors i don't but i'll take your word for it okay so now you have a couple of options a person can either take just take your fingers like we just did and make little balls out of this or you can roll it into a log and slice it i think we should roll it in a log and slice it what do you think callie can i slice it sure you roll on too long okay i'm going to grab a cutting board to do this one because this looks like it might be pretty greasy from the coconut oil and we'll do it on a cutting board and then if you want to grab a knife there should be one check if there's one in that drip tray over there for doing the supper dishes okay so we're just gonna form this into a log it seems to be sticking together nice okay then you can grab one from this drawer but just let me roll this out first okay because you have to get in there a little bit of sausage it's very coconut oily like i feel like it kind of had a little less coconut oil it sounds very coconut oily anybody made this does it look right i think it's supposed to be like shiny i think it's just melting from my warm hands yeah but it's very very coconut oily you're not gonna wait hey no no you're eager i'll just use this you're gonna use that big chef's knife okay nobody can see you want to come on the other side of me yeah but i gotta roll this up a little bit this knife in the house be careful with it please kind of holding it dangerously there for a minute all right now we may have a problem because this is not really wanting to roll out nice and thin we may have to do some forming of it with our hands i think that's what we're going to do it looks honestly like all the coconut oil is coming out of this and that can't be right so we're going to try and improvise well if your hands are melting well we don't want to lose all the coconut oil in our recipe yeah right so if you want to cut in pieces they have to be kind of even pieces calisora they're somewhat the same size and then what maybe i'll do since this looks a little on the big side i'm just going to break that into two maybe we'll go ahead and just form these with our hands starburst yeah absolutely you cut them in or even you just cut some and then you can help me form them i think we should do them in little squares like starburst would look like little cute squares can you see that our lighting in our house in the evening is absolutely terrible so i apologize because it looks like we're in a cave right now yeah we have a light on the way so that the lighting will be a bit better because it still gets dark here really early it's only 7 30 and it's getting dark outside so we're gonna get something but can you see our little starburst fruit shoes aren't those the cutest we're gonna have very greasy fingers when this is done cali did you cut them into half again yeah they're gonna be pretty big i think kind of just make them form them into little cubes flat they're gonna be bigger than a starburst i feel like we could have even made these into half again oh my god well you make that one whatever size you want it but i think the rest will make them just like little tiny one bite poppers because these are super filling with all that collagen in there and that protein powder you know this is a one right one that looks like a huge bite one you'd be full after just having one really you don't want to slice it in half and make it smaller i can make it smaller that would fill me up with just one it would so i think it's fun to do these in different flavors i like i do like the chocolate ones they remind me of a tootsie roll so i do like those ones too although i do not remember them being so drippy with coconut oil so i don't know if that is something to do with the lemonade packets just not being quite the same as the original recipe there's less dry ingredients but i mean they're turning out they're just drippy with coconut oil do this over guys this is pretty small and try to make sure sure you do it whatever you however you like that looks great this one has to cut in half after i made it you're gonna make it a starfish mini sausage a mini sausage so i think these would be fun to do with the kids if your kids like to eat thm food my kids do you can like probably make these any shape you want these would be really fun to do as something the kids could get involved in doing it's like school safe they would be school safe we have a tough time finding school safe snacks that in our house is really important as well because we have a son with a peanut and a sesame allergy so it's really hard to find snacks that are safe for him that are both peanut free and sesame free sesame is the even harder one i think than peanuts these days is finding things that are sesame free so whenever we find something fun like this this would be a super cute little lunch box accompaniment are you trying it yeah you taste testing it no see if it's any good i think they'll be even better once they're cold we'll chill them and then all that coconut oil will firm up and then they will be super good because that's what i used to do with the traditional recipe they used to wrap them individually and then put them into the fridge so like you'd wrap them and then you put them in the fridge so yeah i don't want to chill these because i well we're not going to eat them all this is making a lot so we're going to keep forming these and enjoying them yeah right i'm not sure if we have too much else to show you guys tonight we want to keep this really short and sweet we just wanted to show you a fun shake for st patty's day so um if you're just starting to join us now go and watch the replay we'll post the recipes in the comments and enjoy yourself a shamrock shake for st patrick's day and

all they get you high so you've been thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time thank you very much for watching and follow us like us subscribe to us for more news cannabis thank you", "b4Z9ges7yuE": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shop and we're on a what I would call a trick-or-treat candy because it's the fun size starburst

blueberry here we go blueberries everyone my favorite flavor looking between these two cherry not Lauren's mysteries mango sorry soft and chewy I've done plenty of videos of different kinds of starbursts and I've cut them and shape them in twisted them mmm nice orange flavor the last one is the baddie blackberry here we go it's hard to eat four of these in a row mm-hmm I like that one very

gas station and I'm cutting through the candy aisle with the gum and lo and behold something catches my eye airhead gum and it says new on the package so we got a airhead gum this is blue raspberry don't you see it focus blue raspberry and cherry flavored do I are you going to open up handy-dandy kind of like all gum now comes in this mint gum used to come in the sticks used to pull it out and get mad and get stuck anyways let's try this cherry flavored I am a sucker for airheads no lying I love airheads so it's also note on the package that says airhead cherry airheads gum with micro candies don't know if you can really see this but there are little pieces of candy and that's come cool immediately tastes like cherry airhead chili like gum I got a feeling that probably going to lose the flavor really really quick you can taste the little piece of the candy in it which is kind of neat but the flavors going away and I just swallowed it do you guys swallow gum I have some type of problem when it comes to gum I'm gonna try the blue raspberry much sucker for blue raspberry especially in the airheads I love so blue raspberry airhead gum this one also has little pieces of candy man it's really neat how they how companies can mix up tastes so good again the flavor is right there it slowly goes away just like most gum tell me a piece of gum that has flavor for more than like five minutes really hard to find I give these I get them four out of five I think they're really neat it's a different type of gum the candies really cool in there because it uh it explodes which is really cool have you guys ever seen these yet they comes downstairs in the basement what's your favorite airheads flavor let me know downstairs like always hit the like button share this video out and check out all over other videos at the end of this one so this is Adam this is Ben solo review [Music]", "8Zu6AGgUtFY": "hey guys Tammy and Ashley are going to be trying a blind taste test between these Kellogg's fruity snacks mix berry and the Welch's fruit snack and we're all gonna do the berries and cherries because the fruit punch is too far different from the fruit from the mixed berry the Kellogg's were 398 at Walmart and they're 70 calories per pouch and there are 20 pouches in the box and the Welch's there were also 398 at Walmart they're 80 calories per pouch and there are 22 pouches and all similar to 1111 but I don't know that so yeah so I'm gonna get these open now I've got these two plates set up for Kellogg's and Welch's I'm going to open up probably a couple packs just to get the flavors all the flavors and then I'll be back to let you know what the case law okay here they are the Kellogg's brand the three and here's the Welch's there's actually six there's six different ones and we'll just compare the ones that I think are equal to each other so we'll be back to watch you blind taste test these people okay here are the victims I mean the people that's gonna try these the first thing we're going to try is this and we're going to try these hands good flavor very very chewy like squishy chewy our firm chewy I don't like that flavor okay no try this like that one better - I like this will better better flavor much better flavor mmm-hmm next time we'll get this one right there good big flavor mm-hmm good texture yeah flavor I agree guess not a good texture any like has little particles in it I don't like it it's not that one didn't have a bad flavor but the texture is weird yeah wasn't growing I'm gonna believe this one I can't swear that that's the same but little city no that didn't have I didn't care about it's okay you know this one Lanza I think the flavor is matched but I can't swear to that okay you can pick the level they did not like these at all the Kellogg's brand I didn't like the texture you that's the one you said tasted chunky and stuff like that yeah the Welch's you picked pick them all the same yeah sure you just try that those now different than what we had yes it looks like blackberries and a good texture good is it raspberry I know blackberry that's what kind of look like I don't know I don't think it has much of a flavor at all to be honest this is kind of dude these aren't really powerful flavors ruined in this mixture so that's actually the berries and cherries which is what she likes yeah yeah you said this was like your favorite mixture and I I don't I would not personally buy this mess I would rather have a very distinct grape apple orange you should boil them I'm in the mood for well since I even all together no matter the Welch's ones they have a gummy bear texture almost uh yeah they didn't get me very definitely I would know by either one of those definitely not the Kellogg's I know I know what about viewers she said she really likes Kellogg's and I'm sorry but when you're comparing it to something else side by side you can real it's a noticeable difference it really is a very very noticeable lick that gesture like when you chewed it it broke down into little particles in your mouth and that just disturbs me so like a little squares of freaky techno so Welch's well just one yeah well just one I personally wouldn't buy the mix like I said I actually liked it so but it was a fun review and I'm glad actually recommended we tried and thanks for watching I want to make sure I said because we really didn't care for this berries and cherries Kevin and I have done reviews on other Kellogg's gummies and we loved on in the regular mix where you get like the fun shapes and stuff like that they have like an cherry and orange and lemon and love their blueberry a raspberry I think it's raspberry anyway those are really really good I just didn't care for this particular variety", "bY6KhONqTKA": "hey Olivia integratron two sweet items I have a Wrigley's juicy fruit American pop America pop flavored gum which we'll call a ball pops a box with a brand America pop this will be

I don't think it tastes like those mushrooms maybe it does way better than that hello thing send up more about blueberry them we're so kind of bearing the police knowledge along no no it's a bear done that that we are just a very flower good berry fun I guess I mean it's really hard I thought identify basically ASAPS a bunch of people and see what and what they said it was well it says because that means we this is the mix of cherry and blue raspberry two flavors that really hadn't ever made yeah they shouldn't mix up see what it might be good in an ice cream when you're eating them pieces um on the fall like a clips together I can't put a label on at all right I can't even I couldn't even attempt to try to explain that I would need it again no I'm done with it however I live I wouldn't continue to choose this also if you like berry flavor give it a try you might really like it but I would yeah under that has a very juicy fruit so you know let me go to the video thanks [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "MZCLpbTnHWk": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Drusilla candy Corner and ran across these in my grocery store I put these up on there my community a little while back and I just never got to him yet but I thought I would give these a try tonight and I remember these from when I was little and when I was little I kind of liked baseball was kind of into it my one neighbor he was a really big sports fan his whole family was and used to go over there and they would babysit me after school and so they were always into the baseball and sports and soccer and football and you know you name it and they watched it and seemed to me that when we were little these were in the grocery stores and I think could even get him from like that ice-cream man and I don't know if they had all these flavors I think they only had like one or two flavors back in the old times house little so and these are the actual company is well what is the company okay it is big league chew huh sorry I didn't know big li big league chew bubblegum and here we go I got two flavors they had other flavors they had like the original one was the bubble gum then they had original flavor I guess it's like you know regular gum and then they had these two and they had another one I didn't want to get one this one is called ground ground ball grape and sour [Music] couple swinging sour apple okay I don't know if these two are around when I was little it's mostly the bubble gum and I think they might have had great and there was another one it was blueberry but I didn't want blueberry and then they had one it was called original which is like regional gum and seems to me that you know this is it's an official hall-of-fame bubble gum so it is like by the big league that players would have this and I remember seeing stuff about the big league players will always have this and they had to chew but they'd also have their you know tobacco that they would shoot guess what would get kind of nasty in the dugout but also they had one time I saw this guy he did a thing and he called it a backhoe ball and when he does he took his big league chew and he wrapped it around the tobacco and he chewed that all in his mouth and it was like I don't know I was a little bit weird but yeah so now this is weird because 10 calories per serving and each serving sizes 8 pieces and these are like shredded bubble gums and it says there's 20 servings per container so no it's the same with this one 10 calories for 8 little strips of bubble gum and I guess that's not like quibbling of maybe one or two sticks of actual bubble gum like or if the hubbub of what you're getting chunks or those other ones that we get but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and I think I'll go with the break because I was always like my favorites grape flavor oh yeah it's all pressed together wow wow you can smell that grape flavor to it and you got to see you got this stuff and it's got all this looks like corn starch around it to keep it from sticking together I don't remember the corn starch but maybe that's new and yeah this is like this is probably like eight strips it looks pretty bad but it is actually pretty soft oh my oh come on certainly remember that one okay well more hello no you got enough of this it was pretty good bubblegum so this is pretty good grape flavor but after a little while it does kind of lose the sugar at the loser flavor but my my one friend would say is dead after you chew it for a while you had to throw it out to the guy cocky that's what I remember from my one friend and yeah we went we went to some baseball games together or seem to be gone a lot of place while I went to Hawaii with him one time and um yeah he was like ultimate sports fan cuz he was always on the radio listening to it or watching it on TV or watching on TV and he had the radio on to hear the play-by-play because it was better on the radio if it was some kind of game you know soccer football baseball I don't think he watched tennis too much but hockey anything they were like and they were the whole family over there was a big 49ers fan and that was like their team that Giants and the 49ers were like their favorite ones and I went to I went to a couple of Giants game with them and I don't remember if we had big league chew there or not but certainly I think this was something we would have as kids you get it like from the ice-cream man or you get it dumb no grocery store mini-market mmm sometimes I'd go me and him would go down like to 7-eleven or something and we get some things on no here's the swing and sour apple it's kind of mmm how long the same lines uh-huh but see how this tastes I don't remember this one might be fairly new hmm oh wow wow that was good very sour actually mixed it's pretty good with the grape mmm pepper to it mm-hmm [Music] I remember one game when I went to with my friend um we went with um we went to I think it was an AIDS game it might have been Candlestick Park West Candlestick Park before they tore it down I'm in love with one friend and hmm fever if you had ever been there before know anything about it the weather over there is like really kind of finicky and we went to the game and one friend that was driving he had had a short sleeve shirt and shorts this was probably like mid October or September I don't know or April or whatever I'm the bay in San Francisco we went over there we told him dude you got to bring like pants or sweats and he got to bring a jacket cause it's on the bay he's like now he fine you know and we got a ticket we were sitting like out the bleachers like I would middle of the field there's a breeze there and it was all open he froze his butt off because the wind and you're not even though it's sunny it's still nice and really windy over there and he was trying to get um hot dog wrapper Herzing hmm paper and programs and stuff he's type of cover up with those um he wanted to go get a sweatshirt but the sweatshirts were like 45 bucks he's like I'm not paying that and then so you pretty much froze up there I had brought him I want regular pants but I had brought like a little windbreaker I'm still a little cold up there we had a pretty good time but I listened to him complaining the whole time I have teams like back in the old days these have the good stuff that the baseball parks they don't have them anymore the malted milks in a little container with the Platte the wooden wooden spoon some of those things regular hot dogs you know Cracker Jacks peanuts they come to the stand and they bring them tea and stand and soda we weren't old enough for beer so but now it's like all I'm kind of exploded all the different things they have but I remember that and I remember we probably didn't have this big league too you know had a bag somewhere him used to blow bubbles and all that so what's kind of fun I said I found these in the store they were like a dollar the dollar piece they're on a display so if you want to find find a bag of big league chew and relive some of your childhood memories of when you were little and you thought you were you know picture or run King go ahead and give me a try these are really fun and you have to sort of get them softened up before you could blow a bubble and I'll attempt to do that I'm not real good at it my practice I haven't done it for quite few years so hmm but any time anyways if you liked the video go ahead and give it a thumbs up and don't forget to hit the subscribe

you this time of Haribo raspberries Oh Haribo Haribo Haribo they have such a varied and strange expensive really one could say line of candies and gummies and the raspberries yeah this is one I've seen all over the place this is actually you know they do a lot of like um I know limited run stuff as well that you see and then it's gone and they have so many sick use that it's it's hard to keep track of them all but raspberries is actually one that I've seen around quite a lot it's not one of their core their core brands I mean I think that really looks like Super Max star mix hang fast Ickx I don't know those are probably though that and then obviously the gold bears which is Haribo sort of staple gummy are there sort of marquee products but raspberries is one that you see kind of up all over the place as well and I think that's because it's so unique it's really different than a lot of the other Haribo products um basically you've got black and red raspberries as you can see here they are candy raspberries this on the back here it says it's the same here to say anything about them gummy candy try these other other hairbow flavors oh gold bears happy Cola sure that's another another one over there big ones sour sketti sure peaches and many more there are many more because it doesn't say anything well basically what this is though is caribou Haribo mainly makes gummies and this is a gummy on the inside raspberry flavored gummies and I don't think there's any difference between a black and a red put on the outside on the outside of the interesting thing they've got non Perales is what they're called it's like um it's a it's a confection sugar and cornstarch basically but do you know what it is it's like if you go to get a donut and it's the kind or like maybe a cupcake or something and they have the teeny little usual rainbow little balls on the outside that are like a little bit crunchy that candy that's what this is it's just those tiny little balls and obviously instead of being multicolored it's just all red here and all black here isn't that neat I never would have thought that I don't think I've ever actually had this I did not open it the right way oh well that's okay looks great so exciting oh my god it smells so good there they are guys doesn't those donut look good no that raspberry candy that is not a common thing right oh boy so once you get it out you can clearly see it's very it's not doesn't get that far into the raspberry I mean it sure look they look pretty good but it's not quite all the way like the top is just a flat piece but they're generally the right shape and I'm excited let's give this a try huh we're gonna eat the whole thing mmm wow it really is those crunchy little little balls from the top of a donut on the outside well that's really good man it's sweet and the raspberry flavor is really strong and I mean not it's not um what is it tarp you know raspberries can have a little tartness to them this is just pure sweet let me see if I can just so check this out it's if I'm gonna focus here so the inside is just straight gummy I'm not super chewy gummy I mean it's a little chewy but it's like it's you know closer to the swedish fish chomp through it kind of gummy then the gold bears you know chomp around for a million hours tell me their style gum so really good like I said great flavoring mm-hmm so I guess the only other question really would be due to black raspberries tastes like blackberries do they taste like black raspberries what did they just kind of taste the same I'm not gonna be disappointed either way honestly now raspberries fantastic let's try the black I think it's probably the same taste hmm yeah yeah as far as I can tell that's the same taste is it which one eat so many of these they're actually a good size too it's like big enough that it really is like it's like a large gumdrop size or something right like it's not like you're gonna be eating more than one of these at a time hmm just tasting them in quick succession to see if I can tell the difference I don't think there's a difference I think they're all the same but I gotta say this is great only remember what is cost but seems like a good investment it's an investment people this candy is an investment in your future in your tasting enjoyment future I recommend it Haribo raspberries really good why can't candy I was gonna break them it's not quite it's almost a 5 out of 5 it's a 4 very strong like 4.9 out of 5 that's why I eat these all day yeah they're great ok guys sorry I don't really have anything else to say they're really good good flavor um if you like raspberries check them out who doesn't like raspberries totally worth it yeah so that's what I think you guys let me know what you think in

back [Music] big [Music] all right so y'all i pretty much went overboard right yes i did because there's some more stuff in there but i'm not gonna take that out um y'all when i tell you this isn't you guys saw it this isn't even half of that place do y'all remember doing this y'all kids making my nerves baby hand me my lighter all right so y'all i'm gonna show y'all the stuff that we picked up there's no way in the world i can show y'all everything well there is a way in the world but um i'm gonna show y'all what we picked up and tell me if you guys remember these things um we just went nuts in there all right so y'all remember these things it's called they call it peanut butter bar these things it tastes like peanut butter like a little i don't know what that flavor is on the outside but in the inside it tastes like peanut butter my grandmother used to have these all the time i know everybody remember these candies from their grandmothers if you were really good if you got some of these some of these peppermint patties those hard candies she always had those hard candies these mirror jeans right here i wish i know about that this candy you just not be this big they have gum on the inside of it they have those these right here how much did y'all used to pay for those y'all tell me how much y'all used to pay for those in the comments and i'm gonna tell you how much we used to pay for these we paid two cents for these two cents each for these i got this one because we used to have these things but they were uh bubble gum they it wasn't a gummy the hamburger ones we had to get the crybaby we ended up picking up but this right here this is my uncle's favorite one of my one of my uh my uncle junior that was his favorite one of his favorites got the lemonheads remember the lemonade she's come smaller than this in a little pot package and got some of these things right here and i used to fight my sister for the red ones all the time or the cream strawberry ones i don't i think this is a cream stroke yep yep used to fight her all the time for the strawberry cream one we used to get into it all the time because of that and then these they used to come in um like little smaller ones you know that's something that's why people so big nowadays everything is big but these used to come smaller than this and you pop the whole thing in your mouth and you drink out the juices inside of it my other sister reminded me of the hubba bubble kind they used to have the dr pepper on them in the middle he used to have a dr pepper syrup and stuff like that coca-cola syrup in the middle they probably have those i have no idea um i just know that i just saw stuff and just start putting it in the bag oh do y'all remember these bit of honey these right here i think i showed everything but um these right here these cigarettes maybe you couldn't tell you could tell us we weren't grown and we'll take the gum of course we had to take that gum and eat it they had the little gum on the inside of it these teddy's gonna die there was some more candy these are the ones these i felt like these were the knockouts of these these were the good kind these were the little knockouts because it's like peppermint candy or something like that a long time ago they marketed this stuff to children look at this tobacco we are obsessed with smoking something it's it's funny but it's not funny we are obsessed with smoking something kids walking around with cigarettes trying to be like their parents um getting stuff talking about getting stuff talking about they taking their blood pressure medicines okay all kinds of stuff acting like they popping pills and chewing on tobacco like what was what was what were we doing what were we doing what were we going through to where we wanted to sit up here and act like this and why did they make candy like that like and they wonder why we the way we are now look at this look how it looks if you if you've never seen it before look how this stuff looks just did they wrong y'all see that you pick it out like this you pick it out just like you pick out and then they have it like in strings you pick it out just like you pick out the stuff you put in the bottom here and we used to do it able to take this stuff put it on the bottom i think but let's let's not even talk about let's not talk about getting a white cup putting this in your mouth i'm so shiny put this in your mouth and spit but this is all the candy i don't know what we're gonna do with all this candy i don't know what we're gonna do with this but this is all the candy got the cookies and cream we have the kiss shirley temple ginger ale strawberry shortcake pickle soda apple pie soda hot ginger ale but it's doomsday lemonade osama bin

raspberry Senate now that you know how to eat a raspberries enjoy some in season for more new recipes click subscribe thanks for watching", "neOErb5QOck": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the sour patch kids a lollipop with sour candy dipping powder there are 25 individually wrapped packs in here it says each pack includes lollipop and dip these were 3.99 at target and honestly i saw them there and i would not have thought a thing about them but ashley our daughter is absolutely crazy about anything sauerkraut and she is very very familiar um these are all raspberries she is very very familiar with uh the what they offer from sour patch and she said i've never seen anything like that before and so she bought and some for her uh i think to give away to her kids at school and uh or to eat maybe to eat because when you go into her house her uh her place she has a ball like welcomes you when you go in the door and in that bowl is all kinds of different sour patch things bags and and she just loves stuff like that and so when i told her i said well i'm gonna buy she bought a bag i said i'm gonna buy a bag and uh because she really wanted two bags uh to have enough for all the kids and i said i'll buy a bag and we'll review them and i said then i'll give you the rest of the bag so that's what we're doing um this has pink raspberry and it has red berry there are it says one pack 25 servings per container one pack 15 grams is 60 calories so 60 calories for each of these if you eat the whole thing um includes lollipop and dip so this is like um a different dipping stick is that what it's called or which and you could you have a place on the back to put two in from um i've got the red there you go okay so so you get the the pop and it's shaped like one of those children around the front with the hair it's already got powder all over it [Music] i like the red berry flavor i don't really get sour from them made in mexico okay okay now all the powder in the bottom is white so and you get a little tartness from it but it's not a lot it looks like it's got hair oh i can dip his whole head and make maggie mustard hazel yeah that has white hair that is actually really really good no it's not bad i get a little bit of sourness to it but but not much it um frosted the frosted tips um a little bit of sourness but um it has a really nice flavor for me personally i would much rather just buy this in a candy form than buy it on the stick yeah i'd rather have like a gummy or oh it has his face on there too oh see i was looking i was looking well i thought it was just the shape of his head i was looking at the back of his head the whole time and i turned him around he actually has eyes and a snake it looks like a tiki uh a tiki face yeah liking gilligan's alan yeah um okay these are pink raspberry i like the flavor of that one's a little stronger oh that's really good i like that one better i mean it looks good this one seems to be stronger it's really nice raspberry um oftentimes when we try candies i'll compare i'll say these remind me of something else whether these remind me of a lifesaver starburst jolly rancher these don't remind me of any of those these are in a category the flavor the flavor is in a category all on its own these are very distinct sour patch kid flavors that don't remind me of other candies do they you no but i'd still would rather have just the gummies the gummy candies oh i would too the sucker is just more to deal with you got to have the stick you could take somebody and you when you grab a gummy and just stick your mouth and start chewing well or um if if sour patch kid made these in like little hard candies i would totally well i mean they they would that that would be something really cool um for me i'm not going to eat it and we've said this about other things about dum dum suckers that we've got i wish they sold these in hard candy because they sell some really good good flavors um but a stick is is not something that i'm going to walk around i mean these are great for kids i think kids will love them adults will love them too if you don't mind eating suckers i would just rather not have a sucker right i would think ashley will eat a couple of these but i'd say she'll be sure because ashley's not i don't i can't imagine actually sitting around on the couch eating these i just can't but you don't know so uh but they're out there they were new to her and so i don't know if it's a new thing or not uh but i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "0YbwiZOkCc4": "[Music] it's caffeine time baby yeah you're watching mel's and chris and today we got some caffeine got some energy drinks baby got them energy drinks we have a lot of caffeine here yes first guys say thank you to cj at ghost energy for sending us a case of energy drinks he wants us geeked out yeah he wants us all wired today but we're going to try the four flavors they have which is sour patch red berry red berry sorry you have the sour patch blue raspberry which this is their newest flavor yeah that's their new one yeah and then the originals is tropical mango and you have the citrus citrus and what's crazy is i was actually looking for the sour patch ghosts local walmart but i never found it so i guess cj was reading it right he's like hey i hear somebody calling for ghosts i know right um but these are what i've from what i've read about them they are they're big in the pre-workout yeah they're big in the workout world because they are chocked full of vitamins and everything else and there's zero sugar yep it's zero sugar it's got five calories per can so i mean five calories and then 200 grams of caffeine got 200 milligrams of natural caffeine it's got a hundred milligram of neural factor and it's got your four daily vitamins it's got a 150 milligram of alpha g gpc and it's got a thousand milligram of carni pure karatine i don't know if i said that right i'm not even gonna try so it's got a thousand milligrams acetyl l-cardiotime 100 milligrams of nero factor there we go i can say that word neurofactor factor but yeah it's legendary energy it helps with epic focus zero sugars no artificial colors i think it's gonna help me because in the morning when i work out at four o'clock yeah we got them all right we do that four o'clock morning and i'm like yawning the whole time oh my gosh which one's that one smell crisp and i love their packaging it's like uh uh what is that like a 3d yeah it's like a a wrap it's not just it's really nice packaging smells good is it sour um no it is absolutely freaking delicious and yes i got synthesis but that is absolutely freaking delicious i was actually like worried that i wasn't gonna like that one the citrus try it tastes like lemonade it does it tastes like lemonade tastes like a limeade from um sonic tastes like limeade from sonic is exactly what it tastes like it's got really good flavor it's what i'm surprised it's actually really sweet yeah it is sweet which i wasn't expecting but it's really sweet i guess that's really sweet boy i'll tell you what you could mix with that bad boy that was good i'm actually surprised i thought it was going to be really sour but it's not that's good um that was gonna i was expecting that to be my least favorite we'll do one of the sour yes just sour patch red berry i know we've tried sour patch the drink last time it was like medicine yeah it tasted like coffee sorry crush y'all's sour pie tastes like cough medicine oh i don't smoke i'm sorry don't smell this don't smell it i like smelling it though just because i like knowing oh see now don't smell it but it tastes good does it taste good yeah it does it it don't it's not sour at all oh when you smell it okay it tastes like medicine like the cough syrup like the little children smells like medicine yeah it smells like it does it smells like it smells like a um have you ever seen the flintstone vitamins yup that's what it smells like it smells like a plate somebody do this when i try it don't smell it it don't smell good but it's not sour it tastes just like the sour patch i know but it's without the sauce it's the sweet side of sour patch the sweet it's kind of like a sweet and sour uh red berry like the actual sour patch it's still kind of sour to me not like so bad sour i get that little bit just a tad bit like it's like an aftertaste it's good it's got a really good flavor because it's sweet it is there and i think they used sucralose so i can't even say that word yeah it's a topic it's not even got biotin in it which is like yeah it's got your vitamins it's got uh biotin it's got uh diamine vitamin c so it's got the about the b6 and b12 so it's an energy drink but it's full of like vitamins and stuff like that's probably what that smell comes from it's good for like when you're working out like gives you more endurance oh my goodness just don't smell that one it is kind of um it has a strong smell i'm telling you if you anybody that's got kids smell a flintstone vitamin and that's what it smells like yeah tastes good smells like a little bit more this one i'm actually looking forward to this is the tropical mango just because it looks it tastes really good no i like that one i think i like the lemon better and it's cool because it doesn't have uh no artificial flavors so i'm telling you this tastes like sonic like sonic's freaking llama it does that's what it tastes like that one is mango i love mango so hopefully it doesn't disappoint yeah this is your domain i'm a big fan of mangoes specific islander over here she's gonna be your critic on this one i don't know if i'm i don't know like i said i just like how it has five calories i'm a big fan of that i swear to goodness they're all good yeah so far i don't know about smells really good something that mixed with vodka or something you know what i mean something like that they sell it at gnc but it goes good like a lot of this you can find that gnc the vitamin shop uh certain places i'll mention up towards the end yeah um texas folks i got a heb yeah told you yes i hope they stay good for a while because i can't fit it i'm gonna have to drink one of these out but it don't get too flat yeah it's good i still like this one it does it reminds me of a limeade straight up all day long this one's gonna it's my new favorite right now it's got a very strong tropical mango flavor it's just like chocolate but i do taste mango yeah you can yeah tropical what's the flavor it's tropical i know right what's right a little pineappley yeah a little coconut at all it's just it's a good flavor making fun of what tropical would be it'll be a good flavor to mix with like a drink it really is all of them are but this one would be mine and this one is the newest version this is the ghost sour patch blue raspberry raspberry i know i know uh sour patch came out with like a bag just all blue raspberries haven't seen them well crush their uh their drink for crush is blue raspberry but it does it's gross yeah it tasted gross like my kids liked it but this one don't stink why does the red one smell i don't know it smells like flintstone it does well it's not like horrible just smells like a play somebody it reminds me of kids i mean it is sour patch oh lord this one's even better so i know you can find us nationwide at gnc vitamin shop and cutie like gas stations and i know they can come in like individual four packs or you can order like on their website like a 12 pack for 29.99 yeah the cases are 29 yeah but so it's like kind of individual price i'd say 250 each which isn't bad for an energy drink that does taste just like a blue server like that no this is has a strong like a blue bubble gum yeah like i'm not blue like a raspberry spinach to me it tastes like a blue bubble gum like a blue raspberry bubble gum well i well you know what i mean like my kids give me like bubbles i don't even know what type of those bites oh my gosh okay okay i'm good it's good i'm i'm i'm really quite honest i was not looking forward to doing this at all because everything we've tried sour patch was not good and then when you like citrus there's not heroes just thinking it to be sour but and that's like they said no sugar but they're all super sweet you know what it smells good but it's i still taste a little bit of cough syrup i don't know if that's just the blue raspberry flavor it reminds me it reminds me of the sour patch uh blue raspberry drink that we did not too long ago that's what that's what i taste i don't taste medicine at all in this one i do the aftertaste to me it's like when i take like one well because you got your mind on set on mangoes that's what it is she she'll have her mind pretty much like nope i don't like it i don't think i'm gonna like it that tropical mango is good yeah it is i really like it because it's sweet it doesn't have a bad aftertaste in order yeah for these this is my favorite because it tastes like sonic this is hers just because that's my first favorite and then the second one would be the citrus and then this one the blue one would be my third and that would be my last so because of the smell in this uh you can also find this at circle k in arizona nevada illinois missouri california uh heb here in texas and giant eagle in pennsylvania and i don't know if it's hyvee heavy i don't know but that's in the midwest area yeah but it's nationwide at gnc and you can always go on their website original flavors are the best yes the original this one i like this one just it's good it just it just smells as soon as you open the can it smells but these are the ghost energy drinks yep from ghost energy yeah from ghost energy like all videos like subscribe comment all that fun stuff", "oBBx2DA6lhs": "hello and welcome back to redneck snack and food reviews so i went to a couple dollar trees not too long ago just took a little trip to the dollar trees and i was like okay let's see what i can find let's see what kind of cool things i can pick up and so i didn't find the thing i was looking for i was looking for um sour patch kids chips ahoy but i just could not find them and so you know found quite a few things i'd never really noticed before and just bought them now a lot of stuff's not really new but i need some content to review and you know i can't just be like floating about going a couple days without doing a review i feel like it would be appropriate for me to find something even if it's random to just go ahead and do a review for so that's what i'm here doing right now is doing some random review but anyways that's aside from the point um what i wanted to review today was well before i get to what i want to review today go ahead and give this video a like a comment and a share go ahead and subscribe to my youtube channel and if you haven't already check out my instagram redneck snack and food anyways um my product that i'm reviewing today is super sour berry fruit gushers i don't know if you can see that very well and so it's got four flavors no three flavors look like four flavors but the first thing says fruit flavored snacks so um we've got raspberry lemonade i just reviewed some wafers that taste like that are that same flavor we've got blueberry grape oh that's a really weird combination and then to top it all off we've got mixed berry so that should be interesting i think that's the least weird so let's open these boys up and uh hopefully they're not oh oh when i opened this thing it hurt my nose that's how sour they are oh man i was kind of hoping they wouldn't be that sour now i don't know what is what because there's two ribs that's really annoying i should have made one purple one blue on red but they look the same this one's definitely different i ain't got no clue what is supposed to be what but i'm grabbing a whole bunch of the red ones hopefully i'm not grasping at straws here okay i can see the difference one's like a light red and yeah there's a dark grid let's be safe here and do those it's like playing marbles right now these small things now if i can only get these back in the package oh i'm ripping the whole thing open okay so let's go ahead and do blueberry grape first um because it's obvious what one that is here's the other two can't see much of a difference except for maybe a little bit but anyways let's let's get this review done with all right that's a very great dominant um flavor i don't taste too much of blueberry it really reminds me of um when you have a great flavored medicine with a sour punch to it too it's not bad but it really truly reminds me of grape medicine which is not my favorite thing but they know the grapes there i'm not sure they nailed the blueberry um i'm gonna do raspberry lemonade first darker one and just confirm yeah so raspberry lemonade let's taste that fruit maybe i could taste the henna lemonade but i could be mistaken that could be mixed berry right there but it was it was good um i just it didn't taste much like raspberry it didn't taste much like lemonade and it was sour at the end so these things don't really start out sour they are they build up to it we got the flavor and then the sour so it's basically sweet then sour you know what i mean not sour than sweet then gone there sweet wind sour than down anyways got one more flavor and then i'll uh rate this total thing i feel like i could taste more berry in that one more like a blueberry influence too so but the sour was had a good strong early hold um and that flavor so what do i want to rate this overall thing i think i'm going to give it an eight because it's a solid product it tastes good my problem here is that it doesn't really nail the flavors quite accurately like i was hoping but it's enjoyable and i i recommend it um if you find it somewhere i i don't know if the regular stores have them or not i just know i saw this in dollar tree and i had never really noticed it was like you know good change up super sour berry so uh yeah probably just a wasted review here but you know i ain't got nothing else for you um for today so i just wanted to get something up here for y'all to enjoy but anyways as always i will have more content um within the next week we yeah we're approaching the weekend so i'll try and have some stuff this weekend but don't expect too much um but that's why that's the beauty of like going and checking out my instagram because i post a lot of good content up there that i don't review so yeah that's all i got um and i hope you enjoyed this video not as angry as well i'm not angry at all now but you know it's not got the angry attitude that i had yesterday so i guess we're all good here so i'll see you all around and uh yeah have a good weekend yay", "QHxhZ1_U4ns": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review show I only say that because I think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on the get-go it's ah it gets worse just that awful awful awful aftertaste oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] these things are terrible but I'll do it for you guys so I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part I don't we'll review actually in this case I'm pretty sure I haven't I'm gonna feel not high at all uh maybe the taste is the most important thing and the taste is [ __ ] sorry for such a bummer sorry to be sitting down and see you guys in two hours peace oh hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with you infused creations I wish I liked your products more I just think that they are garbage thank you so much for watching weeds guys I'm sorry it's been a bummer over of you but hopefully next time we'll find something a little bit better thank you so much for watching peace pretty good one too hello and thank

have to track check this stuff out you know my usual just realized it's a mess today we are going to go Stuart come on", "BGKKY_ksDgY": "today Kevin it out retrying some fruit gushers in the super sour berry mix and we're and also the shooty red hot cinnamon bears the the fruit gushers were sent to us from mish mish in Michigan she found these at 7-eleven and they were a dollar going on and then mud we found they were a dollar dollars in our stores yeah so we figured we would just combine her candy with our painting so it's this fun first at 7-eleven I have never had fruit gushers so ruined yeah it's been years mix there's mixed berry blueberry grape and raspberry eliminate in the package twelve pieces are here ten calories and there are four servings in here so I'm gonna just pour these out because I don't know what they're smaller than others accessibility and they're incredibly sticky Americans are leaking there's only three flavors so I don't know okay they're really sticky good probably yes so there's liquid in the middle yeah okay you're supposed to mess it all the way down you want Cremonese what is that people and there's raspberry lemonade Millie for us pink yeah thank you like what you know about squished so come on flavored they're very sticky nice stick in your teeth terrible nothing and that's a lemonade one yeah that's definitely lemon I kind of got a really stinky Joey be very very sticky um that was the lemonade it's very target oriented yeah yeah try to throw the red one is should be mixed berry hmm this won't look without Jim hmm you mix very well mm-hmm more cherries anything mm-hmm yeah it tastes like cherry very sticky dough mm-hmm I can't imagine giving this to a kid like that all yeah that's really unnecessary yeah I can't believe I've never heard this before mmm how long wonder what you're like I'm out no no this is very bright why'd you pick one that's here yeah mine too but overall they're not too bad the lemonade kinda struggling just cut it a little more it's tar but um yeah and they're very sticky on your fingers so if you give them to a kid and back to your car when you drive another then they're gonna be sticky over so let's keep that mom okay what we're good the flavors aren't it wouldn't be a candy but I was out all the time because there is a stick in your teeth and these are our three pieces of ninety calories these are the chewy Red Hot Chili Peppers [Applause] gimme gimme gimme gimme you know what I mean it wasn't the reason I bought these weights and weeks ago I had touched into the picture on Instagram of days and somebody came back and said does your review of them no one had even bone because I hope they would taste the same as a red wine you know what mirrors Gatorade no they're not I'm done with drama no because now I can tell you they are a good size I do like the size of huge but they move it seven years eight cuz they're all I'm not even right now and the flavor is not as strong as that no just a writer of cinnamon mean I even got a really strong scent my sister's it's cinnamon yeah however I do like say I love cinnamon and you don't get cinnamon in with other box of candies like no not cinnamon in with the guessers and I don't know if that's an allergy thing or if it's wonderful on the flavor permeated everything exactly if you put one few cinnamons in the bag when you take over the entire bag but you don't get like you don't get a cinnamon starburst or a cinnamon skills you just get jelly beans occasionally but yeah you get the spice in the spice set you'll get the cinnamon but these are ok they're just laying around your sin in that not even as stronger like a synagogue or anything no I would rather buy red hot for it on Red Hots or atomic fireballs yeah saundra uh so I will have a picture breathe in thank you so much - mish mish we're sending me the producers because I'd never had so that was a trick to be able to have something different so I hope

a train but we'll see what happens i don't really eat edibles ever so you've never eaten edibles i have before like once or twice but never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up dude he's gotta wait 40 minutes yeah no he's gonna get [ __ ] up it's 500 milligrams dude fun fun dude i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man water all right they're saying no man they don't want you to drink it all right homies aren't looking out for you huh oh we gotta do that landscape that's good well let's get oh flip the camera hold on tell me when to alright so go like this and then do it you know like just take the camera okay one two three go dude you gotta flip it man okay okay okay one two three go okay we flip okay so connor just the results are just bad he just he got so [ __ ] up and uh it just didn't feel right filming him he puked so we were gonna do like a one-hour check-in and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself and just only take one or two you hit the link down below and try it out for yourself and if you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "Rldtph8scbI": "hey everyone its Jared Koons and Lauren's here and today is a monumental  day tell them what we're gonna do we're going to try the starburst fries from Taco Bell and it's his first time ever trying we're also going to get the airheads one have you had that one no I have never had the Arab could be mind-blowing I'm going to do a full review we're going to compare it to the actual candy yeah we haven't got them yet so let's let's do it this we're thinking should be enough star birth and this should be enough their heads to compare the two together okay now we need to go get those beverages it's combination take the chicken is the fighting cracker shapes chicken Kylie Jenner's house good how are you yeah that's nice it's reading actually yeah we're gonna bail out thank you right being free food and beverages and beverages you know is it out of every business what happened I told you okay next up I get to starburst freezes and to airheads freezes to cybersyn to airhead yep okay give us a moment to make sure we can get those up for you okay for 2014 yes okay thanks get me seven bridge I'm really quick in the car while they're fresh because we just drove  did you're another city together here we go I already tried to plunge by because you don't love it can be used to taste more like starbursts I wasn't like a year yeah they let themselves go pretty good I don't know if it hit Legare heads are everywhere in Italy they're so pretty what the heck okay we're back we have the free urban college freeness the phrases we have this phrases and we also have the items they're supposed to represent so we're going to try these and compare them to the freezes this is the starburst if you don't know starburst is it is a fruit flavored candy I should've mentioned that in the beginning and then Taco Bell is the chain restaurant and they put these out it's supposed to represent this so we'll try to you know they have a first name down the really good 20 minutes Lauren will finish her Callie just more actually reduce want to compare the blue raspberry with the blue raspberry so this is an airhead it's supposed to be like a taffy but it's really just a stick of sugar no point he's oh no another resolved oh I know oh my god I look at my tongue holy alright it doesn't be both blue FF the speed of my life it is more blue than if somebody choked me for 12 hours straight alright now we need to try them both at the same time okay here we go is like perfume it tastes like perfume okay so now we're going to dip this in the appropriate color right yeah okay I got a pretty hefty scooper yeah look at that I like can't do it it's still in my  mouth you guys what happened was I dipped it and it froze was happy so when I bit it off I just had a rock but also frozen you know freeze whatever and then I couldn't swallow it you anything could break my teeth you were about to do it them like my only thought was I need to tell her to not do it it was struggling to get it out of my house Italy the same thing with Star Wars area already dip it in the thing okay here going your lineup this is very mellow shake let's see all over my pants we're gonna do Atlantis and see how it thank you a taste better pleasing mine tastes a little bit better so I think it has a little better that when you're embracing with someone like that it like something like in your mind like there's like an endorphin release like if you're sort of you know named like being physically affectionate with another person and like interlocking your arms it like makes it taste a little better it works for anything really so Lord's going to toss it I'm going to catch up my mouth and we're going to see if like the air

States version six pieces are 100 calories flavors and include orange strawberry lemon and raspberry and oh oh okay I wasn't expecting that at all you get you open up the big pack they do still feel like starburst yeah okay so orange strawberry lemon raspberry which county went trough our look of them uh we didn't get them all no we didn't get the raspberry that's okay quite a random thing although you would think they could want to be nice no we're those words I would have definitely thought there would have been one of each but I do want you to see we got two of the orange so people that make Mamba do better you want one oh sure are well are they gonna be that chewy [Music] they remind me of those hot shoes yes that's okay did you want they're more of a texture of a highchair yeah how did I cheat almost rubbery who's man kind of feel to them yeah they're kind of rubbery but the longer you like them in your mouth of course softly mm hmm I like what's wrong everyone mm-hmm yeah that strawberry it's just a candy strawberry flavor your typical candy strong yeah it doesn't taste like you went out to field make a strawberry now this one is the orange I really like that word now almost a baby asked for an orange mm-hmm like I'm sure people think I'm weird about saying how that was raised on baby aspirin no what did baby aspirins adults - I think I said that before yeah but we I mean I took a baby aspirin for everything it seems like I was always taking a baby in woman's job no matter to show you yeah I really like the orange this is really good really good lemon this one's scary that's good it's right there I want you you chew it probably longer mm-hmm the flavor intensifies with that one kind of intensified with all of them but I don't you and you know what I'm so glad leg every stupid yeah I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to try the raspberry I'm sure that your raspberry are really really good um but we at least we got two of our favorites but I like the other ones as well I like though it's even the lemons on that it's not super like tart right it's up make it pop Arabian right it's pretty decent yeah so thank you Lauren and Susan thank you so much this you know we love trying new candy so this was fun and I hope everyone else enjoyed this and thanks for watching [Music]", "uwuUCZh0IYU": "and welcome to another episode of carbs genre cuisine Joe show us in the car NBS wall consume the carbs go ahead and follow me on twitter and instagram at Mads I know we both links are in description down below we are returning to the sour patch kids gum and trying the extreme version so this is sour Pat's patch kids extreme blue raspberry gum this is just they had the regular gum and it wasn't extreme well now like they've made it extreme that's a little that's a little weird to me I don't I don't quite understand like what makes us different unless maybe it's supposed to be like a more sour version alright so I've got that thing open now it took like four hundred and twenty three years got try two sticks to this that's usually what I do with these types of gum just because the flavor usually goes away like right away so you've got a those aren't even leaks I have no idea what those lyrics actually would be in this day and age so that's what it looks like let's see what makes these extreme no that's a little one more shower unusual that is continually pretty sour especially for a gum it's not weird sour or anything that packs a sour punch that's way more sour than regular the regular gum and also sour patch kids in general oh because it's gum as you're chewing it and moving around we keep getting packets of sour it's really good but you've got to be ready for the Robert De Niro face Wow oh I'm still going whoa I had to get rid of it alright I like it that is great I've always wanted like I'm like a really sour gum but not to the point where it's just not enjoyable that is right below the threshold of just possibly going over the top being too enjoyable it's just perfect amount of sour delicious I would rate that a very high four out of five I like them a lot I will keep that and I will pop some of that gum every once in a while even though it's for kids this just look sour adults sour patch adults that's what I want to see all right well there you go guys I got this at stater brothers there's only like a dollar they had it along with all the other gums so I assumed the other gums are doing well also if they come out with variants like this but either way what are you thoughts on this let me know in the comments down below and we'll see you on the next episode", "VoEWX6tiGxU": "today Kevin that are going to be trying for Kellogg's nutrigrain bars these have been around for a while but they are new to me and I'm going to be honest I'm just loving them I bought the pumpkin and I'm crazy about them I have the chocolate raspberry I've never had a chocolate on before the mixed berry blueberry am sure now the blueberry and cherry I've tried however I have not tried them in a video and I don't know that Kevin is a job Kevin's never had so went out the reason I'm gonna try them for you in a video is just because I want you to be able to see the inside of them see what they look like I want you to get Kevin's feedback so these the chocolate raspberry I've only seen these at Kroger in our area have never seen the chocolate was at Walmart cousin Newton they were do this in your name oh cool they were 250 at Kroger and then those 278 son is in Walmart at Walmart so these just happen to be on sale at Kroger so that's a good deal you can go for 250 let's start with the cherry collectors and these are all Softbank bars I don't know if they're all the same no I know they're not so we'll just they are 120 calories that's another thing that these news reports enter 20 calories for this bar it just says it says naturally an artificially flavored made with real fruit and whole grains it has 12 grams of sugars so there's a big big news it does that's exactly what it looks like okay whole grains good source of fiber make this real threat no high fructose corn syrup so it's a good source of fiber sandwich fiber does it have 3 3 grams which is more than a lot of words that I aged as one fellow it has a go Fig Newton without the things you know it's serious effect with the outside coating the bread it takes two layers dignity I think that's a delicious I love the cherry flavor of it and there's plenty of it in there it's thick and then you all right you get that outside coating that's like a almost like a soft cookie coating it's very good it's softer the decision but that's the flavors remaining the Signet now this is the blueberry and it's also 120 calories so both the cherry and blueberry here 20 calories mmm wrong I'm so glad Kevin strongly and to me to me this is a low calorie snack you know we're gonna throw it 120 120 you can't be 220 calories for all this it's a lot of flavor through the bar we think that since then definitely tastes like blueberry mm-hmm he's just like the cheering sentence weird but you have to be a fan you would have to like blueberry to like though it's such a good flavor I love it it's a good strong berry flavor though and I actually like the blueberry better than cherry goes a little stronger flavor flows a little stronger I'm trying to say this is mix very this next other key it's got blueberries and cherries and strawberries on the picture well it says apple puree I think that what happened your rage is together okay I'm trying to see it's apple puree concentrate strawberry puree concentrate blueberry puree buzzes right so it has strawberry blueberry apple oh and here's another one raspberry yeah there's a picture of raspberry yeah so the only thing it didn't show really was the apple yeah and I don't know how much flavor that's gonna Apple strawberry blueberry raspberry that's cool okay these are also under 20 hemorrhoids so the fruity ones are 120 calories now I've never had the mixed berry it's okay we don't like it as well yeah it's just okay the flavors all just kind of merged together where it's you get a you get a flavor but you can identify any in the flavor and honestly there's a little it's more chemically types into me no it's a it's a yeah it's a more chemical yeah I'm careful yeah I mean I'll lay them gonna hide themselves you got paste them next to whole things they may taste they may taste nothing but try them after the blueberry and a cherry it does stand out so there's no competition there it was just yeah yeah okay in these thank you try new I've never had these before I got proof times cons all burgers together into one like flavor this will finish it feels good yeah okay this is chocolate raspberry made with real chocolate and whole grains these are 140 calories raspberry puree concentrate I'm curious trouble recipe chocolate raspberry I'm curious what the chocolates gonna taste like not very good it's a bitter chocolate as well it is it's better this tastes like a cocoa it tastes like some of those health bars they've had yeah and now I'm I get more about graininess the other ones were more of a smoother like a cookie texture with a little bit of that one's more like grainy like they're not little grains of something yeah yeah and it's got cocoa flavor not a chocolate right yes yeah it's not a sweet chocolate at all you know we've had some bars in the past some health healthy bars that have had that flavor once again they see is you know I'm like trying to give those away I might see you know what I might see if for sale once both of these to be honest because why would I why would I want to subject myself to we've eaten one out of aged 14 days that's how many bars are left why would I want to go through somebody 14 days you know yeah I've done that before though eaten things that have just okay these I really just don't want so I'll see if she wants all the other to go our winners that is by far the best the chair is closer and for me it's there were just even though both so so good I would eat over any any time they annoyed I would I would take those I follow all day long I would just leave these out so I hope you enjoyed the review and thanks for watching", "LMTzxpmUDlA": "hi everyone you all are having a big day today okay retake hi everyone I just kind of wanted to make this video I'm going to be doing an eyebrow tutorial not really like a tutorial like I am NOT a new guru I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing kind of like an eyebrow tutorial slash edible review slash me just [ __ ] around so I am getting ready because my brother is performing down on sunset today and I have to get ready because I'm going to go and support him Josje oh sure my eyebrows or something that's like really important to me like in high school if I didn't wear makeup at all I at least had my eyebrows build it that's the most important thing your eyebrows shape your face like there I just can't stress enough they're just one of the most important things as far as your makeup routine so I am going to be reviewing I have some kiddo candied pineapple flavored sativa gummies I have never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with agar locust bean gelatin glucose cane sugar closed strings citric acid capsule and not just it contains you know food allergies whatsoever however are not vegan they don't stay organic they're definitely not kosher but they need all the requirements like their lot tested free of metals [Music] Oh two hours later everywhere yeah I think this is better than I know that there's CVT in years [Music] one of the best combinations you can do and I can I [Music] really like they see this on the party [Music] [Music] [Music] wait huh is purple [Music] this is like a cute I hope you enjoy this video as much as if you know did I enjoy it though you know when you guys thought in the video under the honking time other brothers [Music]", "oqp-YnK850E": "freeze dry candy is what we're doing today guys we have these four candies and we're going to freeze dry them we got trolley sour brite crawlers they're basically gummy worms really good skittles that are already open starburst we have starburst they are really really good and we have these may or may not be opened already yeah we couldn't help ourselves anyway so we just got a freeze dryer we're so excited we watched videos from king of random and they have a freeze dryer and they've done some of these and i could not wait to do it for ourselves so i cannot wait to do skittles it happens in my favorite candy of all time and these are said to be amazing when they're freeze dried because they can swell up and get so delish so we're going to put these on the trays really want to pick one twizzlers i'm really excited to see that one yeah i'm thinking you're gonna need more room maybe maybe like that i wonder if there's gonna be like white spoon it's like the elusive white skittle oh is that a good omen do you know in the in the what in the history they actually use beetle wings to make the red you still want skittles oh look at this one what is this this is my skittles where's the quality control what is this i mean it's got like it's got like layers was it was it a skittle hmm she's got it all right let's see when we rip this if it will get any bigger in the freeze dryer okay cool and we'll place these up here i've already made a smaller face right there bob oh man can you smell that it smells like berries in there smells good okay so i'm just gonna organize these smells delicious i've never had those my kids love these but um oh my gosh it's gonna take forever i know it's good that took me forever oh wow yeah i'm gonna get a lot of red pink's back hey what's in the wonder toy right here okay guys so we have our candies all splayed out here and i wanted to show you that i put parchment paper down here because some of these candies get very sugary what are you doing you're very happy um they get very sugary and so i don't know what it would do to the tray maybe nothing but i've seen other people put parchment down so that's what we're doing and i think these are going to be great so maybe we should cut this into smaller pieces what do you think you want to get a knife these i don't know the texture but i think they'll get doubled in size too and these i'm really excited about because i think they get like cheeto size like bigger than that actually and maybe very airy like a cheeto like a cheeto puff oh okay what is that that's that food i'm just going for like a couch i'm scared yeah everything is under control um trust me i'm a professional oh my god all right guys it is time to put these in our freeze dryer i'm not a freaker our freeze dryer okay let's go got our candy in and i'm just going to insulate this all right close the door and press start we'll be back in 24 hours process is complete is negative 33 degrees see what it looks like oh okay so i'm gonna use my hot holders here or my whatever you call this thing oven look at that so it's been 24 hours i riley has not seen these i actually took them out of the freeze dryer a few minutes ago and we're gonna do a reveal and just see her reaction because they're amazing you ready for this we're sticking what happened your eyeball isn't that neat i know it's like a sugary cheeto i cannot wait to try that one and these it was funny i thought these would get ginormous like triple or quadruple in size and it did nothing and it did not even freeze look at that that did not freeze did these freeze no they're still squishy this is our biggest cheeto gummy worm thingy my bob and the rest of them this one oh my gosh it looks like a shrimp for real um this one was bigger i feel like they are absorb this one is absorbing the air while i was out here uh the moisture the air and the moisture um so it's like a regular worm again that's weird look at that it's absorbing the moisture so it's going back to look at that i'm gonna try it you hear that did you hear that so apparently we need to let it go dry more because they shouldn't be absorbing the air and it shouldn't be shrinking like that so this just shows you that we should have put it straight into a baggie instead of letting it sit out here for about 20 minutes um so next time we'll film immediately so you can really see the size that it was because this is just too cool and we want them to say their size and we'll just put them in some kind of container or baggy or something but uh let's taste some of these because i'm really excited i'm gonna try an eyeball or or it's like a what is that what shape is that bite spike oh and like the sweet factor has like gone up so like i can't even finish that it's so sweet okay i want to try one of the ones no you left you left the not puffy part that tastes like cotton candy okay red i like the red one oh oh i broke my tooth look at the inside we actually still have some of these in the wrapper i'm going to see what it looks like compared because there's a lot of a lot of little holes in there where it has puffed that's the size until it puffed to that which is not that much however this one's still chewy and flexible and this one is not i just popped my knuckle i don't know you just played with it and that was a little bit of hair on it i have this glass of water and we're gonna see if this will dissolve it floats i wonder if this one a float because it's more dense nope it sinks look at that that's cool well it's kind of doing a dance down there oh look at that yeah look at that", "uODdpLsRE70": "against some Smokies cannabis infused peach Fruit Chews that somehow came from California with me and then I'm here with my boss super chronic

you even know no all right what would we need to find out you want three more no I'm gonna really well I had a hundred so maybe 200 okay okay so from a flavor perspective though what do you think the flavor was good there's a very very slight hint an earthy tone at the end I think that's the oil okay they could probably pump up the peach a little bit but I'm pump H pump up the peach yeah I'm glad

ours um and every dog in this house and almost every human in this house - and how it's affected us but let me tell you about six six years ago I hit my head and end up being my six concussion I had to quit my job I couldn't drive for a very long time I had vertigo spells I had migraines I had this constant ringing in my ears I couldn't sleep it was it was crazy it was a tough time not just for me but for everyone involved in my life you know I was going to doctors and all that they were giving me all these prescription pills antidepressants anti-anxiety stuff for my migraines stuff for my motion sickness and I'm taking all these pills at once and while they were helping those symptoms it was giving me side effects that I didn't want to deal with so I just stopped taking them all together and like I said it was a really rough time um I had to see an occupational therapist a physical therapist speech therapist I was having trouble tying my shoes I was having trouble forming sentences it was just a really man it was just like starting everything all over again it was like being a little kid um and I learned to manage it through the years but if I did too much if I you know eventually got to drive but if I drove too much I put all my feet too much I mean I would just hit a wall it was pretty bad and finally uh our friends over here at koi presented this product to us and it wasn't even for me at the moment or at the time it was for a dog named Wally and Wally had he's old beagle I'm sure most of you he had busted a Ciel's he was just he was just a mess he was he was an old guy but we started giving him coy and it actually kept him nice and comfortable for the last four months we had him he was actually playing with a ball chasing a ball up until the last day that he was with us and you know we're all talking about it one day and it was brought up to my attention that maybe I should just try this stuff for me to see what it does and I figured it probably wasn't gonna work but I was gonna give it a shot anyway uh so I did and I've been on this stuff for three months now and I'll tell you what it's not managing my symptoms at all because it has eliminated all my symptoms um everything's gone I feel like I did when I only had five concussions which was pretty good um I have more energy I fall asleep faster I wake up faster overall I'm in a better mood um I haven't had a cigarette in like three months since I've been using it um and overall it's just been it's just been really good for me I feel good and this is why I'm telling you guys

uh and i love them and uh again we can certainly talk about if these are beer or not and that's interesting um it is a nice change of pace um my man max put it that way in a comment he said you know like he said a lot of things but the thing that relates to this anyway is yeah sometimes really people who drink different styles of beer like different styles of beer myself included it's a nice change of pace it's definitely a nice and i would add delicious change of pace let's get into it yeah i mean it's it's not going to give you a lot of head all right so strawberries raspberries blueberries blackberries fluff coconut i mean looking at it it's making my glass dirty minus one point actually there's a little bit of a reddish pink head you see some pectin stick in the side glass already not a lot of head and i didn't think there would be much but it definitely does look like a a smoothie or like a you know in your blender typically if i'm blending berries it's to make a smoothie that's where my mind goes it does look like you bought a bag of frozen uh bare you know variety of berries assorted berries blended it up i mean that's the color that is so yeah i'm not particularly surprised by the color let's see about the aroma i actually get a decent amount of coconut i figured with and i don't know the ratio of things that they put in i was thinking i was going to get a berry explosion first but actually that coconut is fighting its way and it's really nice with the the fruity element that's there that coconut is super refreshing i kind of expected this to be super jammy and then maybe fighting for some coconut but no that is not the case i'm finally getting some of that jamminess it's pretty sweet too like it's not it's not letting on a lot of you know tart or sour characteristics i think this is one of those beers if you were doing it blind you you wouldn't think when you tasted it was gonna be sour but like i mean i i know it's going to be but like yeah basically aroma i mean there's just there's so much sweetness there's also like this vanilla thing i don't know if they do lactose in these beers or not it's not labeled so it could be the fluff i guess but it has a nice dude it has a nice vanilla note yeah i mean i guess it'd be nice to have a little bit more like of the berries just because i had so many different berries and i love berries but i bet it'll come come across in the taste there's only one way to find out cheers thanks again joe now it tastes what i want it to taste like yeah you do get that awesome sour and tart thing going you do get a lot of the berry it's a pretty good mix of the berries like again you know trying to think when i do these reviews um you know going in as blind as possible i can't hear because i know exactly what's in it but if i was doing this beer blind i probably wouldn't be able to pinpoint a fruit or a berry i mean it's very much berry uh probably because of the tartness i would say blackberry and or uh raspberry just because that's with the base beer and the berriness that's where my mind would go but like the fact that it's all for you know anything i know that all four are there but i could see you know maybe moments that were oh that's strawberry or whatever but it's it's definitely like a nice berry medley with that tartness so it's leaning in my opinion anyway a little bit and strawberries can be that way blueberries for me it's very rare that i get a tartness um it's very much that raspberry blackberry thing the coconut that i was dwelling on in the aroma definitely not a dominant taste it's funny now that i've had some i'm getting a little bit more of the berry in the aroma the coconut is there it's just it was a misdirection a mislead from the aroma but it's actually kind of nice i don't think i would get palette fatigue if this was just the berry but it might be a little boring of a beer indiscriminate or indiscriminate unidentifiable berry characteristics i guess is what i'm trying to say it's delicious might get a little old to review or talk about so now it has that coconut thing too adding another layer some more depth to it uh making a little bit more interesting to drink that's for sure um that vanilla thing i was getting aroma that i thought maybe was the fluff or lactose again i don't know if these are lactose or not i'm not getting that really in the taste at all um there is some sweetness to it it could be from the fruit it could be from the fluff so that's hard to say but i really like this i i i'm and again i i think that coconut is the hero here and again not that i think this beer will be delicious about the coconut just over crystal clear this beer is phenomenal but i think that coconut is adding a needed layer of depth i i'm thinking of like cuisina when you're cooking and like there might be something good but then you put a little bit of salt or pepper whatever spice it's like oh yeah that is making this even better it's already good you know so it's kind of like that thing this would be good without it but i think it's taking it up a notch thanks again joy really appreciate it um you guys had

up CBD lovers welcome back to I love CBD alright so today is the long-awaited koi CBD Cummings reviews maybe not long-awaited for you but for me I was actually looking forward to doing this video this is it right here koi CBD gummies some very bold claims on the package it says America's best tasting CBD gummies by America's most trusted CBD brand definitely bold claims and you know we'll see how it holds up to these claims so this is the package this is a package it was just six I'll show you what the gummy looks like they only have a couple left yeah so they are round like this just a gummy it says coy on it even though for some reason I could have swore the first one I took didn't say anything on it I was looking forward to say coy like the picture but it didn't say anything so anyways these are the gummies there are six of them in this package total of 60 milligrams and packaged so each gummy has 10 milligrams of CBD and you know right off the back you take its gummy and the taste is okay it's not bad does have an aftertaste just like I don't know it's not it's not a sweet taste it's kind of like a little bit of bitterness or something or like yeah yes it's not a sweet taste there's definitely a very strong aftertaste but you know it's something you can deal with it's not something very terrible how are the effects on these gummies the effects are okay not bad you can definitely feel a calming effect definitely feel the anti stress and anti anxiety that you expect from CVD muscle relaxation and possibly some pain relief and stuff like that so the effects for a 10 milligram gummy are not bad now I don't have much to compare to as far as coming skull these are the first gummies 4cb gummies that I tried so the only thing that I compared to its capsules which is the same for more method of you know ingestion and comparing it to capsules it's okay you know it holds up it's not the top top or best but it's okay so just gonna keep this pretty short and if if I was to give us a rating my rating for this will be 4 out of 5 stars I don't mind that I would buy it again some reason it just keeps me how much I got this for I want to say it was like around 10 bucks or something no it wasn't ten bucks it was close to ten dollars I don't remember exactly how much it was it could have been ten dollars but a totally escaped it I mean totally escapes my mind right now so yeah that the price for it's just six gummies was not high but then again only has six gummies in there they do have a bigger package that I think has like 30 in there or something like that which is more expensive but I just wanted to try them out so this is it for koi CBD CBD gummies and my rating is 4 out of 5 stars I hope you find this useful if you're looking into buying these and if you like this video give it a like if you are not already subscribed and you like CBD like we do then subscribe and you stay updated with all my reviews all right I'll see you in the next video and I got some pretty exciting coming up and I'll see you guys later happy CBD", "MnXTa5PUQLY": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying some airheads these are mini bars paradise blends they were 329 at Kroger for this bag it is a 12 ounce bag and it has blue hawaiian cherry pineapple blast raspberry lemonade citrus rush and a white mystery flavor it says take your taste buds on a tropical vacation no passport required three bars 34 grams is a hundred and forty calories so so there's the mystery listen how many of you get of each because I'd say that everybody kind of varies so it'll take you how many we got in our bag but that doesn't mean it's gonna be that way in your bag because normally hey these were made in Erlanger Kentucky they're made by Perfetti Van Melle USA Inc other languor Kentucky normally it says if you might not get all the flavors but I don't see that on this side so maybe you will get the same in up now Shirley time oh good grief Willie got two of those one two three we got 14 mystery I hope the mysteries are good and we got three of the Blue Hawaiian three six of the cherry pineapple and I said two of the citrus in seven of the raspberry lemonade so let's try the mystery one first yeah and these are white as you can see we've had mystery before however because this is a different mix they might have changed you I'm cutting them to make them smaller so the only thing you're chewing on video format yes we're gonna Mele now would void half of it immediately it's a way to control how much water mom that's what it is it's watermelon hmm no its water no what a matter tropical no it's definitely watermelon no it's definitely Mormon when I first met my mother is this gonna be pineapple the pineapple for ya I think it's me it is watermelon ah yes it's definitely definitely 100% watermelon these are also from a peanut and tree nut free facility because I know we have some viewers who they or their kids cannot have peanuts let's go like that one of those goods and the texture was soft and Bernie yeah it's like yeah yes it would remind you of a Jolly Rancher Doraemon it really and it comes through stronger after you've swallowed it this is the blue Hawaiian sweet it looks like a slushie color the blue slushie yes these two we think you get a bag of these this isn't the kind of thing that you want to leave in your car on a hot day uh-huh because then when you get the bike home they're gonna be stuck to the wrapper and you don't want that that would be a good drink my brother had a bunch of those in those the white well yeah watermelon is not one that I would choose all the time but the blue is really good but I do yeah I do like the blue one more I wouldn't say it like raspberry no it's like a it tastes like a I swear P or some flavor you would get in one of those frozen drinks - yeah yeah I guess that's why I said that yeah it tastes like something you would drink this one is fresh it's like a Nickelodeon green because a it looks like flora no my new clothing as well that's the great good thing we only got a few of those yeah that's why they only gave me two that's terrible looks like great for it oh yeah don't know why you want that sour berry cobbler so yeah make sure it doesn't say it just says citrus rush I think it's supposed to be lime and lemon and orange but it doesn't taste like it tastes like very firm it tastes like grapefruit and the Blue Hawaiian was lemon and cherry and something else moving thing yeah that's like an orange but they tell her to play and I didn't and that green would I would never have no no water it's terrible it's like it's it's like a great phrase no you don't like very fruit I can't imagine what and grapefruit here penny this is raspberry lemonade and it has raspberry and lemon that's what's in here and it is a pretty like hot pink color thank you [Music] oh that's nice it takes a man to hate you just like the watermelon at the beginning it's like you don't really get that full watermelon until you swallow it no that's good so you're wondering what it is that's the side why it takes a minute but once you get the raspberry it's really very stronger miss Manion that's another one that can be a drink that would be a good drink this is cherry pineapple blast and it just has cherry and pineapple like if you got a sonic you can kind of get your own mixture of the wolf drinks and they say you can mix anything that's not science oh yeah I for one of those I love this color mmm smell it's very nice I got Viktor I get busted pipe oh yeah and it takes a minute to get that point / - I get a lot of cherry unless though I get a water chair gonna be now alright first it's all pineapple yeah when it it's like it sounds gross but you're eating it and it gets in your tape so you swallow it then you seals I still have some what's in your teeth good so when you swallow it you get that flavor but then you continue to get that flavor out of your teeth and so that cherry keeps coming back and I really really like that cherry ah the only one I don't like it's the citrus rush and they only gave us two it's like they knew there was like we made these and we made a mistake so we're gonna divvy some out throughout these bags to get rid of them because we're never going to make you some people love them if you love them that yeah we're a priority cuz I hope you get a bike home cuz I did not like the best ones were the blue the blue rice wear him down blue the wine the people my favorite one out of all of them was probably the raspberry lemonade man was the blue and then my second one was cherry pineapple no really alright and then my third one would be the blue one I would go blue pink red I would go pink red blue yeah yeah the same ones were our favorite it's just a different combination so they're good I mean it's a good bag I think it's a good I think so - I think it was 329 I think it's well worth it you get a lot of candy yeah kid Zoey beating on this for a while yes and there's an F in here too that we like even the mystery ones they were watermelon they weren't or a favorite but they're still a really good watermelon but flavor if you like watermelon a lot so the only ones for us that would get wasted is these two so you'll have to let us know if you've got a bag of these and you can't go out which most people probably don't but did you get the same amount in your bag I would think they would all be a little bit so I'm gonna have a picture parade at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "fNiVFvhg5fA": "what's up guys today we got another ejuice tribute to you and what we have Jess hey pink Chu by propaganda e-liquids so when you look this up by you can't get it on the propaganda site and it's not usually listed under propaganda it's listed under the brand pink that's their line with the three flavors it's cookie butter like swirl is the other one this is actually my favorite juice IVF it every day so you already know what my opinions of it's gonna be but you can watch my vape it anyway and you can see what he thinks about it so pink shoe is a pink starburst flavored eliquid if you buy this juice in store it's gonna be a little bit more expensive twenty to twenty-five dollars in local brick-and-mortar stores but if you go online we actually found a website called I drove a juice calm and they have kind of a wholesale to customers type thing going on and we were able to get 100 ml bottle of this juice for $15 so without further ado let's baby it's already about eight this is what I make all the time it was already in the tank joke's on you juice I'd rip it too much but you were reacting to the flavor I have tasted this juice a lot as we both said it is her favorite juice she has always got it on her she's always got it loaded in pretty much every atomizer taste like it a little bit at this point it seeped into the steel of the things that she uses to vape with that being said I actually like the juice it's not my favorite it is her favorite but if you have to vape it for a long period of time I think it's a good juice for that I usually vape it every day until I get papers tongue or something in the nest which is something else for a few hours maybe a day and I go right back to it my overall opinion of this juice is it's a three and a half out of five obviously - five out of five I don't know if it tastes exactly like a pink starburst but it tastes like a strawberry candy and like a taffy alright guys this is Dan hey Jess with fog rotten if you like this video go ahead and like subscribe if you want to see more reviews and tutorials you can find us on instagram at fogg rotten or facebook thanks for watching", "T332aA3WbIk": "hello wanted to share something that my wife discovered that maybe not a lot of people know but when you go out and purchase your blueberries there's something cool you can do a lot of times you need to clean them before you use them but if you're gonna do that you want them you know here boom what you can do is float your blueberry first and what's gonna happen here do a little shake these blueberries let it rise into the top they're gonna be sour maybe unripened don't ask me why I'm not a chemist give this another little stir just give that give it a stir pop you didn't mean to do that I'm not used to filming and trying to do so and you'll just see it you'll have some rise to the top and of course I can't prove this on camera but this one it's bitter one of these ones down in the bottom here nice and sweet so no know why but it's a neat little trick to separate your blueberries out and give some a little more time to ripen them up but you'll have to go through that stir it about three or four times depending on any blueberries you have until you get them all separated pretty cool little trick though have a nice day people", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis

I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

flavor is new ice flavor and let me just tell you this funny story this is why I wanted to get this once I got this is that family we're a douchey jackman and I didn't do a man to know because I didn't have my channel man but I knew that you open the lid and you squeeze it and I thought all that so so I don't think that should be like that I just I didn't know but then I looked on YouTube because I thought there was something wrong and I typed in douchey drop pop candy bluegrass flavor I'm gonna watch a video of someone opening it it was a long way underneath here which you whatever pull out lick it and then squirt the liquid on there and I thought I felt so silly I'm not threw it away as well when that liquid was half-full and I just saw damn it so that do stuff is still somewhere in the world so I just thought right I'll get one and I'll show you guys and you guys can try it with me a new thing to try my channel right okay so I can smell it and my favorite my favorite flavor is blue raspberry and this is blue as it says blue rat which means blue raspberry and they do strawberry and I don't know what all the favorite but they did I did sour a strawberry one at the shop but I got this I wish you guys could smell this right now okay so yeah as you can see it was 99 people asked one day I don't wish so I think you got time to pull this lid off if you can and this is a blast let's just try it it says extremely sour in the back so let's try it let's try it with a Molly now alright so we pull this out last night rapper rapper it's all wrapped up and the lapis eyes drop pop pop pop drop all right here we go how's it go on let's take the lower eye so we got all lower and we got a squirt at this one Nosa was the liquid oh my gosh so nice that always really nice and then if you want to stir it like that you can just keep it inside there shut the lid there we go back to the beginning see what fine again but black no these are best loli I've ever tried guys by the way you should get one of these guys straw I've never tried to strawberry one day I will I tried to do it on my channel but today I tried de who has a really nice guy so I recommend you to try this but not just the liquid on its own with them not the liquid on its own with the lolli sure you should try it hey guys so yeah yeah I remember Menace for you guys if you're not like one two three four five over over four okay guys", "IS4Q1l-VuCM": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the jello sours these are the blue raspberries and mine are the watermelon these were two dollars each at meijer and they were in the refrigerated section so um get a little cup they are 70 calories per cup no i don't think that's bad at all do you want to go first sure it is a very pretty blue these are made by a craft times and it says visit us at jello gel hypheno.com i got a little bit sour blue raspberry no high fructose corn syrup and no artificial preservatives or sweeteners it's good it's it's i think there's more sour than flavor i know i i get the blueberry i taste the the blue rice it tastes like um there's a piece of hard candy that has a similar flavor to that mm-hmm a jolly rancher yes i think if you it's it's like they um put a jolly rancher a blue jolly random raspberry in gel that's in jello that's what it's like yes it's good it's not overly strong no the flavor's a little light for me yeah it's more like i said it's got more sourness than it does flavor but but the flavor's there you can definitely see to me i don't think it's very sour it's not no even the flavor that's what i'm saying the sour star the flavor and even that's not very no it's just for me it's just raspberry yeah that's what it is it's raspberry i think kids will like it they put sauer on it and so a lot of people might be afraid to buy it because it says sour but and this is watermelon same 70 calories per cup that's i get a hint of sourness with that but not much it's just all over them it's um honestly what these remind you of is a watered down collide uh the watermelon is stronger uh stronger watermelon flavor than the raspberry was raspberry um but it's still even though you have the flavor i still do think it's a watered down flavor flavor uh that watermelon has a green like the ron uh-huh yeah i didn't get that as much i just thought it tastes like watermelon it's not as watermelon is like it's not sweet yes it's not a sweet it's lacking the sweetness it has more of that green watermelon rind flavor and yeah i would not get that one again for me just because i would rather have a sweet watermelon and it is not sweet yeah i think these are okay i think there's better jellos out there i think these are okay for what they are um yeah i don't think this is bad i don't think they taste bad i just think that they're uh they're tamer um but just like with any jello i do think the addition of cool whip is always nice one thing about jello any of the cups of joe it's a little firmer than if you made it at home just right on your own um it's got a little bit of more of a firmness into it than the homemade jello right it's just a texture but these have been out for a while we've wanted to try and kroger uh kroger has had the blue raspberry for a long long time but they never had the watermelon and they still don't have the watermelon so then when we went in meyer and we saw both flavors it's like okay now's our time to try them because we wanted to try more than one flavor that way we can tell you buy the blue raspberry don't buy the watermelon that's exactly that that would be our advice truth be told i would buy the packages of jello and make it yourself at home because that weighs the best way yeah so but these are good for lunch boxes oh yeah i think i think they're fine for a quick snack or whatever exactly so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "dHcP7aufwcQ": "today Kevin our become two

three varieties of Jolly Rancher you today so first of all there's the hard candy and it also got Jolly Rancher shoes and last part of this is Jolly Rancher gummies and I'm guess I'm really exciting to try this out here um I'm not exactly sure that I have like every flavor and it's not many there are oh okay single spore it's red green blue and pink all right so this is on how to choose and I guess I want to strip it green apple of course now Green is normally associated with a polite thing sudden champagne a different the queen is a crepe anyways I cut its I think it's sort of academic I think there's nothing inside but let's do it ah so it's super tight and here we go you know nothing inside alright so I'm still thinking okay qui type what happen the thing is fine but might blow once

alright this is what I knew which auto review and don't tell me there's no empanada it's Apple there was one little Apple hard candy so we were lucky taste artificial flavors and yeah I come to the wrapping and then suck it mm-hmm give me a second I think no well here a blackberry paper I think I go for I'm no no no no I yes I sort of knows that the Americans like artificial flavoring but I don't like it too much I'm also not really used to it I think the words versus grape and I've tried out in a second that's great with the disaster and now raspberry oh this is awesome maybe it's very subjective whether you like it or dislike this is very good there's good oh there's also water man sherry now so I got I I'm saying the hot penny no no let's taste very good in my opinion now crepe

next time", "9C2D6rp64Mw": "hey what's up guys we've got a really cool video for you today we're going to be making rosin infused gummies the recipe is simple all you'll need is a box of jello mct oil agave or corn syrup sunflower lecithin citric acid and gelatin first things first grab an eighth of some balm weed and go ahead and pack your bag bottle tech style we are going to be smashing on the nug smasher x so we're using nug smasher x 120 micron bags the x is a dream to operate one button extractions it doesn't get any easier than this we collected our rosin and we yielded a little less than a gram next we're going to heat our x-plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit grab your d-carb capsule and throw your rosin in the rosin pot close up the d-carb capsule and put it between the plates for 20 minutes so we can activate our thc once our 20 minutes is up be very careful when releasing the plates a ton of pressure is built up in our decarb capsule proceed with caution when removing a decarb capsule from between the plates now that our rosin is ready to infuse we are going to add 10 milliliters of mct oil to our beaker add low heat to help the rosin infuse with the oil now that our mct oil is infused we're going to add a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin and we're going to stir it until it fully dissolves into our mct oil once our oil is ready we'll set it aside so we can start making our gummies first things first we're going to add 1 3 cup of water to our beaker next let's add a quarter cup of agave to our water you can use corn syrup if you like we chose to use agave instead go ahead and turn on your magnetic stirrer next we're going to add a half packet of jello you can pick any flavor you like we decided to go with lemon add one packet of knox gelatin to our mix next we are going to add a quarter teaspoon of citric acid let the mixture stir for five minutes on low heat so that the gelatin can bloom and all of the mixture looks consistent and doesn't have any clumps and for the final step we save the best ingredient for last we're going to add our mct oil and let that infuse with our gummy mixture grab your gummy molds and spray them with cooking oil using a dropper carefully fill all your molds let them sit out for about 30 minutes and then place them in the fridge for another 30 minutes let your gummies aerate for 24 to 48 hours to achieve maximum gumminess this will also help with storage bon appetit your weed infused gummies are ready to eat thanks for watching and don't forget to keep calm and smash on nug smasher rosin made simple you", "eyY4oTOaYrA": "well how do you do to YouTube it's your friendly neighborhood hosts in vapor matt with northern Cali vapors back to you guys with another EGS review you guys once again so uh this was sent to us or me I mean bad general but he's not here to make for the review unfortunately we're kind of doing split reviews helped get a certain juices out of the way but make long story short this was sent by premium vape supply.com you can find this over on premium vape supplies website have to just go over and check out the price and everything like that it's a great website if you have not checked it out I suggest you go check it out right now make sure you leave their link down in the description and you have give yourself a pat on the back is there one of my favorite websites by juice from but make long story short so this is bazooka sour straws not sure if you read by the label yet the [ __ ] there we go so you can see it to focus right there Zuka sour straws this comes in a three milligram 200 milliliter bottle 200 milliliters so when you thought one-hit wonder was a lot of juice think of this guy so yes you're probably going to want to make a solid decision before you even purchase this so anyways what is the bazooka sour shells I have I'm pretty sure they have strawberry watermelon and blue raspberry this is the blue raspberry that was sent to me it comes in a big old box like that nothing like the one-hit wonder actual like plastic container like golf or a tennis ball container I want to call it um and you get to 15 mm ah I can't even talk right now to 15 ml unicorn bottles if you're wondering what's with sunglasses I'm just trying this new light it's pretty freakin bright as well as you can see so I'm just trying to see if I mean of course it's blinding me so I need the glasses and stuff but I'm just trying to see if the light gives overall better lighting to the video but anyway so let's go ahead do this like we always do on a scale of 0 to 10 will write the vapor production roadhead overall flavor give it a smell I'll just talk about good my overall opinion on it of course my opinion is going to be different than everyone else's so always keep that in mind that taste is subjective so so really want to get from this I get the blue raspberry I get the almost like the gummy flavouring I get that sour flavor in the background it's kind of what I imagined what it would have been blue raspberry mixed with gummy flavouring which I mean there are a lot of juice companies they either make gummy bears with it or they make some type of gummy candy that's the flavouring they add to it and then they have that sour extract flavoring added to it so smells pretty good but a lot of blue raspberry juice is coming out lately in my opinion like way too many I mean think about it there was air head factory just review that one that's a blue raspberry modest vapors was a blue raspberry gummy as well you have a Candy Man that we reviewed which is blue raspberry taffy man has a blue raspberry like they're just so many blue raspberries out there it's never like blueberry or something different so as you can see it comes to this huge-ass bottle this like little tip this [ __ ] thing makes a mess so I do not suggest you carrying this around and just dripping from this I like to fill up the 15 mil the 15 ml doesn't make as much as a [ __ ] mess is the big-ass bottle biz that it's like weird it's like you'll go to drip and then as soon as you turn it over it's like a little volcano the spouts still like like [ __ ] squirt and [ __ ] like damn dude getting excited so using the vape in with twisted 420 Triple E 18 650 parallel box mod I've been using this a lot lately I know some of you guys are like damn dude he always uses that box I just really like it I can throw any set a fuse Clapton's I've built on here and they just fire amazingly so I don't have to [ __ ] around and figure out the wattage anything like it's just long as the batteries have a good charge put it on wick it drip and I'm ready to go so with this juice how does it taste that's question I've been vaping I vape like a full 15 ml bottle of this already just so I can really get a good evaluation an idea on it and I don't like um why do you explain why I don't like it though because there's a good reason for one it's not the best blue raspberry I've had I mean I guess all the blue raspberry flavorings they seem to nail them right on the spot the flavoring of it so it really boils down to whether the Taffy flavoring and it's good and what the overall background under tones of flavors are with this it's not too sweet of a juice it's got more the sour flavoring in it and with any juices that you've ate that I've had sour flavoring it in it if you think to yourself I'm not sure if you can but for me in my opinion they almost have like a sour bile burn to them once you bait them too much you start getting heartburn almost it's just not my type of juice it really like it's my stomach starting to burn and then my esophagus really starting to burn I have no idea why I think it's the sour flavoring and I've had juices like that before which just had way too much sour flavoring in it and it does it almost does replicate the flavor of you know some sour straws because you get the sour flavor and on the outside and everything it's not too sweet compared to sour it's more sour than sweet but just over it's too sour for me I mean the flavor is good don't get me wrong but just overall you're gonna get that almost for me Harper and that I get from it um what I was going to say is is to as well it's a good bottle I mean it's a huge 200ma bottle so I mean if you find it on sale mean I suggest you probably go buy it I don't know how the strawberry in the watermelon oh I bet you they're better and stuff I wish I would have been able to try one of those cuz blue raspberry I've just had so many blue raspberries lately I'm just kind of burnt out off of them but uh it's not bad overall I'm gonna give this juice I honestly want to say probably probably 7 out of 10 it would have gotten an 8 if it wasn't so sour now it would have been an 8 if it wasn't so sour so I'm gonna give it a 7 but what I was going to say is that if I probably would have been burned out off of blue raspberry flavors at this point I would have given an even higher rating so I mean that probably has an effect right there so maybe leave it in an 8 you know what I mean it is a good juice I have no idea the pricing on it so I'm really sorry about that I'm gonna guess it's around 50 bucks for the bottle off a premium vape supply but make sure go over and check them out and you can get 10% off using discount code n Kalia check out just NC a li um I for didn't mention the throat in on this juice it's smooth if the throat hit smooth in and out as well there's no burning nothing like that that you can think of it's just the heartburn from it completely smooth it's got great vapor production too I mean the vapor production is [ __ ] I don't know if this juice is it looks like an 80/20 the consistency of it looks like an 80/20 so I mean vapor production it's got great vapor production flavors pretty good overall no throat hit throat hits perfect as well so if you want to check it out go ahead but anyways let me wrap this up I don't want to

meet back here [Music] [Music] yeah what's up YouTube hi YouTube babe heads back again with another one of our juice reviews comparing them to the food they're supposed to taste like today we'll be looking at bazooka blue raspberry sour straws so we couldn't find any blue raspberry sour straw candies but we got these blue raspberry sour belts and these blue raspberry sour Pharaoh's so let's eat and vape and we'll let you know what we think here we go so thus our belts were way sweeter and way more sour than the e-juice so we're going to compare them to the sour barrels and this juice is very close I was hesitant to buy this juice because I had the sour in it I didn't know how that would translate in an e liquid but it works it works well it's not like Tucker face sour but more like a sour patch kids sour it also has a pretty good sweetness has about the same sweetness as the barrels but way less sweeter than the sour belts we like sweet juices and this one has enough sweetness and the blue raspberry is there it's not overpowering at all but I would have liked a little bit more that blue raspberry flavor but they went more of a mellow candy and it probably appeals to more vapors this way you get sweet and sour on the inhale and then it mellows out on the exhale and you get the blue raspberry out on the exhale speaking of the sweetness this juice is very good on the coils these are coils from two days of vaping in an RDA I can vape this juice for like four or five days without changing my cotton and cleaning my coils and I can't do that with any of my other favorite juices if you buy the 200 mils they give you two 15 mil bottles so you don't have to carry around this big juice bottle these gorilla bottles are great for carrying around a juice and great for dripping after you screw off the cap that is they're also great for filling any tanks plastic squeeze bottles are my favorite for eliquid but it's always better to cut the tip a little because it comes out better and especially in the big ones if you don't cut it and squeeze it too much the pressure can make the top come off and you'll have a huge mess and that's happened to me before and it sucks when you get this juice it will come in this box and I use it to put all my captain so I like when great products come with extra packaging stuff so now they also make these in 60 MLS that's good because if you never try to juice e4 it sucks to commit to 200 ml of it and it comes in zero three and six milligram nicotine strings nothing higher so you mouth to lung vapors this is probably not for you so I like what juices tell you the ratio of VG and PG but this bottle says 20 percent PG 70 percent USP glycerine and 20 percent flavoring that makes a hundred and ten percent this is not the first time I've seen a ratio like this so will somebody please explain to me in the comments it looks like a 70/30 and that USP glycerine is supposedly a farmer grade glycerine so from what I understand it's better than the food grade vegetable glycerin but not entirely sure you can find this juice on very big vaping site like vapor DNA has the sixteen obatala for $24.99 an element vape has both 60 mil bottles for 1995 and 200 mils for 39.95 200 mils for 40 bucks wrong this is one of the cheapest uses I've ever purchased and my little local vape shop has this juice so it's everywhere it won't be hard to find this juice so of course we're going to test these and different setups for y'all we have an RTA and subong tank with bazooka in it so the flavor is about the same in an RTA but it gets even more mellow yeah and it gets even more mellow that and subong tanks so for me this juice has to be pushed at higher wattages in an RDA to get that true sour candy flavor so I would have suggest this juice for tanks I just use this to drink I usually only use our TAS so I bake this in an RTA and I think it's fine but definitely a higher wattage so if you guys budget your money for a juice then you can get 200 mils of this stuff for only 40 bucks so if you like candy vapes and you think you'll like those sour notes then this is a great a juice so this juice definitely

Italian I can't help it sorry nice", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "F38bCdCKSxE": "today Ken and I are be trying the starburst gummy versed liquid filled gummies and they say original so maybe they have a sour or something I don't know but these are original and then I have a sour patch exploders which also have a and I've never seen they don't say new or anything I'm just somehow American sweet we found both of these a twirl King the starbursts for $1 night the soundtracks were 279 know we've had some kind of South pasture had something in a little bit it wasn't like a jail it wasn't like I remember that because we thought it was a liquid and then we open it up and we got it and was like oh this is just some kind of jail a lot of people recommended these to me there are cherry orange strawberry and lemon I'm just gonna pour it out there there stick I take some of this stuff as we go probably they are there's 4 servings 130 calories for how many non paces are ya nan pieces are under 30 you have cherry orange strawberry lemon okay here's like my for cherry orange I think that strawberry and lemon okay cherry the door frame you think a dark red do they are sticky mm-hmm good flavor mm-hmm the gummies not really a gummy gummy what I preserve gumming it's more with jelly well it's a very soft coming mm-hmm it reminds me of a the texture of horeb oh but it just has stuff in the middle of it I think it's softer than a horrible horrible is more rubbery some hard on the one nice is almost like Turkish Delight texture joltin yeah chewiness but that was a nice cherry I like the flavor I love the flavor oh I want to make sure I get a ok that's this is the water peach strawberry color or one red I don't really get that burst of liquid in the middle mmm don't look for it that's so good no this burger the flavors very good but the liquid of the thing you get a liquid but when you bite into it it's not like it goes all over you in your mouth they just kind of these are so different from the original Starbucks because the original starbursts are the squares and they're really more like a hardcopy yeah so these are very very different that strawberry was also no no no orange the flavors are similar to a regular starburst love the orange mm-hmm that's good no it's not as strong as the other two though it is just your typical Orange okay me yeah it definitely is not as strong as the cherry and strawberry I didn't thing but it's still good and lemon the scary one hmm I don't know don't mind us back a little that it is right on the edge it is a very strong um it's on the edge of a cleaner but not so much that I wouldn't eat them if I bought if I was to buy another package of these I like them enough to eat them again yeah I think those are good so yeah I like these they're there I still like the original starburst better yeah so they do last longer but I like this so much definitely suck on things if you had self-control I got the draw I have to bite into it yeah the bad thing about these is that since they are sticky you wouldn't want to really just reach your hand in and like you know Mike you would yeah like a bringer of gummy so these are the sour the sweet sour patch exploiters with a splash of sour flavor they are Center filled soft and chewy candy nine pieces are ahead our dirty calories and it is a it is a back free food it does not tell you what wipers are in here so I do like it when you oh wow stinky yeah kind of its kind of yeah do you want to get another point because these are so there's there's like gel on this plate and I hate to pour this on top and this kind of smells very different smell but you know what it smells like raspberry to me or blackberry yeah it's yeah it's just it's strong okay then let the flavors those shapes a little berries yeah you get a red purple and green it does look like there's a lighter color it looks like there's a dark yeah looks like they work oh yeah and and yeah there's a light in a dark for all the purples and said yeah no okay so four colors we went to the dark remover yep em it's almost exactly the same texture is that mm-hmm go sugar real food but it has no stronger fibers have a much stronger and gain any thing in the dual them you didn't I didn't in the mountain I think there was probably I think it just all blends together make it could be with the texture of it being so tell me like I just think it's all yeah once you buy it it's just all together maksoon I think it's there I like that I like the flavor so much sorry I don't know what flavor was loose it was very good I think that could have been a cherry it could have been yeah let's try the lighter red that demo I squirted like that me to to when I did it's separate that tastes like a raspberry mmm-hmm that was delicious you think it's raspberry mmm no I think that was cherry I think the first one is raspberries cherry they all takes just like us it was very good in the flavors if you like these starbursts the flavors are ten times stronger and things and then when they say sour they're not really sour you know these are probably ripe right no [Music] that's great it's great it's great to like if it's great but it's not your typical like a hubbub of a great now later yeah it's not your typical gripe because it has a little bit of lab don't sure it's one thing though it has a little bit of that communion great grape juice kind of yeah it's it's more of a grape juice than a grape candy so that's what makes it the flavor is very strong this has been Apple does it look like yeah it's shaped like an apple well that wish I'd like the cluster right no I want these over there that revenue looks like it exactly I'm not strawberry all right Jerry that's a strawberry no the white cherry you already didn't know the pencil arrives where it could be a raspberry it could be a bunker and that's Apple yeah green apple yeah see these little pink ones have like a little bump ease on so could be strawberry or could be like a raspberry or something um anyway the flavors of the sour patch are much stronger they say sour bitter brilliant sour they have all just a touch of partners to them after eating those though if you go back to these it's amazing how much sweeter the starburst are oh yeah because I think they're supposed to be sour yes those starbursts are like we often farm wait yes and then you go to those and they they do have that sourness to them it's amazing I said I do like the server's a lot I think they're very very good but if I was to buy one again I prep on the sour patch couples because they have a little bit of a different texture and the just a little bit not a lot but a little bit and they do have that sourness that I don't know I just I my owner if your mouth with her after all a mess out and if sometimes the sour stuff hurts to the roof your mouth after a while yeah I wonder if that were true the starbursts were sticky they're very very very sick yeah these are well sealed yeah are not sticky at all yeah they did not like it because I'm sugar because yeah they did not leak leak in the slightest so much they could eat those in the movie theater yes so if you've never bought these as sour patch expires I would recommend you to go but now the starbursts the gummy bursts are good - I'm not knocking them at all I just prefer this to serve everyone so I will have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "WwWIbA_m770": "today on the candy aisle is it a gum is the candy what is it well it's actually just a gum but it kind of looks like a candy welcome everyone my name is Jeff and today I have another review for you this time of shoes in fact it's our shoes I got the traumatic candy machine just just down down down the old road here's the machine in question you can have a look at this on my phone choose sour choose in fact currently I don't really get it have a ton of information about this product choose it's our bubblegum shoes do you guys know this product I know I grew up with this product I can't put alike me remember any details about it maybe I was always just a candy vending machine candy it does come in three flavors just three orange cherry and grape although I was a little confused because I saw like they list orange cherry and grape like multiple times but here so I thought oh my god it's like 10 flavors but no it's just or ensuring grip I feel like when I was a kid I must have got these as in maybe I did just get them from a vending machine I don't know I I really thought that that these were packaged in stores but I don't know i'm looking now and this is where I find them I have not I got to say I haven't seen these in stores so I don't know um this is like a weird hybrid though and I always kind of liked it as a kid I thought it was such a neat idea but as an adult the concept is not as exciting to me so I can't wait hold on let's just figure this out this I guess these are the orange these are the cherry and that's my one grape right that I guess that makes sense you know luck of the draw when you put your quarter in one of those machines I guess right or maybe they may be there over stacks with charities I don't know looks about even to me anyway well so basically these are tiny little gum they're like little kick 'let's we're Chiclets that was a thing anyway they're like they're like little little gum only I smaller than a chiclet really right oh maybe a little bit smaller sort of this weird thin tablet shape like almost like a almost like a sweet tart like a little bit smaller than a sweet tart maybe more like like a like a rocket or a smartie you calm in the States anyway um anyway flat edges right but like kind of if you look at this way it's kind of like a little little bit of a bump here I mean on the side right anyway I just I remember always like thinking oh it's such a cool idea it's like it tastes like a candy when you first start chewing into it but then it turns into like gum you know it's kind of the whale it like a gumball has kind of that candy outer shell and then you sort of bite through that and then it turns into gum but I got to say like from my memory even from my memory like I really liked it and i liked the bad i feel like they had good flavoring but the they're so small you need to have like four of them to do any to do anything right like one of them certainly not enough to blow a bubble with or wherever oh yeah Oh My glob got these are sour all right we're just shocked it how much sour isn't that cherry boom I am ok Wow so make sure to put in my mouth and then i took i commed it this way with my teeth and like on the edges and it just it just split it just like broke apart like like a tablet candy would but then immediately it started reforming like softening and reforming into gum there was like an intense sour burst as I started chewing it one minute it's gone but just sweet now and there's still some lingering sour and not to be you know gross but like here it is guys it's just like it's a tiny little piece of gum like it's just this much gum right there's not much you can do with that as a kid I'm talking gum I'm talking well crappy gum sorry not good gum I'm talking you know baseball card gum or maybe like or uh no you know football card or hockey card you know whatever you're support card pleasure is maybe you know maybe like you'd be on big league chew but more likely it's you know it's hubba bubba or bubblicious right it's one of those two then again I still remember getting this yeah it's weird like like Flinx apart like a tablet crazy sour on the inside and then you immediately reforms as like a sweet gum hmm still have the sourdough remem oh so I would say I've got two of these in my mouth same flavor I didn't think about the cherry is good like it's a good sweet cherry I think the sour is too sour for what it is but then again this is a kid's product right this is kind of a null it's kind of got a novelty to it right because it's like got a kind of candy and then kind of kind of gum in it right we're going to put the gum aside i would say that i need four of those to make a regular sized piece of gum like not like a bubblicious hubba bubba like I'm going to start blowing bubbles like just like a regular you know whenever Trident then team on a gum let's taste the orange co that goes I think a little left sour will be good yeah okay and as expected George is not a shower or perhaps the towers just bounced a bit better I gotta say actually this whole leg there's like this texture thing as it flakes apart no no explain it it's not exactly flaking apart it's not as like it's not powdery like a like a like a tablet candy would be but it is like snapping apart in multiple places as soon as you should bite into it um I don't really like it like there's like little granular pieces of of the thing that fly off in all directions but this orange is good definitely definitely not too sour again not enough to make it worth it this is the kind of gum that you're chewing that it's way too easy to like forget about and swallow no I'm saying all right try the grape grape will probably good with shower mm-hmm yeah yeah okay I got it hmm yeah I'll grapes a nice flavor tonight a grape of gum in a while definitely like a kid's flavor of gum you notice that they just don't make can using grape very often these days but you know not a bad idea everyone's well okay in terms of style and structure I get it it's our kids doesn't quite do it for me in terms of flavor okay I'll have a pretty nice flavor aftertaste um I'm going to go for orange then grape and cherry laughs that area is really sour like surprisingly sour I mean it's only for a you know a minute or two whatever like a minute lesson minute you know a few seconds but not really not really for me the oranges is really good hardly any sour in that and it's it just a sour isn't balance properly in the in the in the cherry the grandpa is fine and it's kind of a nice almost like a nostalgia sort of feeling eating this product but this is not something i think is like a necessity you know i think that there are better gum products on the market and there's certainly better candy products on the market so for a quarter i guess it's kind of an interesting thing to try out but it's not something i'm going to go out and like recommend that you really need to try welcome to candy aisle is going to rate was it called sour gum choose or something with it

everyone my name is Jeff welcome to walk in Kenya here's a review I have for you another one yes it's nerds back again this is the surf and turf nerds with the raspberry and tropical punch variety I think that these are the only surf and turf nerds currently on the market right now there might have been other flavors but at one point but for now these are them nerds of course are Wonka Wonka brand which is Nestle and again I'm you know every once in a while I come across this we're leg I think that the problem the problem that I see in front of me is Canadian marketing because you got to get you got to get the French in here you got to get the French here you got to get the French here so you'd lose the Wonka branding off the top and and just doesn't look quite as nice as you think it should one of the things I love about nerds is the sense of play and fun and yeah sure you got the little cute little anthropomorphic nerds here they're doing some stuff some flippy flips or whatever but like this is not supposed to look like this this should be like cool all nerded out and it should be what is it it's totally tropical punch and road rash raspberry and surf and turf I'm not sure why surf and turf applies to a raspberry and a punch and I don't know isn't surf and turf like a meal where you have like a seafood and then like a red meat normally I guess you have a red here and blue is kind of like the sea maybe I don't know it seems like a weird bit but my guess is that on the Canadian packaging then whatever the Canadian marketing for or you know localization team for Nestle they just look at this and they say well this is the best we can do we've got to get all that we've got to get all that all that text in French and in English on the packaging unless we want to have special special packages just for Quebec so might as well do it pull tab here to open of course as usual and then one's kind of ripping you but that's okay here we go then we can get it that way good I can get that fixed and working see now this is gonna be stuck this one works fine this one is just causing problems okay well there you go there's your nerds let's get some of the note they look like nerds of course they look like nerds weird shaped little rock candies do you guys like nerds cuz I sure do in general mmm flavors just just pop it's got like a great sugar crunch here we go Jill and I drop that piece of paper in there now well let's see what this one looks like the raspberry um tasted great like really just jumped out at you let's try the punch Oh mmm punches all right it reminds me of whoops kinda you always loved these packaging right it's like it's kind of a hassle but there really is great when you get down right down to it like doesn't always work the way you want it to work but when it does work it works really well anyway um the punch is all right not maybe not my favorite but it's okay but one of the things I love about nerds is look at these colors look at how bright and shiny they are they've got that great glossy sort of whatever them they paint them with some sort of a varnish or something nerds just look great they're super fun I mean despite my sort of misgivings around the packaging here which is which is like an engineering masterpiece like let's be honest it really is pretty pretty awesome that they I don't know if this was invented by them or by someone else but like it's pretty flippin cool over all right you can walk around the street and these aren't gonna fall out and then and then you just got all these all these delicious candies and let's see how the mixes of the raspberry and trouble punch I think the tropical punch is good but it's not my favorite rum I like the raspberry a lot though let's try mix top huh hmm it is yeah that's okay it's alright I sort of get why they would put these these together but you know overall I think that the punch is just adequate the raspberry is great and I think too that raspberry on its own it's worth this package but nothing wrong with the punch really it's fine but I don't know that this is gonna be a go-to flavor of month of mine for nerds moving forward just overall I think that you can get more bang for your buck out of the whatever that peach there's like a peach wild berry mix I think I reviewed it on the channel a while ago can you overall there's still a very high quality product are you guys like nerds if you know the Nerds brand this is a good one to try I don't think it's gonna be your favorite certainly not for me but it's um but it's not bad yeah and um you know and like not bad for a nerd is still very very good being comparison to like most any other kind of candy so I have to give it a recommend but I'm not gonna give it as high recommend as I would an alternate skew of Wonka's nerds so walk in the candy aisle is gonna rate the surf-and-turf nerds raspberry tropical punch i am going to rage it's a 3 out of 5 it's good definitely for nerds fans it's one you're gonna want to have and want to try and you know not bad but doesn't blow me away anyway that's it for me for now thank you very much for watching if you would like to see more abuse please click the links that you see on the screen now and I will talk to you next time so long everyone bye bye", "jKNgX3zwk_A": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying some starburst drink mixes these are zero sugar which makes them terrific this is the all pink strawberry drink mix and the blue racer drink mix so these are the they call them singles to go a lot of times all refer to miss blenker packs just because and that's what anger caused them there are water enhancer that's a very pretty pink package these were a dollar each at Dollar General and hopefully watch the other review that we've done on the star bars we reviewed the fruit punch cherry and lemon and I don't remember what my verdict was about which one was my favorite in that video but I can tell you since then the lemon is just it's absolutely phenomenal I love it and for a dollar apiece you get six sticks they are five calories per stick so old how it does it so strawberry drink make strawberry almost was like oh it smells really good yeah it says now you can enjoy your favorite Starbucks flavors and a refreshing beverage with six sticks in each box you can hydrate with a quick and delicious drink in your car during work or wherever you go and I always keep a couple of these in my purse as well because we don't go out to eat very often but when we do go out to eat I don't like to pay three dollars for a coat because I'm cheap and so I will ask for a glass of ice water and I will add one of these flavor packs to the ice water and if there's nine from soon whatever on the table that's what I use and people have said well do they say anything that's the surface say anything or no I've never been asked any funny questions or anything because I can add anything you know I I want to add a flavor back to my water I can't and it's delicious so we're gonna try they all pay first I love the company I feel like we're having a baby shower here yeah we're having a gender-reveal party yeah you can do that take one of these and pour it into another little pouch maybe I you have put in a paper envelope or something and pour it in and shake it out if you can see the powder though that's bad thing I love the flavor hmm oh sorry it is it's very nice now you like that we've sent and we sent in the previous video you can put it in these bottles or you can pour it in a glass our glasses are almost as tall as this but they must not they're not quite as tall because I've tried to pour ball the ball of water in there nice and there's still a lot okay because we have regular tall clear glasses and Kevin put one of the other flavor packs in that water and he said it was almost really strong so really the amount of water 16 this is 16.9 ounces this is really the perfect size that's what they're made for yeah they're made for a bottle of water so if your glasses aren't quite that tall then you might not want to use all the powder it was way too strong so I ended up kind of drinking that it was it was very it was almost syrupy how strong it was and this is blue raspberry and it does have that blue that raspberry flavor you know what that'd be good in what pops oh that would be a very good pops up on yeah I agree you know these and what can you make absolutely good yeah if you had those trays that Union the Dollar Tree make your own popsicle you could totally for their wiper pack in there shake it up that's what people make now already yeah and pour it into those containers you could use these I've never thought about using these to make those popsicles yeah but you had walked it it probably would be nothing you can get a whole packet of kool-aid for 89 cents or some right and make all pitcher of cool right the bloom raspberry was good it's not one that I would want all the time which is fronts because you love I do love raspberry I agree with you that someone I'm going all the time but if you drank if you mix it in with your other ones flavors exactly exactly so you're not gonna yeah I wouldn't go through like a whole like that lemon I would do the whole box yeah you drinkin one outfit yes and it's like when I add these to water a Kevin agreed we drink them twice as quick your office is we do like the clear American water from Walmart because they're so sweet and they have so much flavor that I do drink a lot more of that I think that's offering faster than I drink water too right so water is just boring so but even the clear American I would rather have these than the clear American they're so delicious I love them so out of these my choice would be the straw okay yeah but they're both really good it's just the strawberry one I could drink every day every day what we talked about the raspberry I wouldn't want that every day I could drink it but I wouldn't want it every day no are these five pillars of yeah five calories apiece yeah so I don't think that's bad at all so hopefully I'm helping Walmart or get them we've looked at Walmart I looked at one Alexa to me yeah cinamon Walmart yet so we have only seen these in the Dollar General so if you've seen them in a different grocery store let people know where you saw them and because I would love for everybody to get to try these so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight

Mike Hansen and in\u00a0\nthis video we're talking about CBD what is CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the story behind cannabidiol the cannabis product\u00a0\nthat gets you well not high you've heard of CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the cannabis product whose popularity has reached\u00a0\nalmost crazed lake proportions CBD has come from\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere to everywhere in just the last few years\u00a0\nit is perhaps best known for its ability to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce anxiety and promote happiness but CBDs\u00a0\napplications are seemingly endless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 successfully used to help with pain insomnia and\u00a0\ndepression there are some reports that it helps\u00a0\u00a0 with other medical conditions as well because\u00a0\nof its wide range of uses CBD infused products\u00a0\u00a0 are the fastest growing segment of the health\u00a0\nindustry even some pets are getting in on the\u00a0\u00a0 action for example CBD troubles are used to calm\u00a0\ndogs Carl's jr. the fast food chain has created a\u00a0\u00a0 burger served with a CBD infused sauce not that\u00a0\nI endorse calls jr. or any fast food for that\u00a0\u00a0 matter and New York City CBD infused coffee was\u00a0\nall the rage and sell at the camp and then there\u00a0\u00a0 is medical celebrities dr. oz and dr. Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a lot coming down the pike and\u00a0\nif you want to know more about CBD or if you\u00a0\u00a0 have questions about it put it in the comments\u00a0\nbelow and make sure to give this video like

all in all um i don't think it is very nice if you want to give it a go then go and try it but i don't think it's very delicious it's got some kind of artificial taste to it yes all in all i don't think yazoo is very good you don't want to sing and shout about it you just want to give it a miss so all in all this is not a good one if you want to try a good milkshake get the mega donuts wow that is a good one this one not so good okay guys i hope you enjoyed the video as always if you like the video like the video subscribe i'm going to catch you on the oops daisy on the next one and as always", "WMwvIJ4BUgI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel for those of you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "z_Qj9j07M8I": "welcome to natural viagra survival oh the firmest so viagra is best on a drill the bullet time and it really is it really helps 100 million men worldwide so from erectile disfunction and there is solutions like a research paper earlier so the forty percent of men over the age of forty so far from erectile dysfunction mmm yeah so in terms of short-term benefits one food is fantastic first watermelon contains citrulline which is a compound which helps in the production of nitric oxide nitrogen oxide is what dilates our blood vessels and really improves blood flow to our members very important and so in terms of servings okay so what amount this is really simple this the short term gain so take a watermelon a quarter but is usually good so that if it what a typical watermelon you use you get about 16 slices a quarter Mountain is a serving which should give you more than enough citrulline for the day it's really oughta make blood flow and okay so as Dave mentioned this is a short-term play so this is to get it back working the long-term play I'm gonna get to that okay I'm gonna put in a little bit of lemon juice just to help kind of break it down and help the absorption just a little squeeze okay little drop more lemon beautiful just in a plane or a blender works great if you didn't have a blender you could simply put in a bowl and mash it boom yeah so simply blend until effects are liquid homemade viagra natural vigor this is really simple and accessible and as I said a quarter melon is a great serving of us over water whatever watermelon so so about four slices and look look here's another interesting so yellow watermelon has made four times the nectar citrulline it so instead of four slices you would only need one slice Oh so what amount of juice is the short term play it's great for a blood funnel to really help things moving in one study they found that it was a 68 percent increase in monthly sexual performance so that's great there was one study which we found earlier erectile dysfunction is actually the first sign of cardiovascular disease it's the canary in the coal mine because the artery don't go to your penis is half the size of the artery go into your heart so obviously as soon as that stops working it's the first indicator that you've got some form of heart disease so the long-term play is you want to cut in if you're smoked you want to recut stop smoking or cut it down you want to reduce your alcohol consumption you want to eat more fruit and veg and go on a mission full of fiber next thing is reduced big your assumption refined food reduce your consumption animal food reduce your saturated fat intake and in essence eat more veg because obviously we all know penises to work as long as we can you know as long as we live and the long-term game is really is it's a lifestyle kind of think short term play watermelon juice fantastic really is and viagra as people know out there it's a best selling drug for a reason it works but it doesn't improve your libido whereas adopting a healthier lifestyle Rhian curtain proves your libido and improves your performance and it will improve blood flow and blood flow is key to everything so okay let's wrap this up by saying in ode to rock-hard cucumbers yes and Virginia when you leave a comment let us know how you get on with this and citrulline will really help us we said watermelon juice accessible you should get watermelon most the Year rain in most super mario some sexual healing boom", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m.

of these CBD videos that get put out there and people are paid so they're more influenced to say certain things to make the product seem a little bit more promising than what it may be so just want to

seen a ton of this on social media I'm sure of it everybody proclaiming that it is the number one care to literally everything under the Sun from anxiety to inflammation joint pain migraines anything can be cured with a few drops of CBD oil but is this actually the truth a company called herb strong and I'm sure you've heard of them before they contacted me about four or five weeks ago asking me if I'd like to try out one of their products for free and me being the curious person that I am I just wanted to see what the hype was all about and I did my research on it so that I wouldn't get tested positive in a drug test which I will touch on later so they decided to send me their $65 bottle of 1000 milligram full-spectrum hemp oil and if you want to see how I reacted to it what my thoughts are on it then you can just go to this time stamp right here but first I think we have to talk about what CBD actually is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol is actually one of over 100 different chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are exclusive to the cannabis plant now the really cool thing about the human body is that we actually have a couple of receptors known as cb1 and cb2 that are cannabinoid receptors now the cb1 receptors are responsible for psychoactive effects so when you consume something that has a strong affinity for this receptor and makes it active such as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC you're going to experience things that come with being high impaired movement impaired vision you might forget a few things anything comes up being high it's because of the cb1 receptors being active now the cv 2 receptors are actually found in the immune system and these are meant to actually help the human body which is why you see these CBD oil companies proclaiming that they're going to help things like anxiety migraines inflammation joint pain that's because CBD actually has a strong affinity for the cb2 receptors and when active they're supposedly supposed to help with all these things now is this stuff legal to purchase yes and no it really does all depend because boom people hear the word cannabis they instantly freak out it is 100% legal I'm going to stay away from it with a 50-foot pole however it really all depends from a technical standpoint as long as somebody contains 0.3% or less THC then it is perfectly legal to purchase however anything over that threshold is obviously illegal that's why you see things such as hemp powder being sold in grocery stores because it really doesn't contain any THC now this does not mean that it's not going to show up on a drug test like I did say before 0.3% or less if it contains 0.2% if there's a chance that it's going to show up on a drug test so just make sure you are doing a research before purchasing anything CBD related now the company herb strong they did send me some product and I like I said before I did my research before even saying yes to the free products just to make sure that it didn't contain any THC and I took a look at their lab report and I took a look at the left hand bottom of the report and it said that it did not contain any detectable amounts of THC so as I said before if you plan on purchasing something just make sure that you do some research on whatever company it is and make sure that there's no detectable THC in their products because this is a powered looking Channel and I do compete in the USA PL which is an IPF affiliate let's talk about wada for a second or the world anti-doping agency let me take a look at their banned substances list and you're going to see that cannabinoids are actually on their banned list however they do make an exception for cannabidiol which as I did mention before is CBD but as I did mention if your product that you are consuming does contain traceable amounts of THC then you are going to test positive for drugs in your system so as I keep harping on make sure you do your research on any of these products that are CBD related now that we have all that sciency stuff out of the way let's talk about my experience with CBD oil now again I do compete and tested Federation didn't want to take anything that would end up biting me in the ass for lack of better terms which is why I gave the okay to Armstrong to send me out some of their stuff because from what they said it doesn't contain any traceable amounts of THC now I don't suffer from anxiety or migraines multiple sclerosis anything of that nature all I really do suffer from is some joint pains and some inflammation maybe my sleep quality could have improved a little bit but really nothing on the mental health side of things more so just actual physical pains that I do suffer from so I was hoping by taking this product it would help out with those pains a little bit so I followed the instructions for about a week five drops underneath the tongue both in the morning and at night so it's ten drops a day on an empty stomach and after the first week really didn't experience anything at all took a little bit the email one more time and said to give it a couple of weeks so I gave it another seven days same thing five drops in the morning and at night ten drops a day 140 drops over a span of two weeks and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit my joint pains were still there inflammation was still there nothing had really gone away now I was giving it one more week but I actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's sixteen drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which what I was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that I did experience so I am a little bit disappointed with that so this really isn't a product that I'm going to be using in the future I actually ended up giving the remaining of the remainder of the bottle to someone at work that does suffer from anxiety and hopefully it does help them out a little bit more than I did help me but I just want I just wanted to put out this video to spread a little bit of truth when it does come to the use of these products just make sure that you are doing your research on all this stuff because you really don't want to be wasting $6,500 on something that's potentially not going to work now going back to the whole sleep quality thing can I take this to improve my sleep quality sure am I going to know because I think there's better ways to improve overall sleep quality such as getting some blackout curtains to make sure that it's pitch-black in your room regulating your room temperature so you're always sleeping in the same temperature every single night and just getting more hours of sleep if you like you could improve your sleep quality for a set price of maybe like fifty bucks instead of always spending sixty five dollars a month which can really add up over time and end up being a waste of money if you could do it in a much cheaper fashion so yeah that was pretty much my experience with CBD maybe it just didn't work out for me I'm not sure but I really don't see myself using this product in the future and just be weary of other people that are saying that it's curing everything that is wrong with them because I for one didn't experiences I did a post on Reddit and other people were saying that they experienced pretty much the same thing that I did with CBD oil where their inflammation and joint pain really didn't go away there were some people that did say that it did help out with our migraines but again I don't suffer from those so I can't really speak on those so to say so yeah that's my experience with CBD oil hope you don't hate me for it if you did enjoy the video or you just feel it does deserve one please be sure to drop in to thumbs up because it helped does help to channel out a lot more than you do think if you want to see any more of my videos and please be sure to sub to the channel and hopefully I'll see you with that next one [Music]", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "dEBwlj6KCDM": "so I'm always looking for more ways to get collagen into my diet every day and what a great way to accomplish that is through just simple gummies on this episode I'm gonna show you how easy it is to make some delicious blueberry gummies whoa [Music] [Music] okay so blueberry gummies this is going to be so ridiculously easy and simple then it's almost gonna shock you blink we're gonna be done but anyway what we're going to be using is Lakewood pure blueberry organic no added sugar just straight blueberry juice this is my favorite supplier of beef gelatin this is by with proteins what we're gonna do is I'm gonna pour one cup just one cup okay shake it up just a little bit one cup okay to 6 tablespoons of beef gentlemen now what's so important why is beef gelatin so healthy this is predominantly collagen and you're gonna start seeing a theme that I try to get collagen in my diet is often as possible why because it's the most abundant protein in the human body and we're talking about the memory that's being responsible for skin hair nails all the connective tissues with carla tendons ligaments at collagen so as I poured this in here I'm gonna stir this up okay I don't know if you can get in there and see that it's starting to come Joe already and that's okay that's when we tell her what you happen then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let this sit for three minutes so and three minutes I'll be back it has been three minutes so as you can see what it does is kind of look solid right but you still see it's kind of grainy in there so what we're gonna do is we're now gonna keep this stuff okay let me get this going medium to high heat we're gonna do this until it actually starts to melt and it gets hot we don't really want to boil but we want to do we do want to get this hot so add this sitting here and it loosens up a little bit and starts to melt I'm gonna start stirring this stuff to get it ready to actually put it inside the mold so you know the cool thing about this not only is it super nutritious but this is a project that you can actually involve the whole family especially kids this is actually kind of fun so well we later on go into where I'm actually putting the concoction inside the mold you'll see that where you know some kids will actually probably enjoy this and then we'll do the taste test to reveal all that good stuff and these things are actually phenomenal um you don't have to just use blueberry juice you literally can use them with any type of juice you want I've made all kinds of gummies before and some later episodes i'ma be doing some very very cool gummies probably gummies that you've never really combination never even thought about but like for instance a good combination with collagen so remember the most important ingredient in the beef gelatin is collagen vitamin C and collagen go together very well so you can make a gummy that involves you know a good organic orange juice and gelatin those are a phenomenal gummy but this is all about blueberries today so now it's starting to loosen up a little bit so I'm gonna start stirring it and if you can get in here you can kind of see it's melting right so I'm gonna completely melt this start to stir it and like I said we don't want to boil we just want to get nice and hot okay and now it's completely melted okay see some smoke coarse obscene coming out of there so that lets me know it's pretty warm etat I'm gonna give it just another 30 seconds of salt that's good all right now the next part the final part almost upon the part the final part would be a kneading action but the second-to-last part is gonna be actually getting this bad boy into the mold so I will see you in two point two seconds again now it's the fun part the wriggle fun part so I got my son he's back again this is Tristan if you missed the first episode and then the second episode so now we're gonna do is when you decide drop it right here okay word of advice for whatever reason don't turn these up after you pull up the actual solution because if you do for some reason they projectile explode all over the place Flynn at the hard way a couple times right so what I'm doing right now is gonna suck this up alright come on over and we're just gonna start filming off each one of these so even some of the younger kids I think would actually enjoy this after the process of making some good fantastic snacks and then even educate them along the way collagen is very very very important for kids because they're constantly growing and like I mentioned earlier collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body a good way to keep your skin healthy your nails healthy your hair healthy your joints healthy is with collagen in your diet every day I can't stress that enough having 400 all right and now what we're gonna do is put these bad boys in refrigerator takes about 60 minutes for these babbling stick and gel and then I will see you on the other side the taste test and see if these things actually are delicious be back shortly so it's been approximately 60 minutes I just pulled these bad boys out of refrigerator son are you ready yeah you ready yeah you ready yeah all right so what you do is grab the tray and then it's real simple all you do is just pop these out okay oh isn't that cute thank you all right but now do they taste cute Cheers no scared me for a minute man all right so a delicious way to get collagen in every day if you really want to you can't let your own companies um the next thing that I want to talk about like I don't have any sugar to this okay so and I usually don't add sugar too many things but if you wanted it to sweeten it up a little bit get some organic turbinado sugar organic cane sugar even use honey if you want to just a little bit sweeter but if your being conscious about losing fat losing weight you might not want to add that for sugar these taste fantastic just the way they are but anyway so let's recap this final proteins beef gelatin you can take your favorite juice I actually use to feel good live good you know some Lakewood pure blueberry organic juice like I said if you want to get a little extra bump in vitamin C vitamin C and collagen work synergistically together you can use orange juice in collagen it's very simple use about one cup of juice to about six tablespoons and voila you know all within about an hour and what probably ten minutes of prep time you have delicious snacks that the even the kids can enjoy these are young men and young women growing up they need more healthy options and collagen remember is the most abundant protein in the human body so we need this new connective tissue suitable skin you see what does for my hair you know me alright so like always help me help you and let's just get healthier one day at a time", "IPK8GTttsGA": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some cake bombs these were bought at critchfield meats so uh the title of the video will probably be like critchfield meat cake bombs because we bought those in a bottom in clear plastic packages there's no information on them um at all it just says safe handling instructions and keep them refrigerated or frozen that type of thing no calories no nothing on them so we're guessing they're just their bakery their bakery the crutchfield meat bakery so like i said they're called cake bombs i have the chocolate truffle and the strawberry and i have the key lob cake yes and so this is um i told kevin i said this is like trying um like a local place like we've done donut shops and stuff like that because uh really i don't have any information to give you other than they were 4.99 apiece 15 yes let's see what it looks like so um 15 here for the three soft so i'm wondering if it's just like a regular chocolate cake and they just no it's got like a movie no that's literally truffle so it said truffle oh my goodness i'm not just that's as far as i can go with it i don't want to go any further but that that's what it looks like it's got like a truffley kind of pudding like top on the top oh wow so we definitely want to try that so let's just turn that over like that yeah so we can see what we're getting here make sure we get it it's got like cake on the bottom yes so the chocolate cake i'm assuming it's just chocolate cake look at it has these little um crispy pieces of chocolate cake is not bad it doesn't taste like chop uh truffle it tastes like pudding yeah it's more like a devil's food kind of flavor a devil's food cake i don't know what the cat wants up here it um that's good though if you like more of a devil's food kind of cake i think you would like that i do too i like it a lot i think there's not anything bad about it but i wouldn't expect uh the richness of a truffle really it is a pudding okay so let's cut this one so i'll try to get a picture uh for you all up here inside of that yeah let's go and check that so that you can see the insides of them so i don't know the same thing if crutchfield meet is one of those that's a locally owned place i don't know if it's a chain i don't know oh okay so this just says strawberry cake balm yeah we'll just cut go ahead go for it i like the color of it so it's a vanilla cake on the bottom oh well all right oh okay like a savage that one's sweeter than the chocolate one i love the cake it's very very good the strawberry is very good that's good the cake's a little dry it has been on both of them but but it's still got a good flavor honestly that cake reminds me like a bakery cake i think that is very that to me it doesn't taste like your typical box cake mix it um your mind that's very nice you know the little strawberry um cake little cakes yes it reminds me that they've taken one of those and put up like a scoop of of a pudding on like on top of it and then dunked it or whatever they mira glazed it or whatever on top that's what it kind of reminds me it's nice it's very good strawberry it is very nice yeah it's a fresher strawberry flavor now this is let's take this one out key lime uh looks like they it has coconut coconut around the edge of the outside very soft now this cake fills moisture yeah where it might be i don't know if you can pick this one up it's a little wet i like to try the cake by itself first that's a really nice um limiting high flavor lemon lime kind of flavor it's very very good i like that one the best it's in the cake by the way is the first two i thought was a little drop this one's not at all no no no it um it's very zesty just like a a good key lime would be and the coconut to me the coconut on the outside is everything that's textured i have never in my life had a cake with coconut on it until kevin and i got married and his mother made one for easter she had this bunny cut out and so it's just a regular cake but she put a coconut shavings white frosting and coconut oh listen it was the best thing i've ever just put in that you wouldn't believe the difference that makes just to put that coconut on the outside it makes any regular cake incredible doing that and i like that one too quite a bit that's my favorite um after the three um yes i'm gonna pick the key lime as well for my favorite and then i would go for the strawberry yeah and the chocolate's good it's just a little darker than what i would choose to eat the chocolate for me was delicious but i was expecting truffle and not pudding and it truly does taste like pudding it just doesn't have the the thickness of a truffle or the richness of flavor of truffle it's just like chocolate pudding uh so yes these are all yes very good you could absolutely buy one of these for five dollars and split it between the two of you and so it could or have it one night half of it and then the next night have half of it so i hope you enjoyed the video let us know if you have critchfield meet in your area and thanks for watching [Music] so", "VGyrCvYyxUc": "hey everyone caffeine man here and today we are going to be trying out the brand new addition to the bang line and that is the delish strawberry kiss not only that but we're also going to be doing the strawberry blast to compare the two to see how similar they are coming right up [Music] hello again everyone thank you so much for joining me today if you'd like to stay informed on all things caffeine related feel free to hit the subscribe button i post new videos every tuesday night with a bonus video on the weekends and if you'd like to show more support for the channel i do have a patreon where you can join up for as little as one dollar link will be in the description box down below and in today's video we're going over the newest elise by bang and this is their valentine edition that valentine's that's coming up i better get to the store can't have what happened last year and being a valentine's day inspired flavor they got hearts on the can and it's called delish strawberry kiss now there have been a lot of people that have been saying oh it tastes just like the strawberry blast but i've come to realize that people that make these comments are usually just making them to make it sound like they know what they're talking about or they just like to hear themselves talk and i don't mean any offense to anybody everyone absolutely has a right to their opinion but just right off the bat without even drinking them yet i can tell you that they're gonna be different a company as large as bang isn't gonna take the same exact drink from one package it in another can and call it something new or at least i don't think they would they wouldn't do that but we will find out because maybe that's what they want me to think it could be tricky like that i'm going with my gut and i'm saying they're not going to taste alike and we will be tasting them side by side so i can be the one to tell you exactly if they taste alike and listen they're both strawberry flavors so i can see why people are saying they're probably going to taste similar but it's not going to be the same exact thing because some people were saying the purple kittles was a military exclusive and then they released radical skedaddle and people were theorizing that they were the same flavor but because people couldn't get the military one unless they were military they released the radical skedaddle and listen they did taste a little bit similar but they were definitely different and i know people that when they reviewed them they reviewed the purple kittles when it came out and then several months later reviewed the radical skedaddle and said all those two are the same until they did a video where they drank both of them side by side i said oh yeah they're definitely different so i think these two strawberries are going to be similar but they'll be different when you drink them next to each other so there's only one thing to do let's taste them out i just need to grab it from my campus protein fridge and campus protein does indeed sell bang we've actually got some really great prices and on top of those really great prices you can save 10 off your order using coupon code caffeine man 10 they even have variety packs that they sell so if you haven't tried it you can try a bunch of different ones out as of the making of this video they don't have the delish strawberry kiss yet but they usually get it within a few weeks of it being released so be sure to check campus protein to see if they have it and if you haven't checked them out yet check them out for all the other pre-workout drinks they have too they usually have a lot of deals on the drinks you may drink you can save 10 off your entire order using coupon code caffeine man 10. and here is the can they went with a nice pink and red type can it's got some little hearts on there too for the background so they definitely go on valentine's and who knows maybe they'll sell some more for the guys buying it for their girlfriends or girlfriends buying it for their boyfriends who knows let's just taste it out [Music] clear color all right all right it's definitely different from what i was expecting i was really hoping for a much stronger strawberry flavor in some of my other reviews when i did some strawberries i always said that there really isn't that many good strawberries out there although i did find one the amino strawberry i really liked it was one of the candy strawberries it was a really sweet strawberry most of the other strawberries have been like strawberry kiwi or strawberry mixed with something else and they weren't overly strong so let me go over it the carbonation is a medium to medium high carbonation they usually have high carbonation but it seems like they toned it down maybe a touch for this one it's a reminding me of what they did with the key lime pie i believe out of all the bags that i've had the key lime pie had just a little bit less carbonation because they were going for more of a dessert feel and they've gone with a little bit less carbonation on this one as well the sweetness is a it's a high sweetness they're definitely giving you a sweet drink here it was probably on the low end of the high but still you're definitely getting a good sweetness out of here and for the flavor profile i'm also going to give it a medium to high flavor profile closing at a high because they are definitely giving you a lot of flavor there hasn't been a drink yet where they haven't given you a really close to high or high flavor except maybe miami cola but out of all the drinks that they had they usually go strong in flavor strong in sweetness and you got that with this one here and i would say that this strawberry is actually sort of medium in flavor so it's giving you a little bit more flavor than most of the other ones it definitely has something creamy in there i can't tell if it's vanilla it's sort of a milky it's sort of it's just sort of creamy so you're getting more of a strawberry cream out of it and i don't really want to say you're getting a strawberry shortcake because you're not getting like that bread you're sort of getting like a strawberry and cool whip whip whip whip cool whip or not even cool with maybe whipped cream but whatever the case you're getting strawberry plus a little bit of creaminess and actually it's reminding me even though i just mentioned the key lime pie it's reminding me what they did with the key lime pie they went a little bit lighter with the flavor didn't give you that super high flavor profile they went like a medium medium high flavor profile and then they gave you just like a touch of creaminess and a touch of like graham cracker feel to it to really make it taste like key lime pie and i think they're really going for a dessert beverage with this one as well i just can't tell what it is actually even a touch of maybe um of the rainbow unicorn too just a reminiscent of that but yeah and i'd like to try and get more i always try to get as accurate as possible um it is reminding me of something and i'm trying to be like yeah it's strawberry cream and i think that's the best way to describe oh oh i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it oh i'm happy when i get it it's like that hard candy i wish i could remember the candy i can't it's on the tip of my tongue it's it's not worthless where this is just butterscotch i think um but it's a little it's a round candy that's a red and white it's like a little swirls in it it's really nice looking and what is the name of that do you know the candy that you don't know um this is gonna kill me uh i can't spend too much time thinking about it now so editing guy make sure you put a picture up there for everybody i don't care if you don't have a computer that works right it's going to take an hour to find a picture another hour i'll probably put it in the program but that's what we do we get the information to the people working on a really slow laptop while my computer's being fixed it looks like it's going to be another week or so guys so you'll be getting some shorter bonus videos it's a host of the longer videos but yeah it tastes like that candy right there that i definitely put a picture up for you guys i hope you like the picture that candy melted down put into a can now before we put it on the caffeine man rating chart we're gonna go ahead we're gonna taste out that strawberry blast next but first i've gotta get some crackers to make sure i get that creaminess out of my mouth so we can accurately taste test the strawberry blast i should get a goldfish sponsorship i think all the times i mentioned them strawberry blast [Music] do the sniff test oh that doesn't smell creamy at all it's light and strawberry it's got that blast smell to it too and that's not a joke some of people think oh he has a straight face with some of those jokes but they got the star blast and if you smell the star blast it smells a little bit like this i wonder if they're using the strawberry from the star blast because the star blast is red white and blue that red could be strawberry stasted out again because i already did a review on this if you guys didn't see my review on this i did this and the purple kills i'll put a picture of it there probably take me a half hour in editing but i will so go check out that video 100 different i don't even have to go back in to that one to know that this is different so anyone who leaves a comment saying it's exactly the same you got to get your taste buds checked because they're way off even if your taste buds are off these are definitely definitely different i'm going to go back in just a 1 000 triple check confirm it but definitely creamy definitely a strawberry cream definitely a light flavor of strawberry a little bit of blast and there you go for all you were wondering if these two strawberries were the same they are not so where is this going to be going on the caffeine man rating chart already rated the strawberry blast before taking a look at the caffeine man rating chart or as i should say the the um the makeshift caffeine man rating chart that computer need that computer back i think they did a good job making a unique flavor there's not really too much out there like this some people might say well it's similar to the whipped strawberry by rockstar which you know the whipped strawberry does have sort of a strawberry cream flavor but it tastes like crap whereas this bang strawberry creamish kind of flavor or i should call it the delish strawberry kiss but that's a really long name to say it's definitely a good dessert flavor and i like the uniqueness of it but for me personally it's not really something i would drink being a strawberry drink i'd like to have a much more solid stronger strawberry flavor so i'm fairly confident that my score is going to be a little bit lower than some of the other people that are going to like this creamy dessert drink but if you're not into creamy drinks you're probably not going to like it as much therefore on the caffeine man rating chart i'm going to give this an 8.6 still definitely a solid score close to nine but a little bit low for a bang product because i think that the bang products definitely do have a lot more solid flavors than this one but once again i'm pretty sure that 8.6 isn't going to be an agreement to a lot of people i still think there's going to be a lot of people that buy this and i definitely think it's going to be sticking around thank you so much for joining me today i hope i gave you some great information in comparing the strawberry blast and the deli strawberry kiss i hope i gave you an accurate representation of what it tastes like i am going to be attempting to get you guys another bonus video this week if you didn't know from my previous posts or previous video you probably heard me mention that my computer's broken in this video i am using an old laptop so things are taking me a lot longer to do but i am trying to get you guys content because there's a lot of new drinks coming out and i want to make sure i get you these reviews i really have a big month of january january january january is over but i do have a good strong solid end of january and beginning of february coming up with tons of new drinks and actually rather than list them all now i'm just going to put them on the screen because i'm going to close out this video so until next time have yourselves a great day or night i just need to grab her from my campus protein of the rainbow unicorn too just a reminiscent of that you know i had to get a reminiscent in there somewhere love that word you", "SpIVTibLzMQ": "today Kevin and I are going to try two new kinds of juicy fruit gum they are both a combination of juicy fruit and starbursts so that's pretty cool well we found these in the Dollar Tree and they were a dollar each we have the cherry and we have the strawberry so what we'll do is we'll take it out of the package and which one do you want to try first strawberry strawberry okay get the strawberry and we'll tell you how it smells try to get the side off my face these are five pairs each five calories each the Suns in your face to be in there or 15 sticks in the package so that's pretty good for a dollar first roll Oh for good soft mm-hmm well that is a really good firearm I like that a lot it's a very strong strawberry flavor good bad softer though but it reminds you of survivors tasters like a-starboard yeah so it is 241 now and we'll see how long this lasts and then tell you how long we were actually able to chew it comfortably okay it is 1:00 1:15 it is 3:15 and Kevin just spit his gum out and I'm going to it was very good gum I don't know that it's something that I would get all the time that flavor but but it was good I don't remember what time I put it in because we've been out of the car but it was very good are you ready for another piece now are you gonna wait I'm gonna give our jaw rest and then we're gonna try the cherry next okay so the last gum that we have to try is the juicy fruit starburst in the cherry and they have these available everywhere these gums now so it's not like I'm showing you anything that you can't find but Kevin can you get the open no Gavin oh it smells good very very strong flavor support on sorry I had nothing to do was a gun review but he is wearing shorts in 30 degrees on something that is very strong cherry it does it takes just like the star harsh so they did recreate the flavor right what and there didn't softy they have Linden starburst says lemon and do they have one I'm trying to think of the other flavors that come in a package and would I would think of these go overwhelmed that they would come out with those flavors as well these are really really good so it is now four o'clock we'll see how long this scam was okay it is about quarter after 4:00 so this second piece lasted about 15 minutes so that means we tried the strawberry and the cherry Kevin which one did you like the best turn the cherry Kevin like to show you this um I don't know which one I like the best I probably wouldn't buy either kind again they were good but I just I probably wouldn't buy either one again just because I've said in other videos I like the Trident layers more but but they are really good so if you see them you should get them especially if you like starbursts I love starbursts so if I had to pick between one I would probably get the strawberry though because it was stronger the flavor to me was a stronger flavor than the cherry what did you think about so I'm going for the strongest flavor so I would pick strawberry Kevin would go for cherry so but they're both good $1 not bad for 15 sticks that's 15 times you can chew after about 15 minutes your jaw will start hurting though but I think that is typical of any of this kind of gum so hope you enjoyed this hope you enjoyed getting to ride around with us a little bit and while we chew gum so thanks for watching", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell

enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way

"GMZn_PRxCXo": "hey welcome back to no hype beer reviews unless it's your first time then welcome please consider subscribing if you do hit the notification bell gilly updates really excited for today's video the beers courtesy of steven thank you so much steven i really appreciate it and it's definitely a different beer for me um with some similar or some not similarities some things that are familiar i guess familiarities uh isn't what i was looking for uh if you are not aware i'm doing a theme week where all the beers i'm drinking this week have three or more adjuncts and this one is no exception it's from phantom brewing i had a brown nail from them uh which was good it was very much a brown nail you know like and that's a good thing when you're brewing a style it's okay to deliver that style so i'm excited to try a second one this one's a little bit more outside the box uh it's called do it for the gram it's a sour ipa with blueberry peach and graham cracker 5.7 percent abv yeah let's get into it cool canar it's like a grim reaper kind of character taking a selfie i don't know if the camera will pick up on that or not but uh yeah it's pretty cool so this is i was nervous because i just had a beer i was going to review explode everywhere so i was like man i hope this one doesn't also so that wasn't too much of an explosion these sour fruited beers are sometimes sometimes they can explode beautiful color oh ocd okay so blueberry peach and graham cracker 5.7 percent abv phantom brewing from uh courtesy of steven all right so pretty clean glassware yeah i mean it looks like it has you know berries mashed up somewhere in there i mean yeah blueberries from you know making smoothies or whatever like you do blend them up they have you know this kind of color but you know it's funny like you think of what blueberries look like that's not it but yeah when you blend them up you get a little bit more of that reddish pink color in there you know in terms of like peach or graham cracker what you know how that would affect the color i don't think too much especially when it's combating blueberry just under a finger i had probably had a finger before i started talking uh it does have it's like white with some nice pink notes to it uh it is going away relatively quickly which given the adjuncts i'm not super surprised um almost like watermelon pureed you know pureed up but anyway it looks good it's gonna say aroma it's not huge um i am getting a little bit of a berry thing you could tell me uh blueberry or actually interestingly strawberry and i would believe you i'm getting a hair more sour slash tartness if my camera's moving it's because the cat is using a tripod to rub its face again against the legs yeah yeah howl is that a good idea there is a multi thing i i'll say graham crackers because it has graham crackers in it but like it might just be the the malt base but maybe it is a graham cracker there is some sweetness too actually it is very crackery that way there is some sweetness yeah let's pretend that it definitely is a graham cracker and i would have picked up on that on my own if this was a mystery beer but yeah it might just be because of some of the fruited sours i've had of late it's not bursting with any sweetness or i'm sorry like like huge fruity sweetness then like the tartness sourness it's just it's not as impactful of an aroma it is oh and again this is a sour ipa so it is not the same style it's not a puree style or whatever howell do we really want to be doing that i'm not going to throw it at him let's get taste cheers i like to taste better than the aroma and if i had to pick which one to be better maybe i do have ocd i'm definitely feeling like this is dirty it's kind of bothering me um and the cat rubbing it on a tripod it's face like tripod i mean it's really this might be the the most stressed i've ever been doing maybe oops he just did it play with that yeah bat it around got that around said the camera kind of worked anyway this is where i should edit videos um yeah the taste is better than the aroma um it's not i don't know like a sour iph like what ipa qualities should i still be tasting in this you know is it just oh you know it has more hops than you would do like a more traditional sour ale i don't know yeah i mean you get some of that berry kind of like the aroma you could tell me blueberry or strawberry but because of the tartness in the taste you can also tell me something like a raspberry i believe you i didn't get peach until the taste so i do get a nice peach element it's funny because i've been using peach as a descriptor a lot in ipa especially ipas with citra as of late and this is unmistakably like that's pretty peachy like i think what the citra can kick out is pretty darn close to the real thing but it is interesting having a bit actually has peaches in it and um this is unmistakably a peachy thing but it's like 90 peach and then 10 apricot so it does kind of it's probably just the beer and the other flavors in the beer messing with me but like there is this little bit of an apricot thing but it is peacham in it it's not overly sour or tart it's someone who doesn't love it if it's too sour you know this this is definitely not approaching too sour for me um you know this is good you know if i was at a place and this was part of my flight i would be happy with the four ounces or whatever and then move on to the next beer um i'll gladly drink this whole beer but it's not it's not blowing my mind not that every bear has to blow your mind i mean get it it's a good beer it's good um it's not great it's not very good it's not really good it's just this is a good beer it's better than fine you know it's better than bad it's a good beer they did a good job with it and yeah that's all i have to say about it thanks again steve for sending i really appreciate it thank you guys for watching really appreciate that check them out instagram and untapped it's no hype your views at both of those places please please like comment subscribe and most importantly in bye cheers everyone", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud

are doing another taste test video with cloud nerds this is scraped strawberry strawberry grape grape something open it fill it vape it thanks for the instructions cloud nerds would have never known so strawberry grape i'm guessing it's gonna be strawberry and grape uh let's see if that's what this tastes like definitely tastes like really sugary very very sweet like if you are into like high intensity um like like the power of just like nerds like nerds candy then this will be the one for you it has a really strong um strawberry flavor the grape is a little bit on the subtle side but um overall the flavors do really go well together it's kind of like a pixie stick kind of like nerds it's very very candified so if that's what you're into then you're going to be very pleased with this one hmm would this be a great all day vape i don't know i can already kind of feel like i'm getting a little dehydrated um just because it's so sweet but uh i could definitely see this if you're like a salt nick user if you get this in a salt and put it in a little portable device and take it with you on the go then i think that's the perfect way to experience this because a full tank of this will probably wear you out a little bit it's very intense very in your face so yeah i would recommend it for lighter usage um on the go type stuff or just you know the one that you keep you like in your purse or your car you know one of those things for like your backup i don't know if it would be like my go-to every day unless you're super into like a lot of sugary sweetness and i know a lot of people out there are i used to be more on the extreme sweet side but now i'm finding myself just like have little hints of um sweetness added to certain flavors um yeah yeah i'm more into like fruits and stuff less into the candies these days but if some of you are like fully in the candy zone whatever you want to call it um definitely worth picking this one up cloud nerds grape strawberry i'm gonna give you a seven because you do taste good but you taste almost a little too good and that scares me so you can pick up a little bottle of grape strawberry from cloud nerds on eightvape.com

keep you safe from all the bandits welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I get a lot of questions about people asking for tips for determining if an edible is potent as advertised so today guys I'm gonna share with you five common sense tips on how to avoid getting scammed when it comes to buying edibles getting scammed at the dispensary is pretty easy it's a nascent market with little to no regulations and zero accountability there's also lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of money to be made so lots of money and no accountability equals sleazy scores for scammers and fraudsters and it's bad enough when dispensaries and growers mislead their customers on what strain or how potent the flower they are buying is but at least the customers can see the product they can verify its weight they can smell it or whatever other rituals they have to test their weed sure they may not be getting the premium product that they are supposedly paying for but if they're buying an amount they will generally get that amount edibles however are much easier to scan customers with a customer can't verify that 200 milligrams or whatever listed on the package is really 200 milligrams they don't see the edibles getting made they can't see it being packaged if you want to buy a product you've got to take the company at its word that their product is potent is advertised store that your dispensary isn't gonna sell you a shitty product and good luck with that so I don't want to scare anyone away from edibles because they're [ __ ] awesome there are tons of great and reliable edible companies out there and more certain to come soon and experimenting and trying new products is half the fun but before you go and buy something expensive you've never seen before try utilizing these five tips to save yourself some money and some heartache so tip number one don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for their recommendation both these places especially weed maps is swamped with a bunch of bots and fake reviews that amp up a lot of really shady companies like lol edibles or infused creations all those have been pumped up by their respective companies and they mislead you and also speaking of people that mislead you your bud tender may very well mislead you they may have some kind of sales contract or sales target for some specific edible or they may have some kind of relationship with an edible manufacturer and they may be just be trying to sell you something that is not very good I've certainly seen it happen many times I've seen a lot of bud tenders Hocking lol edibles saying it's you know the second coming do not be fooled by them do your own research ahead of time don't trust weed Maps don't trust your bud tender know what you're looking for add of time so tip number two is in this case you want to judge a book by its cover or you want to stick to those reputable brands and what I mean by judge a book by its cover is looked at like the packaging is the packaging nice is the packaging fancy does it really show off the edible and all its glory I'm just talking about canna Co I'm talking about Korova here these guys have great packaging vibrant packaging that really shows off and sells their product and generally speaking the fancier the packaging the nice of the packaging the nicer the product maybe because they have the money already from being a bigger brand to invest in their packaging you know I'm sure it's the dog wagging some tail here a little bit as to what comes first but really take a look at the packaging do not buy anything that's just in like a plastic ziplock bag with a sticker over it it's usually going to be a bad product you want to take a look and make sure it has respectable packaging faziz that's usually a pretty good indicator that it's going to be a decent product so again judge a book by its cover and stick to those reputable brands stick to the big-name guys out there the big-name guys are big names for a reason again that's gonna be your Korova that's gonna be your Kiva that's gonna be your Kanaka that's gonna be your flourish the big guys are big again for a reason and they all have nice packaging so again look for the fancy packaging stay away from crappy packaging it's usually a pretty good indicator that what's inside is just as what's it's just as crappy as what's on the outside so tip number three is baked goods are good and chocolate is the best so I'm gonna go ahead and combine this with don't be a dummy stay away from gummies that is mostly true almost all gummies are bad with a few very notable exceptions like flourish do not get infused creations do not get at up here you're gonna see a ton of prepackaged edible or gummy edibles out there and they are almost always terrible with again a very few exceptions when it comes to gummies if you see flourish go and pick them up but outside of that stay away from the gummies there are usually a little bit cheaper than other things usually sometimes even substantially more so but that's for a reason because they are not as potent as advertised so stick away from the gummies State stay close to the baked goods your cookies and your brownies not even the Krispies like the rice krispies treats the fruity Krispies i'd stay away from those as well I don't find those to be as potent your brownies and your cookies are your best bets but for the absolute best bet go with the chocolate bars that is the best way I have found on all of my reviews for getting THC and the most potent gram for gram has always been chocolate bars kiva bang for twenty two phones say all those great ones there's so many out there and it's usually if you can find a chocolate bar it's gonna be a fun fun ride so again tip number three baked goods are good chocolate is the best stay away from gummies alright so that brings us to tip number four and that is to look for independent lab testing results this is a big one if you can find on you package or somewhere actual lab testing results that is he and don't just look for them to say lab tested look for the actual results you'll see tons of edibles out there lying about being lab tested and then this that and the other but if they don't have that actual result printed on the package it's no good plenty of people will lie about being lab tested or they'll get one product lab tested and say their entire line is lab tested if you don't see the actual results it's wasn't lab tested just go with that so look for that lab tested results look for independent verified results printed on the package or if not printed on the package printed it on a sheep close by something that will let you know that is as potent as advertised so again if you can find those lab tested results and it comes up as potent as advertised go and pick up that product it's gonna be good to go and then finally our fifth tip here is the most important one and the one that I cannot stress enough and that is you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles if there is a deal that seems too good to be true if you see a 500 milligram rice krispies treat for ten dollars don't go running for your wallet to pick it up and buy up the entire stock because they're lying to you it's not gonna be 500 milligrams it's probably not even gonna be twenty milligrams it's probably just gonna be an operation to fleece you out of your money if something seems very expensive there's usually a reason for that if it seems out of line it's probably because it is high quality stuff made with quality cannabis and quality ingredients and it's gonna stand apart the best edibles out there do cost a little bit more but they are absolutely worth it and almost invariably true if a product seems to be too good to be true in terms of price it absolutely will be so stay away from anything that seems to be too good to be true in terms of pricing and make sure that you know edibles are expensive guys so don't be surprised when you have to pay 22 bucks for a hundred and eighty milligram chocalate bar that's just gonna be the way it is out here but again you get what you pay for so if you pay that premium for that chocolate bar that fancier looking brand you're almost certainly going to be rewarded in terms of potency or taste or whatever the case may be so you absolutely get what you pay for and guys those are our five tips there just to run through them one more time don't trust weed maps or your bud tender for your recommendation do judge a book by its cover stick to those reputable brands number three baked goods are goods chocolate is the best stay away from gummies number four look for those independent lab testing results and then number five you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles what you pay for is what you get so if the deal seems too good to be true it very likely is and guys that's gonna do it just follow those five tips and you should be ready to enjoy some high-quality edibles and if you guys have any other tips or pointers that you want to share just leave a comment below and we'll

Kevin and I are going to be trying three items from the UK these were sent to us from Eleanor and there is a thing with these three items its gun so we have mr. Sims strawberry of bubble gum candy bar and we have a bubble gum flavor of nougat can I have a starburst two ago these are actually go so this mr. Sims strawberry bubble gum candy bar is made by Daniels delights and stoke-on-trent if you want to know who made it it is a strawberry bubble gum bark cocoa butter based confectionary with bubble gum flavor strawberry flavor natural red color blue color and bubble gum sweets so there are little pieces Kevin can hold up hold outs of what kook dollars yes so I just cut it yes it is broken I'll get Kevin does show you I love some in the bag huh so I was held together literally Baba candies the coke bottle was the glue so on the other side there are little squares yeah it's individual little squares sort of you can be simple how don't taste both of them mm-hmm no it tastes like those oh you know the white it's Naima chocolate it's white almost like dipped in chocolate in here the white chips did you melt that's what the almost tastes like how do I get the aftertaste of iboga now that a little bit bar tastes like strawberry yeah those bottles that's where you can buy bread it is one hair per sound pure bubblegum flavor even though I said there was government wavering in the driveway yeah I did not get bubblegum in the chocolate it's a good strawberry bar it's very light it's nothing strong that at first it just tastes like one was white melting things yeah then I got the strawberry after ah yes yeah as we takes in a minute but the Bubblegum is in the gummies primarily so if you good idea to go to you don't get one of those then you're not gonna get to get one but I think it's a good bar don't so different and this is a bubblegum flavor nougat it is the real candy company in Lancaster Road in car Nevada if you ever had honey but for people that did any kind of working with epoxies and stuff that looks like an epoxy bar that you uh you cut a piece off me you squish it all together right and it makes it pop - you stick it in stuff so it's it looks a little but you want to be able to get both well that was a little bitty piece mmm it looks like an eraser mm-hmm it does have a good lower them mmm-hmm does a good bubbledom like lemon that would be dangerous for me hmm because the textures are really good too hmm the texture is very very nice it has a really good vibe room I mean it's a lot to chew yeah so your mouth is being kept busy and it that is out like it's dipped enough and firm enough to where it doesn't like dissolve your mouth really really fast no it's almost like chewing gum yeah swallow swallow that's good although I like that and this is it's his new sugar-free starburst chewing them you get 48 fruity mixes it says because there are three pieces in so they must have different flavors yeah so yeah we have it looks like rings yeah you have a red and yellow and green pieces so let's try yellow no do it together hmm tastes like it tastes like juicy fruit no the yellow package that's what just one good it's just like a yell of juicy fruit gum I don't know if they have juicy fruit in the UK so I'm gonna take that out because I want to try to add the right a red one yeah that's exactly doesn't it's like a fruit mm-hmm no that does that taste every sovereign mm-hmm yes it's a very very strong strawberry for that for that little bitty piece I mean this these are smaller than Chiclets Downers are smaller than chickens and that strawberry is very strong so now lastly we have to go green that is um Apple which is surprising from the UK because that what you do i I know I'm surprised I'm surprised they'd have Apple too because like in there they're uh skittles they still have long but that is that's Apple okay so now we'll try together it's a very soft I'm just gonna add a yellow and red to that green oh no God that was do red yellow it's good all together but honestly that strawberry is so strong that he completely overpowers even the Apple but I think it I like it I like it a lot it is very very very very sweet right now let's get up to it I don't think you'd be able to of them I think it would get hard oh you think it's one of those guns that you can't chew for like 30 minutes it's gonna be like a five-minute pin that gum then you guys spit it out it's gonna be hard right well I'm just shocked that's what it seems like that's the sweetness level but I mean it's like oh yes so that's most of the yellow ones yeah yeah I mean it it's very very very to me that strawberry fiber it's very strong yeah so I like this if I chewed gum then I would definitely get this yeah I think it's definitely yeah I quit chewing gum I love gum but I quit chewing it just because I'm not a pretty gum chiller you know I'm I just have seen myself chew gum I mean it's just not pretty so I don't do it anymore I just eat mints but I do love come and they did a good job of that so that is very good but my even though everything here is very good my favorite thing is about good yeah that is so I just love it the texture and everything is wonderful scoop so thank you very much Eleanor personally says we really appreciate it I'll have a picture for you Oh at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "SysslUhKwzE": "what is going on my peeps my name is David welcome back to this week's video god dammit my damn video now if you guys remember a few weeks ago when I made you this promise so it's gonna be between two to four plus videos per week yeah if you've been around here for any extended period of time you will know that I am NOT great at keeping the promises that I make sometimes although this one still has hope I'm just you know giving you a fair warning if I don't get two to four of this week but anyway some of you may remember that a long ways back I made jello Legos with these molds which did take me a couple of tries but they ended up looking okay and today I figured I should try to get more than one usage out of these $23 Lego molds I decided to take some inspiration from a tipsy bartender and all the other channels that have been doing shot glasses made out of Jolly Ranchers recently and use that same concept to make these Legos instead now there's a couple different ways that I'm considering doing these one of which I am assuming is going to come out the best but I will try a few so let's get right into it now if you are if you are out there that is more intelligent than the YouTube algorithm meaning that you have at least one brain cell and you make any amount of sense at all you would be able to assume that we need a whole lot of Jolly Ranchers for this project if this video gets taken down by YouTube you all know why but what I decided to do was to tump out the entire bag and to separate each of the five colors into their corresponding bulbs while also unwrapping each individual candy piece and this step is just about as fun as this time-lapse looks but once you complete that we can move on to the first method that I will be attempting and that is the double boiler method I've seen people melt down different types of hard candy like this before which is why I think that this might work so I've started with a few of the cherry flavoured because I tended to have the most of those and get even a while to melt down in the bulb and if you guessed that this was going to be a thick sticky mess than you were absolutely correct every single utensil I tried to use to stir this just did not work and got stuck everywhere the candy never really melts down completely to a liquid form it just stays really thick and the second you take it off the heat it thickens up even more so I tried my best to put the mixture in one of the little molds and let it cool down which as you can imagine was also at a C and a half but I guess when I took it out of the fridge it kind of worked a little bit but I think we can do a lot better for method number two all I did was stuffed each mold with different colors of the Jolly Ranchers I used four in each of these blocks which I'm hoping won't be too much or too little and once I had one of those molds completely filled I threw it in a 400 degree oven for about seven to eight minutes that's it for you if you're gonna try to make these things if you see a ton of bubbles in the top of the candy that means your oven is too hot or you left them in for too long but all you really have to do is just go in and try to pop them with a toothpick or a different sharp object just a little bit of extra work so avoid it is possibly but once I had done that that into the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes until it hardened up and these look a ton better they still didn't take perfect shape of the molds they really didn't get all the divots in it and you can kind of see the crevice where all the candy is kind of melted together so I made one more batch like that and they came out just about the same the last thing I want to try with these though is to do the same method but halfway through the baking process put another different mold on top so that way the divots from the top mold will hopefully melt down into the candy so you can stack them together I did a few batches with that method and they came out even better than the last one so I tried to build some stuff with them I tried to make a nice little candy staircase and I guess that came out pretty cool I tried to make a YouTube logo which came out pretty crappy if you ask me honestly and lastly I tried to build a wall with an accurate representation of the theoretical integrity of Donald Trump's [Applause] one last piece of advice I do not recommend being overly aggressive with these or dropping them from any sort of height because they're kind of fragile and will chip a lot being that they're hardened candies they're actually almost on par with being just as fragile as a drama channel's YouTube career but I hope you enjoyed

today is a exciting day it is barely 7:52 a.m. so like almost 8 o'clock and I just watched my face brush my teeth and it took some midol because I actually got my period this morning which is just awesome today in this video it's not gonna be about my cramps no no no honey today we is getting late but for the like being best fan so I plan on eating this right now so that way and like about an hour after I do my hair will be ready to do my makeup and humvee Heights bug so that's exciting but I wanna show you guys while I eat this this is cookies and cream flavor and it says it is by the brand 420 brownie I don't really know I'm not too sure yeah so it's so funny because on the back it literally says only start with a sugar cube piece sized piece wait at least 2 hours in all capitals it says 2 hours to feel the full effects but you know we're gonna eat as much as we can right [ __ ] now so - you're poppin so [ __ ] chocolatey like I don't want to eat it it's gonna be so torturous maybe this I know some people are probably like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] I would love to eat that and it's like yeah I want to be high but I don't wanna eat this like [Applause] do what it looks like very chocolatey it's um cookies and cream so not only is it the brownie there's double the chocolates of the cookies oh my gosh I don't want to eat this ah tastes like mint cuz my toothpaste I remember when I was younger I watched one of these videos of um a girl who actually had purple hair she's not even YouTube gray anymore I don't know what happened to her forgot her name actually her name was Erica cannabis and she had a video of her eating a brownie like this kind of but I don't know how many milligrams it was that by the way if you guys didn't know this is a thousand milligrams of thousands so that's kind of a lot okay a lot of people usually take like 100 milligrams 200 300 500 is a lot this one's a thousand so yeah I wish it was smaller so I could just eat the whole thing you know like one bite but the reason why I brought up Erica cannabis is um old video is because she was like oh I don't want to eat the brownie and nasty and I was like what the [ __ ] like I've never had an edible because I was like so young at the time watching that video and I remember being like what the [ __ ] this girl doesn't want to eat her brownie I'll eat it for her you know but now it's like no [ __ ] I understand because this is a struggle at least I got to film this video with like white peas and I'm like with white keys rather than like with the yellow tooth like you know my haters mad you had to find something new to hate on about me mmm haters mad Oh watch me you my brownie [ __ ] Oh Oh big bite mmm I hate it I don't like the taste I don't like it it's just too chocolatey it is 8 o'clock and I will check back with you guys in an hour I just came downstairs to get some water it's already 8:30 and I don't really feel anything yet so honestly get me eat some more no casually somewhere you know [Music] I probably will in the middle of my makeup to him I'm gonna have one eye done I'm a crazy go what could I say [Applause] okay here's how much I have left look okay mm-hmm oh I just threw up in my mouth and swallowed it like no [ __ ] joke what's stopping everybody it is your desk and it is currently nine o'clock right now and if you guys were here at the beginning of the video then you know that I ate this 1000 milligram edible at eight o'clock and then at 8:30 actually ate like a whole nother big huge piece so I'm sure throughout this video this edible is just going to be hitting me harder and even harder right now I really don't feel it I don't feel completely sober though I feel the train starting to blast off yeah but anyways enough of my chit-chatting let's just get on me to it so right here in front of me I have a mirror with my makeup brushes and online makeup products I kind of have a lot like compared to other people like beauty gurus I probably have like nothing but to me I I have a lot of makeup but like yeah probably not [ __ ] compared to some people just gotta start off with the hand sanitizer you feel me you gotta have them clean nice and fresh hands by the way if you guys didn't know a lot of you guys every single time I wear this choker and like a snapchat or Instagram post somebody always asks where did I get it from and this is a life beand st list stay up and stay positive choker it has three stars so just a little reminder toy stay lit stay up and stay positive to me it has lots of meaning and I really like it if you guys want to get your very own they'll be available April Friday the 13th I'll make sure you mark our calendars boo link is always down below in the description to all my merch but yeah Frank Luther King oh no I dropped something haha not a surprise so I'm gonna start off with my moisturizer this is you 365 daily moisturizer with sunscreen broad broad spectrum SPF bug oh my gosh I I thought I already [ __ ] up I got way too much moisturizer how did I already [ __ ] up oh my gosh that's how you know it's gonna be a black eye oh it's not a I'm not a bad video maybe just like an off video you know you eat a thousand milligrams edible one you're already [ __ ] up okay let me go wipe my hands okay so my hair behind my ear is [ __ ] gay all my hair but yeah of course gotta keep y'all skin moisturize you feel me can't be looking crusty so there we go nice layer of moisturization yone on our skin and then I kind of let that dry up a little bit just so it's not all juicy and wet and moist and then I died right on in - you know that the good older what do you even call this primer I'm not a beauty guru guys I'm really not I'm actually very bad at doing makeup but I'm gonna try to do this good cuz like this is what I'm gonna wear for the rest of the day so I'm gonna literally try my 150% best to do this like pretty you know and I'm going for like a pretty like every day you makeup look I might do it like a little bit snazzier with some eye shadow and some lashes I've been wearing falsies a lot more and than I ever did in my entire life and I'm already getting if you guys think I should do a video on why I hate and we'll never get eyelash extensions again thumbs up this video so I could do like a whole experience and Q&A maybe all about eyelash extensions because I know what of you guys probably having on them yet and I know a lot of you guys probably do want to get them but girl I've got that a couple of times and from different people from salons from home studios and I just hate them and my phone's ringing who's calling me Yello yep life being guest on the beat yep okay now you're back to the Z video um what do I do next I got a cover up these acne problems cuz do you not see this face girl I know you do I know you see my pimples from a mile away I actually recently bought this foundation it's the LA pro coverage foundation by le girl hmm good thing I didn't go on my kappa pants [ __ ] oh heck no oh my gosh really honey I learn my freakin hair I got my arm again [Music] anyways as I was trying to say jeez you just want to be so rude trying to interrupt me a [ __ ] um I like this foundation I don't think it's the correct color for my skin but it's not like completely off we just kind of like oxidizes a little bit and then becomes a little bit too dark for me but I just kind of fix it with like a light concealer but yeah I ordered this from Ulta online because nowhere in my town do they sell la girl so I really had a guess my color because like obviously I ordered it online and I liked it I mean I don't regret buying it it was probably like five to eight dollars I don't remember exactly how much it was but it was pretty like affordable and I liked it um it kinda looks like pain on my skin like I'm painting my face but like isn't that what makeup is it's like painting your face right stop looking and it's funny because I'm doing a really bad job at blending this in but because I'm on camera I swear it on camera it looks so flawless and I look so pale but in person it looks way tan and then it doesn't look fully blended I hope so yeah always just keep in mind that youtubers I feel like look twenty times cuter through the camera so just you know don't be surprised when you see me add a bath on no I'm just kidding that's a really bad joke because mm I already passed but you get the idea I'm a Yoko has a [ __ ] basically next I do my eyebrows and honestly you guys I think I have been known for like a good year now ever since I started my youtube channel that I'm terrible at doing eyebrows I've always used this on Nastasia dip brow to fill in my eyebrows but just recently I switched to the honest Asya duo brow powder it's like the same thing just powder formula rather than the dipbrow formula which is like I don't know what it is and I don't know powder I think works a lot better for me and the kind of eyebrows I have because my eyebrows are really fine you guys could barely even see them from a mile away that's why I have to fill the [ __ ] out of them and just like you know I've tried yoga I only got eyebrows online so yeah you know I wasn't born with no eyebrows but when I use the dipbrow I guess I just looked like a lot more of a fake [ __ ] so when I use this powder it just works out a lot nicer for me because people don't judge me as hard on my Instagram comments and they actually give me compliments on my eyebrows people decide to be nice you know as opposed to when I use a dip brow people comment saying how fake my eyebrows are and how well it matches my personality oh [ __ ] I'm just roasting myself now oh and also somebody commented on my video recently actually shout out to that person who commented this cuz they said destiny oMG all you do is roast yourself like don't don't put yourself down like you know [ __ ] what anybody else thinks like your eyebrows are popping or everything this pop and you know who cares you know and I was reading that comment and I was like that's so true like who cares you know like who cares if I don't have no eyebrows that's what makeup is for to give me eyebrows you know like it's not a big deal it's just it's a [ __ ] piece of pube on your face like who gives a [ __ ] you know but honestly I love roasting myself because I love myself and how much why I can roast myself and laugh about it and still love myself and still feel like I pop it I'm beautiful even without makeup you know I don't really give a [ __ ] like Shu who do I got to impress honestly I ain't got nobody to impress like I you know life is just so short why live it trying to impress others Wow my eyebrows are not coming out good you guys I kind of just like slap on a bunch of product and then I get the concealer and I try to like actually make it look like I browsed oh like and I feel like once they get them threaded they'll be a lot easier to do right now it's hard for me because I'm really bad at doing makeup in the first place and then I'm a little bit high off of this edible and then my eyebrows just have [ __ ] hair everywhere like what the [ __ ] where do I fill it in you know the struggle is real right I say my say here's my eyebrows honestly if I got mistaken they don't look too shabby like yeah but not the best yeah they're pretty [ __ ] dark but I have had a worst days bill I've had worst days so that makes today a decent day kind of feel like hitting my wax pan because this edibles not doing me justice so Cheers all right so once I'm done doing my eyebrows I immediately jump into conceal oh my gosh the I fell that trying to talk okay cuz I'm already using the concealer for my eyebrows so it only makes sense to do the concealer after your eyebrows cuz then you're gonna need a use of concealer on your eyebrows like I don't understand how [ __ ] could do their concealer first and then do their eyebrows and then do concealer again you know I like to keep it all in one we can seal the brows and then we can sell these under-eye circles right now my pimples I mean my pimples my forehead you guys it literally has like craters on it like I want to zoom in I want to expose myself looking you see those craters okay like you see him you see how like from a distance you can't see them but then up close you could see them that's like the biggest insecurity I have right now is my acne on my forehead because they're not like pimples so I can't like pop them you know like they're not pimples but there's just like a bunch of like little bumps and I've never had that problem I've seen other like high schoolers I went to school with who have that problem and I remember always thinking like haha I don't have that problem and like all my friends would be like you guys and now look at me now look at me now I have that problem and I don't know so you know if you don't have acne right now y'all better not be laughing at me cuz watch watch you in a couple years get your fair share of acne and then you'll be like [ __ ] now what do I do and then I bake I bake these [ __ ] edibles that's what the [ __ ] I'm making after set these eyebrows in place because they like to play so I use this brow gel that I've had for a minute by anastasiya and I'm a broke-ass [ __ ] that I've had this sample for like months and you know it's still going strong and your girls still not having to spend that extra coin because she uses the samples alright anyways enough about my brother [ __ ] problems let's get it poppin with that bronzer so I used to always used a typical bronzing brush you know nice and angled no [ __ ] let me give you the biggest tip of your life I think I'm starting to feel the edible now actually okay anyways you get this brush boom this one's like super narrow and skinny I feel like this is I used to use this on my under eyes like that but now I just use my [ __ ] Beauty Blender for that and I use this from my mother [ __ ] Bora I see mother [ __ ] so much I should really watch my language Wow okay no wonder YouTube dis monetizes me um you know you just I think it makes your bronzer look a lot more like snatch'd would be the word like it makes it look like well [ __ ] you got a nice ass face you know you know what I mean I know you do because look at that it looks good you know and I'm putting like zero effort you guys like I'm the worst at doing makeup and I can make myself look dragoness [ __ ] with some makeup like honestly I'm so bad I do makeup but I need way more poppin with it I think so much cuter like look at me my skin my bronzer my cheekbones my eyebrows okay no we need this highlight crackle oh um I usually use I don't know what happened to it I probably dropped it just like I dropped my future now I'm just kidding um just how to drop everything I don't know happen to it I usually use a NYX spray for when I used to do my highlight but I don't know happen to it for like the 20th time how many times do I have to say don't [ __ ] know what happened - it was here like yesterday now I can't find it so I'm using this one it's a little fancier than the typical water supposedly cuz it's like supposed to be rosewater who [ __ ] knows they're probably lying okay anyways I'm using this highlight from this palette I got it as a present so I really I'm not sure what the name of it is or like how much it was cuz you know broke [ __ ] I would never buy myself this it's by lorac it's probably like 40 bucks for like literally the only not trying to roast on the person who got me this cuz I love them so much and I'm so grateful I have this because I owe you see this later but I feel bad cuz literally the highlighter is the only thing I use and this pilot was a good I don't know how much money put it and you know what I don't really like it that much because sometimes when I'm a high ass and I'm going like this to get my highlight I'll literally get the purple you guys cuz it's right next to the highlighter and I'll go on my face and I'll have a fat ass piece of purple and I'm like what and then I'll look down and I'll be like and then I have to do it like all over again and it's just a hassle so yeah I look so cakey right now like you know you went overboard when your skin looks like you need a blended out quick cuz I'd be looking like the Napoleon Express with my [ __ ] highlight like yikes okay I'm just cat oh I was about to say that I baked yes [ __ ] I baked oh my gosh I forget everything but I burped it tasted like we for the one cut this was like almost 50 bucks and I actually bought this myself and I only use this brown shade literally every day on a special occasion you might see me dip into like the Pink's but honestly I only use one color and I hate makeup you guys I hate spending money on makeup I hate doing my makeup the only thing I do like about makeup is the way it looks and I know my name we know actually I have this oh let's use this boom let's use it okay I just bought this this is from Stila oh my gosh this really made me a broke [ __ ] this [ __ ] was like 25 [ __ ] bucks and look at how much it's already gone like can you guys see that hole I just put the eyelash glue on the eyelash just waiting for that to dry for a sec and meanwhile honestly I'm really sad because I really didn't feel that edible so I'm sad I feel like by now I should be filling my [Music] completed makeup look all I'm gonna do only my top lashes because honestly when I play it okay and then the very last thing is of course that apply so I'm boom and then this is the completed makeup look honestly I think this I came out pretty good but I think this I did not so that was me trying to do my pretty good honestly from a distance it doesn't look too shabby you guys just gonna slap on that liquidy glossy and boom literally call it a day but don't wait and don't let nobody look too close cuz shoot don't be like [ __ ] is there a [ __ ] party on your eyelids cuz there'd be [ __ ] oh my gosh just don't keep in mind don't use as much glitter as I did and you'll be Gucci are everybody that concludes the end of this video honestly looks so fun I'm so sad that I feel like the edible did it hit me as hard like do I have hi of Tolerance they even eaten a thousand milligram a double I don't get high like what really cuz I fell high for a little bit and then I feel like the highest done like I feel like I'm done with the high like already so that's really weird maybe it was because I did it first thing in the morning so I just have so much energy that I just don't feel the high I don't know you guys doing the makeup I did [ __ ] up here and there but

sitting here face to face with you guys I was talking about Coco dogs do you guys remember what that stuff was that was a weird chocolate like candy that kind of looked like actual little green dogs in a glass jar if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll have the link right up here in the top right kind of give you up to speed but I need you more recently I actually got something else in the mail and I want to talk to you guys about that because other than the coconuts which are actual candy this stuff you're getting that camera guy this is just CBD stuff and I actually have another packaging tube that helps matter of fact the company of this the acronyms in the name so look at that so this stuff is actual CBD infused gummy candy and unlike the last stuff that I talked about that this stuffs are actually kind of real it's not it's not just like 100% candy chocolate that's made to look like you know a green ugh the stuff in this little plastic jars actually I mean if you want to want to get technical is somewhat of a psychoactive unlike um that that chocolate stuff that I talked about before so here's the funny and ironic part about all of this you know you look at these two things these two jars full of you know it looks like simple harmless can you buy it like the supermarket and you think about the last thing I talked about which was the coconut one looks like something that you could get arrested immediately for for just having a jar on your person whereas this this stuff right here looks like something that you could waltz into any preschool and you start handing them out to kids without anyone batting a single eyeball and that's the funny part about all of this like it's just the way look how innocent this stuff looks it's crazy it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because it will in the state of Florida you got to be 21 at least from from what I recall but actually by this stuff even though it's completely harmless so we got here is uh neon poppers and everyone's favorite sour gummy worms i realistically they both taste almost exactly alike it's just they're different shapes from the shapes and sizes you can I don't know if you're getting that camera move but there are a whole bunch of little smiley faces there don't worry it on ecstasy but before I begin guys I'd be remiss to not kind of show you some one of the basics that you need just in case you guys don't really understand is where it comes from well what it's actually all about so many of you probably know about the stuff but maybe this is your first time learning about stuff like what is it I've never heard of this before CBD is that like LSD is it gonna like make me see pink elephants and ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools so let me explain really quick just exactly kind of the gist about it is got my handy-dandy whiteboard here perfectly by the way before I begin I'm not a medical expert so don't take my advice as I'm some sort of doctor or something yeah I totally left that field I mean I know I have the Asian face and everything but don't be alarmed because I definitely left the medical field I left to pursue a YouTube career where I rake in around $13 a month honestly the age of 40 is right around the corner and I still have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life so for all you outgoing recent high school graduates that are kind of freaking out about the whole real world thing and have absolutely no idea what they want to do yet don't worry cuz my book - way worse so I'd say a majority of you guys watching this video are probably more familiar with THC not too much can be said about CVD like I said earlier and there's still a common misconception about this kind of stuff especially the top of gram of certain psychoactive effects THC as everyone knows is the most active ingredient in the Disco salad this is the stuff that gets you intoxicated or is in simpler terms hi as I'm gonna do my best to try to avoid super confusing medical top of big science Awards because trust me there was a whole rabbit hole science terminology that this can all really boil down to alright so let's try to understand just exactly how THC you know gets you up there by the way before I begin try your best to not be offended by this little placemat behind here just in case you're one of those type of people basically everyone has in their bodies two types of cannabinoid receptors so let's just call these guys CB 1 and then CB 2 THC only binds to one type of cannabinoid receptor or CB so the cb1 receptors are usually found in the brain unlike the nervous system lungs liver and kidneys and the cb2 receptors are usually found somewhere in the union system there actually might be other CB receptors but that's totally not the topic here by now you probably can guess which of the two receptors THC binds to and that's actually this guy the cb1 receptor so THC see th see why not so THC is basically something that activates or stimulates that receptor and that causes like that cool rewarding effect or like that happy feeling that sometimes people get sometimes too much of it in some cases can get you was seeing like really weird like pink elephants magical dragons or like ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools and unfortunately for some people that cb1 receptor can be blocked and that euphoric feeling that many of groans so custom - just really doesn't work out for them but if you're one of the more majority lucky bunch then well Cheers now one like it's a brother ii cv receptor deals more with things like inflammation and pain management you know these can usually be found in like the gastrointestinal system and this is probably why CBD has a potential to help out people with like PTSD anxiety or other types of weird inflammation that goes on in the digestive tract or like around the body so okay let's break it down in a simpler example and this is lifted from green relief by the way they put it this way just imagine you consume cannabis and the THC and CBD are like a whole bunch of keys which are you know and searched for a lock to open those locks being the receptors these guys they click together with the proper key isn't different messages or scent you know all throughout your body so I'm like THC CBD doesn't exactly bind well with the cb1 receptor so really you kind of just almost don't really feel anything and if you really wanted to you have to take way more in the suggested limit but the worst thing that can honestly happen is like a slate rosiness or an insane state of calmness okay back to the talking Asian you really want to be careful with buying some of this stuff because a lot of the people that sell this kind of product aren't really will informing what exactly they're selling you so like last week before I actually got these things and you know the local vape store looking around for you know products that were similar the only reason I didn't is because the prices online are vastly different than what they are on stores they're actually kind of cheaper online to be honest and the stores are a little over there something like this and a store would probably cost you around 70 bucks online these things are like mid 50s or mid 60s so I walk into the store and I'm like you know I'm asking about him you know I'm asking about this type of stuff and I was asking like what's the whole thing about this almost immediately he just goes yeah bro stuff is totally worth the dude I'd like three or four of them and I was like totally gone in like five minutes dude I was I was I was surprised I was I didn't even know what to say you know before I even go in the store I kind of knew what the stuff was it wasn't well it's not exactly the most complicated thing to understand when he when he said he was gone he was like gone like with like 17 E's that's how gone there's this like his description was and I was you know I was taken aback I was no surprise you know so like three or four seconds after that there was like this like dead silence in the entire store and the only thing that I thought to myself was like dude I really hope this guy does not smoke weed because he's probably the first person that'll overdose on marijuana don't go into these stores thinking that you just found like an insane goldmine of like magical stuff because it's it's not it's not it's not that kind of stuff especially if you're in a state that still doesn't have fly solid recreationally illegal because it doesn't matter if you do that stuff and if CBD does get you like that I sure hope you don't take anything with THC unit so yeah this video is made way back in 2019 so I'm sure 10 years from now we can probably take a look at this kind of video and have a good laugh at it considering the fact like how strict the laws were on like you know this kind of stuff especially the ones regarding disco spinach because those right now even in states where it's legalized that's still federally illegal and it's classified as a schedule 1 drug okay so one of the part that probably wouldn't have you fast forwarded to the the actual product I was able consume a good amount of the bag well in the jar in the past 24 hours I didn't exactly read up on the recommended dose but I guess I should have since this was sort of a hefty sized jar at 300 milligram over 1000 1000 milligrams total so according to the little jar thing here it says that it's approximately 72 pieces you guys can read that there so thousand milligrams 72 pieces you do the math what's a thousand divided by 72 so you're looking about 14 milligrams per little candy thing well this guy this one's I think this I think there was a I think there's more gummy worms was there this had 142 pieces this is the smaller so if this stuff is still closed this has 72 gummy worms in here Oh this one had 148 smiley faces so 1000 divided by 148 okay so about 7 grams 7 milligrams of CBD and you show these little smiley face gummies usually the recommended daily doses I think it was between 15 to 25 milligrams for the stuff don't quote me on that I'm sure everyone's body chemistry is a lot different so in order to affect someone else it could vastly depend on like your size in your weight so my guess is the gummy worms here that have yet to be consumed will be a little bit stronger so I have to eat these in moderation because these guys on the other hand I kind of was just popping in like candy I forgot this was a CBD candy thing like I actually started eating them like as if there were something from like the candy aisle at Walgreens so you pop these in your mouth obviously consumer eager and they literally it's candy there's no hint of like you know when you have like the actual edible stuff from the other stuff you can get a taste of the good stuff this Kandee complete freaking candy so those a bit skeptical at first and how this helps with certain problems like anxiety and pain and you know while I didn't really have the laddering his idea was something that was pretty salient especially when driving around like the state of Florida some of you know me and the majority of my content in this channel is usually you know automotive related useless content right now while I've totally loved cars I absolutely despise driving on public roads that's that's a given fact I love cars but I hate driving and again I live in South Florida so this is kind of known as God's waiting room this is a place where older people move after they've realized that they're too old for other old people they hung out with but you know here's the thing it's not just the elderly which which are kind of terrible at driving a majority the people that drive here I feel like more than half of them have gotten their driver's license from a happy meal and because of this driving around in the state of Florida it kind of puts me on a weird edge the things I can definitely say that this stuff helps me out like like immensely I can't tell you how how much this stuff actually kind of works especially driving it gives me the nice reliable feeling that I'm not gonna get sideswiped by like a Corvette every 13 seconds anybody comes in a whole different types of forms you can get it as popcorn tinctures like something you can drop into say if you don't want any candy if you're someone that's trying to lose weight don't want to delve into the whole unhealthy candy eating process you got chips even got like CBD beef jerky and so they they put CBD and like act like a lot of things nowadays and I know this might be a totally unpopular opinion but I think edibles of anything is the most safest and best way to consume any type of whatever the help no matter what anyone says I think the whole inhalation of smoke and everything really messes with your whole body chemistry you know scarring of the tissue and the lungs and all that weird stuff so hopefully guys this was able to give you a sort of introduction of the whole alternative world of CBD let me know in the comments below it sure not only helped me but it helped anyone else that's trying to you know figure more stuff about figure out more stuff about this stuff other than that guys I got nothing else for you if you guys wanna help support my channel or visit my website it got merged stickers hats and other things literally out here calm and click everything yeah I don't I'm not a very good salesman I just had to say that at least the bare minimum I'll see you guys in the next video in the next vlog in the next whatever peace [Music]", "MhrJHGTpnpI": "welcome to Kois corner a channel for personal and spiritual growth if you enjoyed this video please feel free to like subscribe and leave me a comment letting me know why a few weeks ago I did a video on CBD and how it really helped my life at a time where I could have gone down a negative path due to things I was dealing with and YouTube removed it they took it down they struck it they gave it a strike even though it's legal compound essentially without explanation which I'm currently appealing but I don't care I want to talk about CBD and specifically the benefits that we can get from CBD the science of it how it can help us because it is a magical magical compound that I think can do so much good so what is CBD well to be completely honest CBD just stands for Kenna video I think I pronounced that right which is one out of over a hundred strains of cannabinoids and cannabinoids are pretty much just chemical compounds that share the same structure the same derivatives as THC as cannabis as marijuana which we smoked in certain ways and CBD is one of them but it is arguably the most important and most practical for us so before I go any further I got this question on my last video to the CBD that I personally use is by herb strong it's full spectrum CBD a thousand milligrams for this tincture it's my favorite CBD I've tried a few different CBD types this is the one that I work with and that works best for me I don't promote anything really ever on this channel but I will promote this because it works so that's my thing so the reason though CBD is so amazing because like we said it has the same chemical derivatives as THC but it doesn't have all of it so what this means is that all scientific level we can get the health benefits from marijuana without the high CBD is not psychoactive you do not get high from CBD you do not get the munchies your eyes do not get red you don't get any of those leftover side-effects any of those conscious sort of alterations you just get the health benefits and this is why it's so magical because some people understand the health benefits of marijuana but they might not like getting high I know so many people who understand that but don't want to get high and this is the compound for you if that's the case because many jobs drug test many of us play for sports teams which drug tests we can't use these compounds who can't do this we might have legal problems where we can't do that either all these different things can be bypassed so we can get the health benefits that come from cannabis through CBD so essentially CBD is kind of like an under the surface effect or the same way that tylenol works we're taking it for an intended purpose but we're not feeling it as it acts out its own process and that process is interesting to scientifically how the CBD works is that we as humans have awesome awesome bodies so we have cannabinoid receptors in the brain and in the nerves throughout our body so when we take CBD it binds with those receptors and since the receptors aren't just in the mind but are also in the body CBD and the number one benefit which will now get into it is the fact that it is a natural painkiller it is amazing for helping us deal with chronic pain and painful issues with the body I myself got into a motorcycle accident about eight months ago ever since through therapy through everything I'd still had a slight really annoying chronic knee pain because of it that just won't go away and when I use CBD I can notice that pain disappear it's absolutely incredible which saves me for having to use opioids or certain addictive medications with side effects instead I can use something natural and safe that's one benefit that's the physical benefit but it also effects and connects to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain so what this means is that it also works for curing anxiety and depression for helping us alleviate the symptoms that come with experiencing anxiety depression CBD is amazing for this the same reason people smoke weed to relax you can take CBD and get those health benefits too so if you are having problems with anxiety with depression with restlessness of the mind CBD is an incredible place to start to see if it helps you get into that space of peace because when it does then we could try other things to combat it we can try meditation we can try yoga we can try breath work but getting into this space of clarity is best done with a friend and that friend can be CBD in this case along with this on a more serious note CBD also helps people with epilepsy kind of lessen the amount of epileptic events they have it helps patients with Alzheimer's it also works against leukemia and in certain cases which we're starting to study now it actually kills cancer cells slowly in breast cancer that's amazing so CVD doesn't just work with pain management or with anxiety but can also work with serious diseases too now the best part and I think the number one selling point for people with CBD that can be used on a grand scale is the fact that it is non addictive not me just saying it's not addictive but the World Health Organization itself ran a study and agree that CBD is absolutely not addictive in any way can it become something of dependency on a physical level unlike even marijuana which we can depend on mentally she doesn't even have in a six-week study six weeks where every single day multiple patients took 700 milligrams of CBD which is pretty much all that's in here out of a thousand that's probably 700 so imagine all of this every day that's a lot for six straight weeks a month and a half and once they stop the next day there were no physical withdrawals there were nothing zero completely fine as if they had taken nothing at all that's a very rare thing for any compound that can help the body let alone one that has no negative side effects at all really this is why she would be so great for people that have addiction problems that have this kind of extremist attitude toward drugs and I know I'm one of those people when I drink or when I used to smoke or take psychedelics I would just go gung-ho with it fully in all the way CVD doesn't give us a place to worry about that we'd also worry about addiction because there isn't any and CBD hasn't been around for just a short while it's not some new thing we're now discovering CBD was identified in the 1940s that's over 70 years ago but we fade it away from cannabis in the Reagan era with all the propaganda against it with reefer madness even before that and people got on to the opioid movement but now as opioids out numbered as prescription medications specifically outnumber the amount of deaths that illegal medications or illegal drugs I should say such as heroin crack cocaine all these different things to cause deaths first person's cause more so we're looking for a way to get out of that prescription mentality we want something safer we don't want to worry about addiction we don't want to have to worry about getting that fix or about going into the doctors and now being stuck with this drug addiction for life we want to be free from those worries and CVD helps us transcend those scares that is why if CBT is such an incredible compound not just only has all these amazing effect but also keeps us safe from harming ourselves that's incredible that's amazing I really don't know of anything else like CBD currently there are very few compounds which can have such immense benefits and so few negative traits so I highly suggest you check CBD out this is my video on CBD it's really that simple it's cookie cutter it's very straight to the point and whatever research you do you will see that it represents the same exact things that I talk about in this video it truly is a universal reality so if you have any questions or comments please make sure to LIKE subscribe and leave those down below and I'll do my best to get back to them and as always I'll see you guys next time Rob", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to

nice long work date I'm still kind of amped up took a pre-workout probably around two o'clock so I still have all kinds of energy right now and I'm just kind of kicking it so I'm on my way home from work now I need a way to relax and just chill out so I have some CBD gummies I'm gonna try taking these bad boys tonight and see what happens I'll let you guys know go way too much energy like I said so hopefully these work and do the job and I'll probably take two of them one gummy has 15 milligrams to see me pee in it here we go some of the orange one for the first one and then we've got a red one for a second one so there we got two gummies 15 milligrams three milligrams total I would get back to you guys got about 15 minutes drive home may I make some dinner and I'll report back we got going on all right so it's been about 40 minutes since I've taken hemp bombs CBD gummies and with not gonna lie I'm definitely out more chill than I was before I came home to the shower prepare my dinner and now I'm gonna eat my dinner a lot more chew I think I'm just gonna right into the evening more steady on the chill side right now versus being all hyper and energetic what it was earlier so they worked I hope you all have a good night [Music] all right so as you guys just saw a man outside kick the soccer ball jumping a little bit soccer is one of my favorite things to do in my spare time and as a hobby so far I haven't felt anything from the CBD oil it's been about 15-20 minutes to say so I'm just out here trying for some more energy so I'm gonna put it back in about 20 more minutes hey y'all I'm back I pretty much Tower gains hired about 10 minutes ago so I'm about 40 minutes in of taking them to 1,000 milligram CBD oil tincture definitely much more chill my mental clarity is like just kind of relaxed and I'm just kind of just ready to dig in for this afternoon adieu sir computer work and just kind of show out so it definitely worked really well I was like super hyper and just like a lot my mind just going really super fast and now I'm just kinda just like more chill out which I appreciate the fact that it can do that so you know I'll keep you guys up a day on any other future products and stuff that I try but that one is really good and um some scoot it some work done here now hope you guys have a great night [Music]", "_uIN_AnfIGc": "hello everyone time for the next foodie review sour lemon Mamba what's good about tastes like lemonade so I give it an eight out of ten I'll see you guys next time bye bye", "TRH6ILwCdVY": "it's time for something so juicy today on walking the candy aisles hey guys Jeff here excuse me with a review for you of starbursts original and not just any starbursts original as you'll see from the description right up there this is actually starbursts original the UK variety that's right I have actually already reviewed starbursts original the American version of it and I loved it I just got to say that just not to get my hand away but I really dig starbursts I think they are fantastic some of my favorite candies out there this is the UK variety which is different than regular than American starbursts notably with a couple flavors one which is not even available here so you've got orange strawberry lemon and lime together yeah I guess rum in the American variety it's just lemon and in the UK variety blackcurrant no cherry to be found in the UK version of starbursts although UK just I think got recently got starburst fave Reds so I wonder if they have cherry in that SKU not totally sure about that but good good to have this so it's actually even made slightly differently to in the UK I know there's a different base oh okay then they're green packages look at these these packages are actually more brightly coloured than the American version each one of these individual ones anyway I'm excited to try this guys I've never had the UK starburst before so should we give the black currant a try first probably probably should let's see as expected they have this great rap ring on them great design work Cerberus just jump out at you I love them because they're fruit chew candies with with such amazing flavor they're so flavorful that whoops that's that they're just some of my favorites and flavorful in the kind of way that I like like a skittles flavor fault as opposed to a Jolly Rancher flavorful that's always back on Jolly Rancher but like it's not my thing anyhow so there it is there's your fruit shoe it's kind of a soft taffy style of candy and and and there it is it comes in these little squares I love the fact that they have a multi pack with different flavors in it and let's give blackcurrant starburst a try and and see how it fares huh mm-hmm well what is it about black currant that makes it like more popular flavor in the UK because there are a couple of different things candies at a black currant flavor from the UK I can't think of a single thing that's black fruit flavored from from the states it's just not a flavor found in in candies hmm well it's very strongly biker flavor maybe you've heard a little stronger than I would like but that's okay I think this is just my you know American flavor sensibilities getting used to it it's good I mean it's good I'm more used to like you know if we're gonna have a purple it's obviously gonna be great black currant I'm sorry that's obvious to me because that's clearly what it would be um like an American or you know in Canadian we would probably ever even think that it would be black currant we would just automatically assume that it's gonna be a grape um that's a good flavor I like it I don't love it I think that the that the that it would probably be better was a grape to be completely honest but then again I think that there are probably also people out there who would like that a lot and look when I say I don't like something here this is by margins guys take into account I gave the original starburst American version of full five out of five I consider it one of my favorite candies unfortunately one of my favorite candies that they don't end up eating as much as I wish I did as I wish I had time and capacity for look at that well this is really a different flavor to Sarvis don't really smell like anything gotta be honest but let's give this one a try lemon-lime mixed together sort of a citrus smorgasbord hmm I expect good things from this because the lemon starburst is amazing hmm oh yeah mm-hmm man that's good oh great really good mmm yeah it's like sour but like that great mix of lemon and lime sour you know it's uh not purely lemon maybe not not as sweet I guess as the pure lemon flavor maybe that's something else that you'll see in UK candy more because or lemon lime as well as the black curve both have an edge to the flavor that some a little heightened like blackcurrant has that um that current tang you know you know I'm talking about and um hmm and then again cherries can be pretty strong too I suppose the evening flavor is always the strawberry and oddly in in the American originals starburst skew the strawberry comes in pink packages I guess that's cuz the cherry is in the red and that would make sense so saying the packaging of these rapid ones wrapped ones are different this is different but it looks almost exactly the same love this glow going huh it just jumps out at you um but yeah like I said in the American version this is um pink and then the bread is for cherry not that I need to necessarily eat a strawberry finish with you because it tastes the same to me um I did say to have a different base um that they make the taffy out of I don't know what it is but I do know that I've heard that UK starbursts are vegan there's no um I don't know what they do cannibal renderings in the wax enos or something I don't know um anyway these are totally vegan yeah strawberry so good guys is the most popular flavor for a reason mmm holy moly star birds are delicious okay so here's my take the starbursts original UK is different not in a bad way just different I think that I still prefer the American skew because the lemon-lime is great and an interesting mix I would like to see this I don't know maybe this is I don't actually know offhand what's in the tropical skew of starburst but it would be a good addition for that no that's probably full of like mango and things um but I think I probably prefer the lemon to the lemon line and just being a straight straight sweet although I really do like it and the blackcurrant it's just not really for me it tastes good it's got everything that like people love about starbursts so if you are a starburst fan I think that this is something to try well but I think I'd still prefer the cherry even though I'm not necessarily a huge cherry guy I think I'd rather have the cherry in my mix then the black currant overall though this is a fantastically put together product and the the qualms and quibbles I have with it are purely like personal like I really feel like if you're a starburst fan that this is something to try out and just even know that the starbursts q in the UK is different than the starbursts q in America is a good thing so if you have an opportunity try them both you know why not try them all because man starbursts are great candies there's just overall great candies probably the best fruit chew candy out there and probably it is it is the best fruit chew candy out there completely so I got to give starbursts originals UK a huge recommendation I'm gonna give it a full 5 out of 5 like I said even though I'm not I still prefer the American version of this better I think that this is a really fantastic product and anyone who likes this kind of a candy is this is like this is the top tier of course it is so a good job Wrigley good job Mars good job starburst great work definitely interesting and I'm glad I got a chance to try this with all of you so thanks everyone for watching please click the links you see on the screen if you'd like to see more different alternate reviews of different different candies and chocolates and stuff and I

Caleb here with Hemp Daddy's Therapeutics. And I'm here today to\nanswer one of the questions I get asked the most, and it's Does CBD make you high? And how does it make you feel? This is one of the\nnumber one search queries in Google that lands\npeople on our website, so I know a lot of you are answering it so I thought I'd do a\nlittle YouTube video on it. But before we get started, we gotta talk about what the\ndifference in THC and CBD is. So, THC is the component of\nthe plant that gets you high. CBD is a whole 'nother\ncomponent of the plant. It's another cannabinoid. So, the cannabis plant, hemp as well, has a whole array of cannabinoids. All of them have medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. CBD being the number one\nmedicinal and therapeutic benefit out of all of the cannabinoids. That's why all these\ncompanies are isolating CBD. One of the things you're\ngonna start seeing here in the future is people isolating other\nthings like CBC and CBG. Because they all have unique medicinal and therapeutic benefits. So THC, on the other hand, is the component that is responsible for getting you high. But it does also have therapeutic benefits such as reducing the size of tumors and helping with pain management as well. But CBD, on the other hand, it's got all those medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits and many, many more, but there's no high associated with it. So if you have, whatever it is, whether it's a moral issue, or you just don't like\nthe feeling of being high, like CBD will not get you high. There's no chance of it at all. You could probably drink an entire bottle and not even get high. You know, don't go out and try that, I'm not advocating that at all. But because there's so much CBD to THC, like basically CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC. So, let's say you smoked a joint, for say, if you did that along with a dose of CBD, you're not gonna feel as high as you would if you just took THC alone. So CBD has no psychoactive effects, so there's not risk of\ngetting high with CBD. It just has all the medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. So let's talk about how it makes you feel. So, basically, it just\nmakes you feel good. So, I kinda relate it to a runner's high. When you get that flood of endorphins and you just feel great,\nyou feel positive, you're completely lucid, your\nmind is in the right place. It's kind of the same as CBD. And honestly, it kinda\nbecomes like your new normal. So let's say you take\nCBD for the first time, you're probably gonna\nreally feel the effects. But after you've been\ntaking it for a full month, you're not gonna notice\nthe effects as much even though they're still there, it just becomes the new normal. Like, you start feeling better. So if struggle with stress,\nor anxiety, or depression, like those things can\nreally benefit from CBD. And so, if you just wanna take CBD just to relax at the end of the day, to wind down, to sleep better, CBD is great for these things. You'll feel nothing but positive benefits. There's no negative side effects. You're not gonna feel tired and drowsy just because you took CBD. So basically, CBD works by\ncalming your mind, that's, so when I say it helps with sleep, it helps with sleep by calming your mind. So if you're the type of person whose mind is always racing when you go to bed and you\nhave a hard time sleeping, CBD is gonna help with that. But if you take CBD during the day, it's not gonna make you sleepy, so don't worry about that. And again, CBD does not\nmake you high whatsoever. It's the THC that gets you high. So if you're taking CBD oil, if it's a full spectrum,\nor a broad spectrum, it doesn't matter, there's not gonna be enough THC content in order to get you high, so consume CBD and you're\ngonna get all of these positive and great benefits with no risk of getting high.

marijuana can be consumed in many different ways in this video we will be looking at the difference between smoking and edibles uses that smoke marijuana place it into a cigarette containing tobacco this is known as a joint or smoke it through a bong or use a hollowed-out cigar called a blunt when smoking the psychoactive compound THC is gratitude Delta 9 THC which binds to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain causing constant stimulation of neurons quite like a pinball machine during smoking THC is rapidly absorbed from the lungs into the blood circulation from there it crosses the blood-brain barrier smoking gives a faster high because of this however has a shorter duration when compared with edibles when making edibles aka space cakes THC is dissolved into fats such as butter due to its lipophilic properties the THC is once again converted to Delta 9 THC due to the heat applied when cooking achieving the high when taking edibles usually takes much longer from anywhere between thirty minutes to two hours this is because the drug is absorbed by the girl and then processed by the liver in the liver the Delta 9 THC is converted to 11 o H THC this chemical is highly potent and has a higher affinity for the cannabinoid receptors in the brain therefore giving a stronger and longer high when consuming edibles there are many other factors that affect a person's high such as the strain of cannabis use the quantity and the person's history such as mental health and previous drug experiences however it is often a lot harder to predict how high you will get when on edibles due to the change in potency of the THC chemical luckily enough marijuana is not toxic so there won't be any long-term side effects or chances of an overdose just the potential going on a bad

this is the squiggle squiggle squiggle squiggle squiggle on our strawberry puffs yeah swegles well it's not a hard word I just looked at it funny these were a dollar 25 each at a store called five below and they have lots of candy in there just one it does look like just get me warm so that's my water and how are these different than regular regular trolly gummy worms it says three pieces or eighty calories they have strawberry grape cherry orange and lemon lime those are the three warms that are in the package the Mixmaster good they smell very nice looks like really it looks like regular gummy worm are they maybe longer they look very long they do they these these look yeah I think the shape of it looks more like a a snake yeah do you want to do us one cuz yeah two flavors yeah we'll split it we'll try to split it right now well here's the what are you apart this is a red wine that is strawberry and grape it should be you're tougher gummy mm-hmm it's good though oh my god it's good but I'll be honest the the flavor is hardly there at all yeah I got the strawberry I got strawberry I got great but it's just it's very mild very much the textures a little tougher than a traditional yummy so what do we have cherry and orange yeah these are like gum this is bad flavor-wise huh if you have a really dried out like spice draw I mean like those gumdrops but really dried out and they've been sitting out for long enough they've done a texture together with the cherry was an orange was much better but it tastes any orange on mom but I did get cherry I got a little bit did you get a little I'm not strong but I like the flavor of that one this one last one is lemon long hmm good strong I'm Laura I don't like that this tastes like furniture polish very long those are okay I would buy I mainly got lemon well and now I've got the long two that was nasty I would never ate that lemon I would buy this period I would buy regular gummy bears or gummy worms yeah the trolly phonics I like that yeah I just I did not care for that lemon lime on it oh it's just like furniture polish and the strawberry drape was so mild you might as well not have been eight knit and the only good one was the cherry orange and you mainly just Jared yeah so these are trolley strawberry puffs now we may have had strawberry candies trolley strawberry but I don't remember being called puffs that's why bottom high-flying floating fluffy soft and squishy cloudberries and they'll make you say it's cloudy with a chance of all berries well if these are gonna be like the ones who bought the Brittany five pieces and hunter ten calories so oh wow that smells good like that so one side is pink in the other side is white no they're just amazing that's you we got you mm-hmm I like the texture hmm the sugar on the outside you'll be here okay the strawberry I like the flavor mm-hmm the strawberry reminds me of another candy like a starburst strawberry like creamy like yes I like that creaminess to it those are actually really got this it takes you want and you get three and a half servings five pieces so you get quite a few of those in the buy you think those of the movie the last one yeah I would again buzzer go those are very very good they have a nice strong a creamy strawberry flavor there's some mints to that come like that there's strawberry and white and they're like a creamsicle type but it's strawberry and you know those are worth the money these are the flavors just weren't there and all good like I said there's better gummy worms out there so pass on these definitely and if you see these I would get on them so I'll have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "BjrsG6bplqw": "this thing is really big wow this thing is like large

account for almost half of the nearly 70 million dollars a month earned by local marijuana businesses according to the Colorado Department of Revenue but the market has not avoided controversy over consumption and accidental ingestion have generated considerable negative press so I travel to Denver to learn more about what goes into the production of these sweet and savory pop goodies and to find out is anything being done to resolve its issues today we are with Julie at sweetgrass kitchen Julie is one of the pioneers of the edible cannabis movement hi Julie hello thanks for being here so I heard you are going to let me cook some products right so let's go I'm gonna start baking you ready for me I wish I could the marijuana Enforcement Division requires all employees to have a badge in order to work a licensed marijuana facility I think it's because my paralegal Greg told you I'm a terrible cook so I don't believe you but can I at least help out you got it Oh may I help terrific so what's the next step Julie as we've got to put on our hair nets our gloves and our aprons and we can get started hi gang sweet cross kitchen specializes in butter based edible products we make brownies cookies and a seasonal pumpkin pie both on the medical side and the recreational side so when you say that pot is in your food it's actually in the butter right Hanna water is made when cannabis flowers Lauren fine silver this you are the head chef here at sweetgrass kitchen yeah and you're giving up your duties for the day to me okay so chef do you mind if I help out a little yes we we can help oversee the process okay keep close eye on me ah okay so what are we doing here we're making single serving peanut butter cookies today okay so tell me what to do I'm ready let's go are you guys scared a little bit he's going into a field and hit the bottom of the bowl at something that's very important is that we mix all of our products thoroughly and that ensures that the final product is to Majin s what's the recommended dosage for a consumer someone who buys the products I recommend that if you've never tried edibles before or it's been a really long time to start with five milligrams or less and wait at least two hours if you aren't feeling the effects yet you can always eat more I always tell people you can always eat more you can never eat less Julie I've added half of my dry ingredients what's next after this the next step is portioning out the products into single serving cookies and because you don't have a badge and because portion control is extremely important we're gonna have to let chef Lauren and her team take it from here something that has been a concern in the edibles market in Colorado is overconsumption and accidental ingestion the edible industry is 45% of the market right now the backlash has mostly been with edibles and while you can say okay I recommend my consumer only have half a cookie or one cookie if it's your first time there's no way to control what someone eats right right who in take the pot out of the equation if you send me home with a box of cookies who is just going to eat one there's certainly a responsibility on the consumer level to redirections and of course follow them something that the cannabis Business Alliance and the edibles council has done to minimize overconsumption is create an edibles education handout what we found were four most important points were start with one serving or less wait up to 2 hours don't mix with alcohol or other controlled substances and of course keep out of reach of children and pets and in the original child-resistant packaging in March 2014 according to a report by the Denver Police Levi's fam bah a college student visiting from Wyoming jumped to his death from his hotel room after eating six times the recommended dosage for edibles to sweetgrass kitchen cookie wrappers were found in the hotel room the coroner ruled the death accidental the incident with Levi Samba was was very tragic but it's important to remember that marijuana was not the cause of death when you say marijuana marijuana wasn't the cause of death and maybe I'm just speaking as a lawyer an autopsy was performed on the young man and the autopsy revealed that marijuana was in fact the cause of death well a significant contributor is is that what was in the autopsy report marijuana is not a toxic substance it there's no amount of marijuana that can actually poison someone to the point of death some say that's not true American scientist magazine reported that consuming 100 to 1000 times the effective dose of marijuana could in fact lead to death and while that makes marijuana less toxic than alcohol the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wants to ban the majority of edibles saying they violate the laws requirement to prevent marketing to children since marijuana has been legalized for recreational use there have been many reports of children accidentally ingesting the product and then ending up in the emergency room that is true and certainly a valid concern accidental ingestion by children is something that that the industry has worked very hard towards minimizing through very strict packaging requirements including child resistant packaging very stringent labeling requirements but the good news is that in the past several months there hasn't been a hospitalization of a child so what that shows me is that people are now becoming more aware of the intensity of these products and the importance of keeping it out of reach of children we reached out to Children's Hospital Colorado and they had a different take saying they've treated 14 children this year seven of whom required intensive care the hospital predicts it will treat double a number of children as they did in 2013 and as for sweetgrass kitchen their staff has quadrupled and their profits have increased five hundred percent since recreational marijuana has been legalized", "aWFmkR4B6Kc": "all right you guys welcome on back to home vacation I'm now on this iPhone 10 iPhone X trying to get iMovie downloaded right now and trying to come to you guys with some slightly better content hopefully starting this weekend I can get the tripod up I don't really have a lot of extra product to be recording about but I'll have a weekend to like figure that out anyways anyways let me give you this review here of khiva bliss watermelon lemonade you know there cannabis infused gummies edibles five milligrams per serving twenty gummies per package so it's a hundred milligrams for the total package hundred milligrams THC no CVD um I just mentioned that every time though just so you know because some people prefer to have some CBD in their in their edibles in their products this one's called bliss so another Kiva confections another Kiva product I don't know if you guys recall but originally these were in a plastic bag packaging it was kind of like a thick plastic with that kind of shiny aluminum type of like glossy coating on the inside they recently upgraded to these Camino I guess in Spanish it means like way or path or something like that you know this information let's just pause it here for you it says one gummy see that this is one interesting thing it says one gummy 3.6 grams of you know all these other stuff they've got the serving size is there the sir this wind I mean it says this the gummy is 3.6 grams total calories it says pursuing for one gummy it's 10 calories each so this whole thing would be like 200 calories if you just went out and ate the whole thing um I wouldn't recommend that unless you know what you're doing um got total carbs 2 grams total sugars 2 grams fat none sodium none here's some ingredients for you organic tapioca syrup it's got sugar gelatin malic acid natural flavors such AG acid cannabis extract fruit and vegetable juice 4 color natural terpenes coconut oil and car carnauba wax carnauba wax so I'm guessing that this carnauba wax is the potent active THC type of ingredient um I'm gonna have to look that up and confirm it for you guys because I don't know you can look at all the warnings here heed as you please or you know keep it safe um so let's let's open this again so I'm gonna read this whole thing but go ahead and look at it if you want to so for me this is somewhere between like a hybrid and and the indica it kicks in strong last night I had two pieces of it so that's a total of 10 milligrams it comes with this plastic thing to keep pieces from sticking to the top of the jar and so it tells you what to do we at least two hours before the full effect start with just one piece they're good guys they taste delicious which is one issue with edibles man I wish they wouldn't make them taste so bingo Mike why don't they make them taste like medicine like cough drops or something like you make them like delicious gummy is of course somebody's gonna want to eat a freaking hundred hundred milligrams worth of these things it doesn't matter if it's too much like they taste good um so let's look at a piece here you see they're kind of like one piece is like one diamond shape square shape like this um you see how they have this little like mark in half for most of them I don't know why I'm just guessing maybe that's for dosing maybe people don't want a full five milligrams maybe you want to and a half milligrams because I remember the ones in the in the bag packages were the same um so I noticed like when I open this and I've had this for maybe two days now um it was you see how there's like a little bit of a piece that's kind of like broken or something um man didn't count them but I've eaten a few already I just have one today I had two yesterday doesn't really matter which direction this thing goes um in the jar it is a push push pressure to open so once I close this I can't open it with one hand it's a good product I like it it tastes good it's potent so I'll say the first time I tried the bees and this isn't like a brand new ingredient or anything that they have or anything like that but the first time I tried these when they were in the package like in the little bag package they were um I mean I still like them um I think they're still just as potent I don't recall if it was called bliss before but I know they have like indica sativa hybrid CBD so it's interesting that this one like they're naming them something different now that's also interesting that that that wax that we see on the back here with that ingredient it's also interesting how it mentions like that amount of it's it's interesting um it's also interesting that there's no CVD and it um but yeah so let's let's talk some about about the impacts of the effects of this it's it's potent so it's strong I would say for myself the first times I tried this it was just like other keep of products of edibles every piece is the same potency for the most part if you try to microdose it or cut up the dosages from the five lower down to like two and a half or maybe like one or so milligrams it feels exactly like what you think it's gonna feel like even when you're just cutting up a piece you know it always feels pretty much the same um the difference is I've noticed which really isn't on on Kiva's end it's more in my own end the difference is I have noticed is that when I'm like the first times I had I had these it was just kind of like average work day come home afterward popping out a bold chill you know um added an interesting impact last night though cuz when I was clove in nineteen and coronavirus stuff I've been kind of like stressing out and not really noticing it cuz I'm still going into work I have to go into work and you know I work at a mental mental health spot so uh I'm I have to be there and so it's interesting that um it was yesterday that I had like the highest anxiety and it was like I had one of these you know I got off work had one of these by about an hour and a half I was in my car on the phone had already eaten two of these so I had ten milligrams in my system for maybe like an hour and a half prior and um it was strong it was delicious it was good um but when it started kicking in probably because my anxiety was so high and because I hadn't really slept good in like two three days and because I have probably quite a bit of caffeine inside of my system it was not pleasant and I don't think it was because of the edibles I think I was super paranoid I can explain last night to you a bit like I'm here in California in Southern California there's a terrible rainstorm last night thunder lightning rain like like wind and out here that doesn't even happen so not only was a sleep-deprived highly caffeinated from just all of that catching up and having a late work shift last night and just like drinking some you know I drink and I drink some of this yesterday I don't drink the whole thing on warrants but I drink like half of it maybe and then another much sparkling much of uplifting kind of drink it was and it I drink maybe like a third of that so I was already like well into like 50 or so milligrams of caffeine I'm lacking sleep and I'm very sensitive to caffeine anyways I probably usually have like 10 milligrams of caffeine but yeah I was like over 50 I was probably 60 70 milligrams caffeine that's a lot for me and then lack of sleep and the stress was always Kogan 19 and then I started finally just like talking to my friend about it and then I was like shoot like just kind of opened up a whole can of worms there can but opened up a whole can of worms there of a lot of stuff that I hadn't really been thinking about or talking about or opening up about it was just like dude just kind of pour it on out of me and it was pretty intense and then I right after that trying to go to sleep and feeling highly anxious and super paranoid and then the freaking storm and and the reason why I mentioned where I live is because we don't really have storms like that here um everyone knows that we have Sun and a lot of it and that's what we're used to and that's what I love and I I don't mind rain I know we need it and all that but I mean gosh that was a little intense and then you know trying to sleep and the loud thunder and the flashes of lightning and I'm like oh my gosh like Cove is 19 and like we're all gonna die and like I was I was struggling um but I don't blame Kiva I blame myself um but I just want to mention that you know for people who might be on the highly anxious end I'm I'm kind of like the on edge kind of end of like super stress high strong feeling maybe this I mean I think it'll relax you but it kind of depends cuz I noticed when I have edibles in a high dosage with a lot of stressors under my belt and then caffeine on top of that even if it's like from an earlier time of day like that that's when I've had the most negative impacts and I've probably had maybe one huge experience and maybe 2 to 3 other experiences that were kind of similar to this one I'm explaining like where it's kind of like you know like heart rate and like just kind of like I can't tell like am I supposed to scream or cry or you know just fall asleep couldn't fall asleep because of the weather and like geez but yeah um I'm just kind of venting but yeah this this is honestly all that aside all the paranoia warning aside and talking about my own personal life I would say this is a good product it's still a good product different packaging different same brand for those of you who might also be familiar Kiva makes a chocolate bar that is mom it is good I recently tried the true one I was like a true it has like cinnamon and sugar like oh man yeah it's it's good and these are good to you I like that they have different flavors they don't really taste like we they kind of taste like fruit punch um they're soft the as you can see that I don't keep them in the car I don't keep them anywhere hot where it's gonna melt so that's something I'd recommend keeping in mind they might um but yeah I kept it kind of I keep them kind of in a bag that I take with me like if you want to call it a purse or backpack or whatever like yeah good body hi good cognitive hi almost felt like it like a hybrid at the beginning it kind of kicked in strong it's kind of like you get a little bit of like mental energy there and you notice your muscles and body relaxing and then then like probably like an hour to two hours after it actually kicks in so maybe on the 4 or 5 hour mark for me anyways that's when I start getting the drowsiness in and starting to feel a little tired um and just kind of eventually just suddenly fall asleep without even like knowing um so I've probably mentioned this before I always recommend before having edibles you know first thing if you're in your house go ahead and set your alarm for the morning before I do that before I sit down like I put down my stuff and then immediately set my alarm from when I'm waking up in the morning cuz if I don't do that um you know I'm never gonna set my alarm and I always wake up before my alarm anyways but I'm just mentioning it to you guys who might need to know that yeah but anyways guys thanks for thanks for listening thanks for watching this I don't know how this video even got

told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I hate the whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear yo somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo Davey to the nurse dawg so if by now I have been completely and thoroughly shatters the illusion that I was the angel ik horrific kid that my parents believed I was back in the day this uh this video will surely fix it so this takes place back in high school back in Georgia to Jamaica Jamaica yeah man I was about 14 years old so one morning I get to school and I'm just chilling in my home classroom before the first school bell rings were one of my boys who will call Jeff comes up to me with a big smile on his face he's like yo Don how much lunch money you got today man so automatically I'm like god damn boy I just got a school man why is you begging me for money already dog can't I'll live he's like Don chill just just tell me how much lunch one you got man so I'm like 500 this is Jamaican dollars of course and at a time $300 was a reasonable amount for a day's worth of lunch money but my mama loved me a little bit extra so you know she'd often give me 500 just for context back then I 100 Jamaican dollars was equal to like one American dollar so I told him how much money I got and then he is like cool cool okay okay you should go half with me on a brown so I'm like brownie what brownies is there like a bake sale going on or something just like done no bro I'm talking about Leroy's and brownies dogs so I'm like oh snap Leroy that big dark-skinned dude I'm good I know Leroy he looks like the kind of guy that would scratch himself and then put his hand back in the batter without washing his hands I think I'm gonna have to take a hard pass on that one and Jeff was like done you know about these brownies huh I'm like what about them then Jeff's eyes lit up in that special way that people's eyes light up when they know a secret that you don't you leans in and whispers God these are magic brownies I look at Jeff and I'm like you're kidding he doesn't even say anything just stood there smiling I gave Jeff all of my lunch money you see by this time a lot of dudes in our grade were experimenting with magic but they were only using magic inhalers and that didn't really appeal to me but I was still curious about magic so when Jeff told me about the magic brownies I was like that sounds lazy so yeah I was like sign me up so Jeff takes my money in dips ow 10 minutes later he comes back to me enhance me my brownie wrapped up in foil paper he tells me that I should wait on till lunchtime to eat it and that I should only eat half so I'm like cool I got it I was pumped I couldn't wait till lunch fast forward to lunchtime and everybody has brownies like Leroy Maybank that day man so I'll find Jeff and I'm sitting with him and a group of friends and then we all ate our brownies so we're sitting there in 15 minutes or so passes and I'm not not really feeling anything also lunch was gonna end in less than 30 minutes so I started to get a little impatient on top of that I spent all my lunch money on this dang brownie tomorrow was Heike hungry I didn't have anything else to eat so I hate the rest of the brownie the whole thing I eat the whole thing I even lick the icing off the foil paper man so I'm sitting there and then Jeff comes over to me and he's like yo dumb and how you feeling bro and then I'm like hungry man and a little disappointed I had to hold brownie still pretty hungry and I really feeling any magic as soon as I said that Jeff's face changed from happy and magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I had no whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo take me to the nurse dawg I look over to where the noise was coming from and I see this dude let's call him Amar'e screaming and running across the schoolyard then he gets tackled by some of the other students they bring him over and my man's is tripping hard he was sweating mumbling gibberish trying to take off his shirt just completely losing it so I'm like yo what happened to him and then one of his friends was like man that boy had a whole brownie dog I guess Leroy made this batch extra strong made this batch extra strong I'm instantly begin to panic I mean I was going to die and certainly I was I was going to die obviously here's why Amar'e was one of those dudes that was known to take part in the use of magic inhalers after school so you understand what I'm saying this this guy was an experienced magic user he was an experienced magic user and was still going insane I on the other hand have never used magic and I ate the exact same amount of brownie as he did I was so there I am just panicking internally awaiting my certain death I was sweating profusely I look sick just from the worry and anxiety then Jeff comes over to me and is like yo Don how you feelin man then I was like oh no bro I still don't feel anything too crazy man and it was like as soon as I said that BAM give me and here's the thing when it comes to eating management unlike inhaling it when you eat it he doesn't gradually come on to you one you're fine just chilling and then out of nowhere it's like a magical fairy comes over to you and bashes you over the head with her magic bit sending you straight into lala land I was on it was so bad that I ended up skipping all my classes after lunch there were three distinct feelings that I remember from being under magic spell the first was that time was moving in slow motion and I don't just mean my sense of time which did happen the last 10 minutes of lunch felt like an hour but I mean visually the best way I can describe it is like a visual echo for example let's say someone wave their hand in front of my face it was like their hand left a trail of hands as it moved along its path it completely tripped me out the second feeling was that my sense of touch became hyperstimulated I remember just sitting on the floor in complete agony because the wrinkles in my uniform hurt when my skin rubbed over there like I would rest my arm on my pants and the bulges in the fabric fell as if they were trying to pierce through my skin absolutely awful the last feeling was severe anxiety I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life where I experienced a real traumatic panic attack I was so worried about what you ask I remember in particular I was dreading that my mom was going to pick me up from school and see that I used magic and then kill me so for like the four hours between lunch and when I was supposed to get picked up from school I just sat on the floor Hannah can that my mom was gonna be just so disappointed and angry with me but here's the thing my mom never picked me up from school and I mean never she has a nine-to-five job she's a manager at Bank she's never picked me up from school but for some reason I was convinced that she was coming to get me and when she did she was going to murder me in front of all of my friends but of course instead a taxicab pick me up the same taxicab that had been picking me up every day from school for the prior three years so when I say that it made no sense that I was convinced that my mom was gonna pick me up I mean I have absolutely no idea I thought that but that's what you'd imagine community especially when you eat it at 14 years old so I get home and I immediately just went a bit I slept for like four hours got up and then proceeded to eat all the food in the house all of it like everyone's dinner that my aunt had cooked that afternoon and put in the fridge like four plates of food my G I ate all of it and then went back to sleep moral of the story kids don't do magic man it's a powerful stuff big shout out to the best squad on the internet

episode we are looking at the final Kiva product I think we have reviewed them all now unfortunately as sad as that might be this is the key 180 milligram bar the blackberry dark chocolate flavor super super excited about it every Kiva product I've done from their chocolate buyers to their Terra's their chocolate covered blueberries or espresso beans haven't blown me away every time both in tastes in terms of potency so I'm very very excited for this I believe this cost me $50 at the dispensary but with the discount it was probably closer to 12 or 13 dollars so pretty affordable 480 milligrams well not the cheapest in the world but but you definitely get what you pay for here so let's go ahead and open it up and while I open it up I'll explain the way our reviews work in case you've never tuned in before where reviews work is on the eat this candy bar may be all that in front of you maybe not depending how long it takes but I will eat the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so you can see there keep it right down into these four forty five milligram bars this fancy packaging and the double layer here and most fun this was actually made on 420 of fortuitous so let's go and open it up and try this kiva 180 milligram black berry dark chocolate bar if I can get it open technical difficulties stand by got it I thought I did I did it I open the package guys go me so there we are one of our 45 milligrams rectangles there got a little pot leaf on it mmm and that is delicious love it well another winner in terms of keep taste from Cuba but for how it's gonna make me feel guys that's gonna take two hours or actually a little bit longer than two hours because I'm about to go see spider-man homecoming right behind us here so I will see you right up from the movie to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching guys and I will see you in about two-and-a-half hours peace [Music] hi guys welcome back to mates it's been something like almost three hours since I last checked in with you since I had meet Kiva a hundred and eighty milligram blackberry dark chocolate and I am still feeling quite high three hours later loved it tasted great feeling super high I mean I outrageously high but very high for a hundred 80 milligram edible can recommend this Kiva just like into the others no problem all the key 180 milligram lines are great just go ahead and grab whatever flavor seems best for you I like the mint Irish cream and the dark chocolate tangerine the best but they're all incredible and they'll all get you [ __ ] up so this is a easy easy recommendation for me the key 180 milligram blackberry dark chocolate also spider-man homecoming it was a lot more fun than I thought it was gonna be so go see that too if you haven't seen it yet but I'm probably gonna be posting this like a

you might be able to find it in a couple large stores that maybe start with a W but nobody sells this stuff anymore it used to be available in the markets and the only place I can find it now is the Internet pick it up on the Amazon extra classic bubble they've got a whole bunch of different flavors I really should buy all the other flavors and try them the only thing is that when you buy it you get a whole bunch of gum and if you don't like a flavor you're probably gonna be chewing that flavor anyway for a couple months but that's okay this stuff is really good so I'm gonna be doing a review of the extra long lasting flavored classic bubble gum as I said I already get a review a couple months ago maybe six months ago when I bought the last batch for the patch before if you like my videos

views and it would just go wild with me maybe I'll get two views in a year that's not right the only way I can become famous as if you make me famous so my fame is in your hands my future is in your hands mmm delicious tasting okay we got a long ways to go Wrigley's I didn't know Wrigley's have made extra gum I thought it was just Extra gum rickly Wrigley's extra long lasting flavor classic bubblegum 15 sticks of sugarless gum and that's why I buy this I almost swallowed this gum just now that's my problem I buy gum ever since I was a kid I'd buy gum I chew it for five minutes then I swallow it and then I go for another stick at nighttime I like to chew gum and I drink ice water the problem with ice water was when the ice water hits the gum that makes it hard kind of hard to chew gum when it's hard so break it apart swallow it then I grab another piece that's why I go through so much gum please please please don't send me messages don't leave comments without swallowing gum we heard that when we were a kid if you swallow gum it's gonna stay in your stomach it's gonna be this huge ball of gum and somebody's gonna have to go operate to take it out well nothing stays in your body like that I don't have a if that was true I'd have a ball of gum the size of a little bowling ball right now so we've got something's not right here I thought I'd press the the timer to count down ten minutes I think what I did is I put in ten hours okay I was wondering what the heck's going on here why isn't this thing going down I'm trying to talk with my mouth not moving much so I can stay into the frame of the camera so I think we've gone for four minutes almost and I was rambling for about a minute before he did the timer so we've got five minutes on here we'll go for ten minutes of gum chewing so let me look at the package we have 15 sticks of gum I'll get back to sugarless in the middle you know 15 sticks of gum and we have 10 packages total of 156 sticks so why am i back to sugarless gum well I went down to store and I bought some gum well somebody just saw my video of hedgehogs that I just posted dog Hedgehog toys one time to the store and I bought some regular gum not really thinking about it went to the den well then I started doing the flossing at night I'm wondering what the world is wrong with my teeth I got all this tartar all this build-up where is it coming from I didn't have that before I went to the dentist dentists did a cleaning and said yeah you're right you got lots of buildup there I couldn't figure out why I went home thought about it I went no wonder I've been chewing this sugar gum this regular gum all day long so it's really like just having sugar saliva in your mouth and that grows tartar and bacteria and all that other stuff that's in there so I threw that gum out I went out and I bought what did I buy I bought this Wrigley's extra long lasting flavor OOP almost swallowed again it's almost like a natural reaction with me I bought the shirt of this gum and almost overnight I noticed that all that junk wasn't building up on my teeth anymore then when I had a cleaning and the last cleaning I asked her about it and she says yeah he did a lot better than the time before so what I've been doing now is I've been chewing gum has really get to chew it's good if it's sugarless chew gum it helps create and make more saliva more saliva breaks down the back helps break down the bacteria in your mouth and when you break that down you lessen or limit your gingivitis your gum disease so chewing gum after a meal is actually really good it's better if you're flossing you brush the chewing gum is a really good thing you just got to be careful you don't want to cause yourself TMJ problems and then have jaw problem it's so don't overdo it okay I do and I know it's really annoying when people I don't like what Pablo and Clark would like oh my god that's so obnoxious so you don't want to mom when I'm grabbing you don't want to open your mouth all clapping tromping did you WAIS you women do that on the street oh god this is so nasty what other problems do they have so nice thing about the extra bubblegum is it's got a beautiful flavor and it's got an even better smell so if you just ate a burger with onions you're not gonna get rid of the onion smell but you start you on that bubblegum and people go wow that's smells so good really good if you were taking dance classes you pop a stick of bubblegum you keep them in your shirt pocket pop a stick of bubblegum in there and while you're dancing all the women go oh you smell so good they don't notice if you smell really good from cologne or scented soaps but boy do they notice this classic bubblegum smell because it reminds everybody when they were a kid you got bubblegum when you were getting your hair cut got bubblegum when you were good and it just smells really good in the dance classes they get up to you and go oh oh my god you smell so good would you like to get married and then divorced so I can have your house just kidding that was a joke there so this stuff is really awesome what do we have we are at well more people are seeing my Hedgehog video bought the rescue dog you check out my channel you see the videos on rescue dogs and lots of other stuff that I did I have posted fix-it stuff food gum and put a video on there the rescue dog and I just bought her some Hedgehog toys so that's why you're hearing messages in the background so we are now at about stuff tastes so good after I shut off the video camera I'm gonna go get ice water turn this into a really hard piece of gum and then swallow it and that is why I have to buy the big case because I go through 150 sticks all the time so we are 49 seconds away from at least 10 minutes and as I said please do that thumbs up subscribe like if you want to donate you know the what I said earlier if there's a product you want me to review if I can get a hold of it I'll do a

Christie I'm a wellness consultant for the cannery west Henry West is a new dispensary in West Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles customers come in here with all sorts of different requests whether that be dietary requests or different methods of ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of my favorite edibles on the market right now feel free to come by the can we stop in and check them out yourself", "1e6yqV8W73c": "hi fam how you guys doing so today I'm gonna be doing another a just CBD gummy review so the funny part is guys I did a video um maybe a couple years ago I'm not exactly sure when I posted it but it got like 11,000 views and I so appreciate you guys watching but also if you could hit subscribe and like that would just be amazing so today I'm gonna be doing the just CBD gummies I got a thousand milligrams of the Sharpe gummies and thus our hearts and these come around every February for Valentine's Day so it's kind of a fun little limited edition whatever so for those of you who are new to my channel welcome thank you guys for tuning in so in my other video I kind of I rewatched it and I felt like I wasn't as prepared as I could have been so CBD for those of you who don't know cannabidiol CBD is a naturally occurring compound found in the resin flower of cannabis a plant with a rich history as a medicine going back a thousands of years both CBD and THC have significant therapeutic attributes but unlike THC CBD does not make a person feel stoned or intoxicated so CBD is for anxiety cramps period cramps headaches sleep I take them to help me with my sleep because sometimes I have insomnia and its really effective for me some people asked in my previous video if these have melatonin in them they do not have melatonin so if you guys are wondering that that's one question that I can answer for you no melatonin however something that I had mentioned in my previous video I'm not too thrilled because some of them do have red dye number four so some of them have other things that aren't like for instance gummy sharks they have artificial flavors so I'm not a huge fan of that just because it's not good for you it's like whatever chemicals however if they're effective then I try to wave that off so these are made in the USA their THC free so if you guys are stoners these are not going to get you high okay these are not gonna get you high you're not going to be stoned and there everyone has a different reaction a lot of the people commented on my video that they do it for anxiety a lot of people also mention that they didn't feel anything and I guess just like weed which this is not everyone has a different reaction so maybe you need to take more but this is made with hemp obviously it's a plant and yeah they have to keep reading it breed or eating its THC free because then people are gonna be like oh oh my god I didn't get high screw you guys oh my god wow these gummy sharks are kind of demented looking hmmm alright so with these ones here I had a long day I just came back from San Francisco so I wanted to put this video up for you guys cuz I got an email saying it was delivered so for the thousand milligrams it says to take one two three gummies every six hours as needed so just because it's a thousand milligrams doesn't mean it's a higher content it just means each gummy divided that by a thousand and it looks like there's set it on here well now I ripped the packaging I think I think it said approximately 68 pieces no come anyway and these sour hearts I'm gonna try one of these two the gummy sharks tastes really good um like I said in my previous video there's a little bit of an aftertaste but it's nothing to you know get upset about should I do the white what the pink or the white and the ones I got before were not sour they were just regular so let's give it a go my boyfriend love disease she eats them as candy honey I still have sugar in them dairy free fat free gluten free msg free that's good so I really do like these two and um I'm happy with my purchase so I used a promo code I got 20% off um I don't really know how it popped up I essentially was on the website just CBD calm and then I clicked out and I was like a different browser and then it was like don't leave yeah and then here's a 20% off coupon code so um and it was like all these different numbers if it Oh actually I think it might have been just 20 don't tell anyone but maybe give that a try so they're not inexpensive but they do come from a marijuana plant and they extract the the CBD from there so these two together were 16 free shipping and that was after the 20% off so it was originally gonna be 75 it's not cheap but I like to invest in my mental health and it really helps me with sleep and anxiety so I recommend it and as usual I will leave the link below and I will also leave the link to my original video and I hope you guys like it and thank you so much for the support and the love and please subscribe to my channel I so appreciate the support and as usual I will see you guys next time", "lLIW0yPRNdw": "family what is going on guys today on that we got the sour pouch I said pouch Sour Patch Kids berries sour then sweet artificially flavored of course Saudis at our 7-eleven thought I'd go ahead and pick them up in review on for the channel man [Music] boy oops oops oops oops let me check out the flavors oh I guess they don't have the flavors listed on the back I was expecting to turn it over and see the flavors but uh I don't see any I guess we're just gonna wing it I know you guys always wonder how many pieces do you actually get in here this is in 4k by the way is it random oh I thought about come out 5 5 5 and 5 but no so we got three of these I mean four of these strawberries looking once we got six of these raspberry looking ones five of these blueberry looking ones and five of those grape looking ones which one shall we try first I think I'm gonna go with the blue mmm I taste the berry you know one thing myself matches these days they're not sour at all back in the day they were sour nowadays they taste sweet they don't know where's the sour where is the no you you know you wrinkle your face over yet ANS sour these are not even sour that's good that's like I own I want to say it's like a blue raspberry it's good though let's see what this is first I thought was a watermelon didn't kind of moved over to like him I mean I'm gonna describe him like a strawberry I can't describe what flavour it says but it's good go to these great looking ones this is like a great raspberry if that makes any sense you get a deep great taste with Dennis like esta berries it's the berries these are very good I'm the last one probably least favorite out of them the flavor didn't really hit you as hard I was in the other three this was kind of like light I can't even pinpoint the flavor on this I wish they would've had to describe the flavors on him dropping the ball sour patch what you don't say yeah these red ones our least favorite my favorite you can see is going which I had the least of that's usually what happens in when you had a favorite flavor you usually have the least of it in the pack so whatever that strawberry or the melon berry taste on candies worm that wasn't my favorite second I'm gonna go with D stir them ago T's and then I told you the least favorite these are good as I said these are not sour at all but they're sweet this is like it's a sugar on it like already are they trying but you think sour anymore or what I don't easily be showers or a baby man it's really pathetic sour patch what are y'all doing but definitely definitely go try these out these may be my new fit my new favorite sour patch sour packs berries these are good go try them out I'm gonna get these a nine point five out of ten mmm this is good too I got one flavor was just a little bit better there's probably a perfect 10 mm a demo pack definitely picking these up much more now when I go into the convenience store I'm again I'm not am hit that thumbs up for another review sour patch kids berries nine point five days are great just banging or try them out we out peace [Music]", "KOtZ3v8t3s8": "plus five and everybody boys I hope my neighbors are at home but I'm sure that they are boy we finally get late in today's video I feel so awkward right now I don't know why but welcome back to video hope you guys are having an amazing day today and if not I hope my video is able to make your day a little bit brighter I'm super duper excited for today's video I not only have half a blind I'm so butthurt you guys I have shout out to King palms send me more because I thought that I was too cool for school and that I didn't like hemp blunts and that I only like tobacco blunts but after smoking so many tobacco blunts and getting like headaches I [ __ ] with the king poems and so I try to like stuff it and I had it ready and when I was walking out here to set up my little filming it broke in half like literally in half so lively and as type [ __ ] I got a little Roach first a smoke and then I also got a bomb muhfucka a drink this is so refreshing you already know I got that double cup because honey Google today is a multiple game for toy edible loot bag video oh yes we've heard it here part two part two the first thing I pulled out is this rice krispies treat this is what it looks like I don't think the cameras focusing on it but looks like this this is one of my favorite edible but I feel like rice krispie treats and like treats like this like cereal bars I feel like they never hit me awhile back I went to dabba thon and I bought a 400 milligram at a bowl and it really didn't do much to me so yeah I have eaten this before in a my part 1 video but it was by a different brand I like to try all kinds of different brands and none of them seem to hit me too well but they're super super tasty so if you're more in it for the taste these are both then I got some soft beat thugs I never tried this brown before so I'm SuperDuper excited I love trying new brands of all kinds of different things and especially freaking edibles so in my part 1 video I had some different brand of chips so where is pretty much the same thing wheat hot cheetos and these have a hundred and fifty milligrams in this whole bag this has 500 milligrams so you got a great fight I also got oh my gosh I am so excited for this you guys these are sour belts candies and I love blue raspberry like flavored candies like airheads the blue but skittles the blade skittles is a happening but like anything blue and this is blue so I'm really I'm really stoked and I've heard from a lot of people that these were really really bomb so they hyped me up they hyped me up when I went to go get this stuff I was hyped up to try this because I guess you only eat one or two strips and you get super high but I have a high tolerance so honey a 300 milligram one or two bites is not gonna do me justice but if it tastes bomb I'm with the ships and then this is more my style you already know we might beat us this is a freaking la lucha that lon mmm okay so I really want you to this like right now okay I also got for the last but not least you guys oh by the way this has a hundred and ten milligrams so a little bit over 100 milligrams my everything really so last time we did a lemonade edible for the drink in the first new thing and then for this time I really needed to freakin go in with the 1200 milligram THC syrup because I've tried to CV syrup I've tried codeine I tried it all you know and I even tried filming a video trying this but in the fruit punch flavor and YouTube decided to delete my video so you know LBD famine stoppable honey and I came back with a great flavor so when I went to the dispensary and they had grave I was like put back on my shopping list cuz I gotta try so I'm really hyped up for this honestly like I'm pretty pretty pretty pretty hyped it's 1,200 milligrams this is the most potent edible I've ever seen on the market and that I've ever consumed you guys have seen probably my previous videos of me eating a thousand milligrams brownies trying to do my makeup and all kinds of different things and I really am NOT a fan of brownies and you know I like the rice krispies treats but they just don't hit me as hard you know sour belts are bomb but I usually like little gummies or something but something like there's like a beverage gets you so [ __ ] up you guys if you ever want to try any of one of these edibles please try the syrup do yourself favorite so I'm just gonna hop right in by mixing up our syrup because I'm just so hyped so I have my double cup my my sprite with my sprite and yeah oh actually I'm gonna take a thumbnail damn taking it thumbnails kind of hard okey-dokey well I literally could wake up the whole neighborhood anyways step yeah just so you guys know like what time it is it is 12:30 exactamente 12:30 exactly so let's see how long it takes for these edibles to hit why don't we first gotta you know consumed that no mm-hmm so I have this syrup I'm gonna just shake it because I bet you it's been sitting for a minute make sure you shake that hole nice and dandy Wow look at the cap it looks like th season there alright I'm gonna show you guys up close personality wait it off when you have no groups and you don't want a nip slip it's kind of a brown I wish it was a prettier shade okay so I used a lot I don't know if I'm gonna like this one I'm licking the syrup and taste a great I don't know okay so a lot of people like to come at me like dest you swear like you're sipping lean Jaime its [ __ ] syrup same base okay therefore you're supposed to make like I want my [ __ ] to be mixed honey mixed Loki I'm making a mess [Applause] pretty mother [ __ ] bomb I can literally see the THC in my soda like it kind of looks green like if I wish you guys could see it but it literally looks like wax on my ice it looks good though it doesn't look like what the [ __ ] is in my cup it looks like ooh that's bad again me so so far so good you guys I would give this syrup a 10 out of 10 if I had to pick one edible that's like my favorite edible technically it would be the syrup because [ __ ] bring your spray whether you're going to [ __ ] Six Flags [ __ ] Disneyland like no I'm just kidding I don't know if you're a lot of bringing drinks to Disney but sticks legs I know you're allowed to bring your own drinks honey so best believe I'm putting this in like a little canister my hydro flask I actually just recently ordered a hydro flask for college and I guess I have a six like season pass so if any of you guys are trying to go please hit me up cuz I ain't got no homies to go with and I'm fine I bring this Sara you know pour up and a hydro guess you popular okay um I don't know should I smoke or should I eat the rest of the edibles this is a mute thing I guess I should just use edibles you know I have to try that you guys I I've been dying to try these hot cheetos like I said I've tried different brands and other Browns were bombed on fire so let's see if this Alito's friends compares hmm ooh smells like like a [ __ ] spicy cheese ball with a little bit of weed it doesn't really smell like weed though that's what it looks like got a [ __ ] hot cheeto this [ __ ] looks like our normal hot cheeto it tastes just like the other ones hmm these ones were a little bit cheaper cuz the other ones I tried were 300 milligrams these are only 150 milligrams so less potency the artist Lee is still super bomb hmm smoking a blunt eating your chips and then sipping your [ __ ] lien just kidding tasty syrup it doesn't get better than this you guys like Yuki a highest [ __ ] by sipping this this tastes so good it tastes like a grape flavored sprite I love it I kind of want to add more syrup you added to do it just so I could be like really [ __ ] up you killed me cuz this is 1,200 milligrams like the big if I wouldn't take any of the other edibles and I just drank this I would be dead I would be dead but the fact that I'm eating this and I'm eating edibles like Wow I never even added up the amount of milligrams that I'm consuming but let's see 150 the syrup is 1200 I probably won't drink the entire bottle of syrup because I want to mix it also in this sprite I'm going to a family party later at a pool best believe I won't be chilling by the pool with my sprite so later I'm gonna finish the rest of that but right now I'm putting like just the perfect amount I actually added a lot more so I'm gonna mix it so 1213 50 and then the rice krispies is 500 milligrams so B 1850 and then the sour belts these are three hundred so that'll be 2150 yeah and then this is a hundred and ten oh my gosh oh honey wait twenty one fifty plus one ten twenty one fifty plus one and 21 carry the one twenty to sixty right I'm already feeling it now I'm just getting back right am i right I believe it's around 20 160 so 2,000 160 milligrams that's insane other thing mmm and these chips are so bomb if you guys like to medicate but like microdose EPS look like a sandwich and you'll be chillin won't I'm obsessed with these chips homie bomb but else is gonna say oh yeah somebody tried commenting in my other neat thing video saying that Oh a thousand milligrams ain't [ __ ] that's equivalent to one gram honey honey honey let me just sit my soda these are spicy I got the extra flamin hot ones they had regular hot ones and I got the extra hot superbomb um honey what the [ __ ] you talking about 100 1000 milligrams is one gram I'm not trying to call you out or anything much love to you but you have nothing but good intentions but that's just insane hundred milligrams is equivalent to one grab so eating a 100 milligram edible like this most likely since its 110 they used about a gram and a half maybe probably less than that excuse me they probably used about a gram to make this to make this now they used a hundred grams to make it a thousand milligrams but it's actually more than a thousand to this 1200 so there's more than that for this 300 milligram edible it's around 3 grams do you feel me you feel what I'm feeling so yeah 500 about 5 grams so as a human as a [ __ ] Union who smokes every [ __ ] day you know once I get to the first second balloon I'll be chilling so it's about 4 grams in you know the third blender mice so that's around five grams of weed so evening around 500 milligrams of an edible will get me pretty chilling but like I said the Rice Krispies don't usually hit me but that's why it 100 milligram edibles don't really hit me because if I only smoke one blood one gram I'm not gonna get that high cuz I have a high tolerance but for someone who never smokes and eats even 20 milligrams of an edible will be super fun but you know it's not always about the number it's kind of about well what's your what's your past like what's your what's your tolerance like have you tried edibles before did you smoke a lot but you've never tried edibles like yeah oh okay so I'm trying to open these and I'm super excited to try these these are the styler belts damn if I can even open it wrong it smells like cotton candy let's try it I know that flavour rx makes some like these I mean my sister tried I may really like them hmm sour I don't like sour candy but I did it for the bike for the milk bank drop them on the floor five-second rule hello wrong number wrong number the [ __ ] why you calling my phone yeah so I was told that if you eat one or two of these you'll be [ __ ] up so I'm kind of gonna save them so I can eat one or two and see if I get [ __ ] up but today I just wanted to try them out and they're pretty bomb you guys like they don't taste like weed at all none of these edibles so far it tastes like weed I hate edibles that tastes like weed I've gotten hate in my past videos where I eat the 1000 milligram brownie because people are like why are you gagging so much like it's not even that bad the honey of course you're not gonna [ __ ] know because you ain't the one eating it but when I was eating it it tasted like I was eating weed and that [ __ ] tastes bad you know this it tastes like I'm eating a [ __ ] airheads and I get high smoke it was so that shit's pretty tight same with the chips it tastes like regular hot cheetos you know it doesn't taste like I'm eating them a nug so I feel like that's really important when it comes to edibles it's just like at least for me personally is like one is it gonna get me [ __ ] up - is it gonna taste like [ __ ] cuz I don't care if it gets me [ __ ] up if it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] and I don't care if they taste bomb if it doesn't get me [ __ ] up you know that's again [ __ ] up so this is the little logic become behind the life beam des and me picking my edibles knees are pretty bummed I like the blueberry I like the flavor it doesn't taste like weed aiyo there's a little hit of an aftertaste but not really stay what's on my Cheetos you know like you're gonna get those little aftertaste but it's not bad at all if I could tolerate it you could part ollar a because I have a really bad like if it tastes like weed I won't eat it I'll give it away straight up and that's right today I didn't buy any brownies because brownies and cookies no matter what Brad how potent it is you know I've eaten the thousand milligram IV the 100 milligrams from the best friends from kirova to enjoyable - lol edibles like I tried it all and I'm just not a fan of the cookies and brownies especially because when you make a fresh batch of cookies at home how long do those cookies taste bomb for you guys for the first [ __ ] five minutes that those cookies come out the oven after 5 minutes those cookies taste like hard [ __ ] breaks and they're not bomb same with the [ __ ] edibles they're gonna have it in the refrigerator for months weeks months years and then you're eating it and it's hard and it's just it's not like a fresh bomb [ __ ] cookie so until I find a company who makes a bomb cookie that's like super potent I'm gonna stay away from the baked goods I really like these though these are really really really good really good and I'm not a fan of sour candy I'm not a fan of candy I have a sweet tooth too but I have it in a way where like I crave hot cheetos I'm not one to crave chocolate or sour candy and like skills like every time I go to the gas station I don't buy candy I buy water and chips super spicy chips and water so I don't I don't pass out I want to spark my blood already but I still have two more edibles to try freeze so I'm gonna try this one I'm super excited for this one this says Tama reand oh so this is a tambourine dough you guys if I ever have a me angry I'm gonna have a pinata and it's gonna be filled of these you know let's give it a gander my shirts already [ __ ] up this should taste like [ __ ] there's like a bunch of the product in the cap like that's already my 50 milligrams right there homie the [ __ ] this edible is too messy honestly it's not even that it tastes bad it's just that it's so hard to eat pbbbbbt I remember being little and thinking that was so fun to like push up these like normal candy I says it has sugar chili THC extract caramel citric acid I'm an enol egg corn product that's so weird I don't like it I'm kind of like like I don't know it's kind of like when you think about it it's like yeah like caramel and like what else did you see corn acid the [ __ ] Beach I bought this for you guys honestly I thought that maybe you guys would want to see it and it was like unique and it was cheap so 300 milligrams but honestly I don't really [ __ ] with it I wouldn't buy this to be like Tiki I wanna get high like no [ __ ] I'd rather just buy a topic rather by the sour Bell just cuz that's so much easier to eat like this it's already coming out from like the bottom right here it's all over the cap okay you guys have one more edible to try and that is this Wow crisps fruit [ __ ] so it looks like this I tried all kinds of different brands of the same Mountain milligrams oh I guess smell the weed I get smelly smells beautiful these are my favorite he's like if I can eat this every day I would Bob this is pretty bomb I really do like it it tastes a little bit like weed though out of all the edibles here I think this one smells the most like eat and taste the most like lead so really full all right you guys honestly [ __ ] the [ __ ] my camera just stopped recording for some random ass reason probably cuz I'm taking too damn long but let us spark my roach I haven't smoked all day and I honestly do love smoking obviously do love smoking but like I'm not an addict no but like you know you could eat edibles all day you know get high as [ __ ] whatever whatever but I like smoking like I like smoking my ganja and chillin so we finally get turned up on the life being dead you kill me I know you do wait I think I was imminent just to get to the big bucks ain't got no bad intentions just occupation I don't know how to so I'm gonna go do something productive like that but I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna take a little bite of everything before I go whoa first book is 10 o'clock so I'll be back at 10:30 and then it would be like an official power ok maybe at like little past we'll see yeah it's so [ __ ] saying hey I really want to go to sleep like I feel so [ __ ] tired I just I probably look all like dead right now but um I have two little Tommy Party and I looked at the address you days and it's so far cuz I live far you know and make family looks like so it's like far it's like driving on ago they do we owe you no honey there are red ants there are red ants [ __ ] girl and um I'm just gonna say that I'm high as [ __ ] and I'm really scared to get bit by rhythms which love for me to you guys every day and really cool a bit stay low stay obviously positive so if if dad told me okay in case you guys I swear everything you I got it look cute but now show me myself my dog I feel um I guess a lot I can't because it's called my block camera he's like [ __ ] lost the battery that was traveling so I said it was a camera but that's the battery charger so I'm just you see that physical account it is a literally 8 very right now it's 8:31 it's a while I've just been sleeping all day you guys I didn't go hello [ __ ] family party I [ __ ] slept I wasted a [ __ ] brand-new pair of eyelashes I don't know how to feel about it but my family just pulled up so I'm gonna go before this gets awkward so will these guys be sure to thumbs up the video if you guys liked it and I majored a little bit brighter [Music]", "G_jmMfjsKtw": "hi everyone so today is Sunday and it's a pretty boring day today I don't really have much to do today I have some housework but nothing like you know major that I have to do and it's cold I think he got down to like 0 last night it's cold here this morning I'm just gonna have my my tea and I'm going to be doing a review on the twisted extracts cherry jelly bomb cooking green bastards style sent this to me I never had this before so I'm excited it's uh it's 80 milligram THC and it's a sativa so that should just it should just be fine I shouldn't be you know tired I'm hoping I'm not probably not anyways let's open this up you can really smell the cherry oh my goodness okay so it [Music] so it looks like like this it comes in this type of thing and it looks like a Lego so I guess each um because it says eight eight by ten milligram doses so I guess each little round thing here is ten milligrams it smells it smells like cherry but it smells like um like the 1980s like the Cabbage Patch Kid when you first gotta go with that that could smell it had that but plastic I was just telling ed about this the other day about plastic smelling things it was like just a smell that came off the plastic anyways let's uh okay it smells like cherry it doesn't taste like cherry you could taste the THC in it I'm sorry but odors doesn't taste good like I thought the stuff from Dana bhisma was strong well this is really strong good thing I brought a drink that's tapas hole and it leaves like an after taste in your mouth wowsers okay so I will come back when I feel something I don't know how long it's gonna take probably not that long because I should have probably had something to eat like a toast or something cuz I only have tea in me so I'm just I should have maybe read the directions first but it just says um yeah you know it's eight doses we recommend first-time users which I'm not allow 60 to nine minutes for 60 to 90 minutes for effect before another dose is considered well I just took the whole thing so let's try the 60 to 90 yeah that's that's it there maybe I'll get a lot of housework done in no time after it kicks in who knows anyways I'm going to finish drinking my tea and I have bedding to do today and some other things so I will come back when I have let you guys know when this kicks in what I'm feeling all the good stuff okay so um because I didn't think through my date properly and I reached out the edible I am walking to the Metro if I need to pick up some stuff and I cannot drive now and it can't drive so this is going to be the experience I [Music] feel something I just don't know what it is yet so you know Azusa kicks in I will turn this on and let you know okay way back hey um the [ __ ] has ever started to kick in and this is probably not the best idea but I'm like not far I'm not far to go I just need to get there get the [ __ ] but I don't know my eyes really feel like they're high okay so like I think I'm gonna probably call ahead just so I don't feel so um edgy I guess okay I get closer when I get to the match our Altos heart because they should this is not good okay I'm just gonna at the match room and I'm pretty worried this this [ __ ] here just keeps kicking in stronger lighter for Edie I'm gonna do that now and then I'll show you inside Metro okay leave the grocery store and I feel like everybody is looking I'm getting a little bit paranoid here it's just like I don't even have anybody quick wheeze though the struggle is real I don't know what to do and it's just a wave okay I'm just going to get the theme so they need to get it and then I will come back after I hurry up in here and get outside experience I just really need to make it home and it seems like it's so far away [Music] lazy like my arm is gonna bust before I make it that but stuff there that cooking green bastard style sent me it's given it I like you know I like it a little bit paranoid like with the whole grocery store thing but like now that I'm I'm home I'm okay I'm not feeling tired I'm feeling it's kind of relaxed and when I rolled up the joint so I'm gonna smoke that like you feel relaxed and you feel like does not let you feel lazy you just feel like doing easy tasks there's just seen Charlie he's like looking at something over there now what but you're a you just feel like not really doing much I don't know what's going on with this the the twisted extracts that jelly bomb it's good it smells like you know it's a cherry but I will be honest the taste is horrible it kicked in roughly like and like an hourish thanks what is that guy's name cooking that cooking is a cooking green bastard style [Music] so thanks cooking green bastard style I'm not feeling too hungry or anything like that like I kind of like this stuff would be good to do I like on a really nice fall day when there's lots of leaves all over the place and you're just like in the bush like in the trail or something like that like when you know how many people are around right like this stuff would be good I think you would like I would like it I'd like to go walk on a trail and when there's more leaves mmm that's what I learned to talk about okay well the leaf thing I just on my way home there was some like really nice red maple leaves that's we're on the sidewalk and I was like I just thought it was really pretty but in the Metro everybody was looking at me like everybody and by the time I got to the cash like the cashier I didn't even make eye contact with her I just saw debit and Jetley when she was I guess meaningful I wanted a bag I just kept my head down so yeah there's some paranoia with it and I'm just gonna finish this and get on with my day so it's like that's it that's all bye", "SauwbC3GG-w": "hey what's good YouTube it's your boy mad me in 24 today I got a taste past sneaky Stardust from bad 19 Mickey Stardust makes throwing back a handful of powder a tree since in a few moments at shape-shifts into chewing gum that's surprisingly sour and super tasty the interesting textural transformation will make you go whooo while the satisfyingly sour flavor will make you go hmm and even though it's kind of gross to watch somebody chew gum we're going to do this anyway since the transformation is so amazing so apparently this is gum it starts off as a powder listen to that it starts off at the powder and then as you chew it it turns into gum I don't know how that works or what kind of crazy physics are behind that but I'm super excited and don't mind the Thunder booming outside I can't get this ladle I can't get this thing off it's got the smallest thing possible and I'm just gonna poke a hole through it yeah that's not working you know the next best thing when in doubt stab it out I can either start it smells a lot like blue raspberry because that is the flavor of course I don't know what to think of that it kind of smells like a pixie stick almost I mean I really haven't had anything like this before and I'm a little nervous because they say it's kind of sour okay I got most of the label off and most is good enough for me so yeah let's do this I'm at me in 24 I'm about to enter the sour zone with sneaky star dust oh wow I got some shower who likes pretty good oh it's really good okay starting in the gum that is really good first of all trace like a pixie stick now starting to get a little sweet kind of like sour pad it starts I was like I'm like a pixie stick then it turned into like a sour patch thing almost sour and sweet old sour is still sticking around but it has definitely turned to go there it is a little weird how the powder kind of just like turned into gum almost like it might just be like a bunch of dried out gum chopped into very little pieces I mean maybe but whatever it is it's pretty good sneaky star dust is definitely on my list of favorite candies now that is pretty good and don't you go saying that candy isn't a gun because candy still technically falls into the gum candy category and it is delicious so thank you again vat19 for including this in my mysterious box of mystery and remember keep it real hugs not drugs remember to wash your hands since we're still in coronavirus and i will see you guys next time", "ItEPM18TO2o": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to a new seasonal Edition extra gums this is the strawberry swirl and then I also have confetti cake pop and I bought both of these at the Dollar Tree they were a dollar each I think yeah they weren't they were a dollar each you get 15 sticks in each package and I've already I took the cellophane wrapping off because it was it's hard to do in the car and you might wonder how do i review gum I would and the world would you review gun well I don't know how other people do it because I've never seen anyone review go but the way I do it is Kevin and I'm I like to do it when we're going to get out because that way I can put a piece in my mouth and then I go about my day and I can see how good the flavor is how long it lasts and is it worth getting again and I have found some of these seasonal flavors are really good I think I had some pumpkin spice the extra that I liked medical love so much that I would get again the only the only seasonal gum that I've had so far that I would get over and over it's actually Trident lighters that it was the candy cane and Ashley and I get it every year and it's just a good strong candy cane flavor and it lasts a while it's well worth the money so I think first we will try the confetti cake pop and I'm gonna get some peace out and we'll tell you I'll show you how it looks and please together it looks like a piece of birthday cake AHA Mona for you it's kind of hard to open it in the car but this is just how I choose to do it and it's probably hard to see it looks like like it reminds me of the Ben and Jerry's ice cream the birthday cake ice cream we think about the place okay it's kind of hard when you first put in yeah it's hard give it a soft a good fight very vanilla cake yes I'll tell you what though almost like a white chocolate it's not XEL the teeth when you virtually know something it does I agree then this have a good vanilla cake flavor almost the most I'm putting so it's 11:30 now and we're just been in our mouth so we'll let you know how long it was okay so it's been 15 minutes and this gum is pretty much running its course it's still come on still has a little flavor on it but it's certain to get harder to wear it's not enjoyable to chew it anymore so yeah it does hurt you jaws so I'm gonna spit it out that was good I don't know that I would buy another pack of metallic you wouldn't I think I would get very very very tired of that flavor all the time because when I buy a pack of gum I go through the whole pot before I switch to a new pack I don't keep several in my purse so I do think I would get tired of that one so next we're gonna try in the strawberry swirl so let us spit these out and then we'll put the them little openings okay now we are going to try the strawberry swirl and I took pictures there be pictures at the end we gave our mouth a little rest after the cupcake so that flavor spoke German so these are five colors I did not there are five calories each usually there's a less than that one the exercise 5 it smells strong put this paper in my pocket 12:45 it's 12:45 he's in case you couldn't under like the fire that it has a very very strong strawberry smell there's something else though but it's an artificial yeah it's an artificial strawberry I'll keep it on out don't like Kevin I'll keep isn't in his mouth okay so it's 12:45 we'll see how long it lasts okay it is 107 and I'm getting ready to take this gum out Kevin took his out about six seven minutes ago he did not like it from the get-go though you didn't like the flavor at all I'm out of the two they see we're different because out of the - I like the strawberry better because the flavor was so so so strong and when I have gum yeah you admit it we're strong so when I have gum I like something that's gonna be strong you know that usually I'm using it to wet my mouth but also to help with get my breath fresher you know so that strawberry Kevin oh god sorry we're driving okay my hardest ketchup so I like the strawberry better I would not get either one again though because they do this bring and extra and I know I said this on my last review this brand is harder than the Trident layers I don't know what it is but it's just a harder friggin jaws hurt yes it does it makes your jaw hurt to it where the Trident layers you have to chew that for hours before that so they're good Kevin like the cake I like the strawberry but we won't get them again so I hope you enjoyed this on the go gum review so thanks for watching", "woybDqonW5E": "I'm having issues with my hair so sorry I was over here trying to do stuff with it and like nothing I can't get it to stay anyway I want it to so and it's getting on my nerves so yeah I need to straighten that anyway so want to let you guys know about the CBD stuff okay so it works it doesn't work like smoking weed it doesn't work like THC you know so it's a different effect but I feel it and what I mean by that is it isn't like some kind of chemical weirdness or whatever it is actually where I feel calm it's like a subtle calm and it's like my my brain like my thoughts and stuff like are very calm it's like all of the overthinking all the racing thoughts all of that has gone away I even went to Chipotle like thirty minutes ago and it was busy as heck the lines were wrapped around my passed the door all that stuff and usually when I go into Chipotle and it's like that or any time really I started getting anxiety and I start freaking out I'm like hurry I want to hurry and get out of there you know as fast as I can and this time it didn't affect me I stayed in line everything and it was perfectly fine so what I'm saying is this the CBD sorry the CVD works amazingly well so it just calms you and like all my symptoms of anxiety and stuff are like they went away too and so I'm hoping I really need to get my hair on my face no uh so what I'm saying is I would definitely do see video oil I was asked in the last video with the different okay CBD oil first of all is an all-natural product I am NOT against I'm against man-made medication I'm against prescription drugs things like that of that nature you know I am NOT against all natural stuff that's how I heal I'm an all natural healer that's what I'm used to that's what I do even with my kids wait I don't vaccinate my kids first of all and we're not gonna go on to that I'm not gonna get into some kind debate with you guys but I don't fascinate my kids everything we do healing wise is 100% natural my kids have had the flu before and I feel them naturally I don't there's no medication no antibiotics under that crap so that's what I mean like using natural stuff from the earth and so we need help is actually all natural cannabis is all natural so I don't feel I feel like that's amazing and CBD oil is a form it's a chemical taken from the marijuana plant but it's not THC that's gonna get you like all high and crazy right so there's actually see whatever dude I don't know I'm just trying to tell you guys I love how it's making me feel I do feel more focused and I do feel like I can more normal more down-to-earth more grounded and more the anxiety isn't affecting me and all that so I am loving this like I really and truly am and so I believe this is just my opinion that you guys should try and I just did a 25 milligram gummy that's all I did and so and I like it I really I really enjoyed this I'm really enjoying this like I'm probably gonna go back and get more because I like

is a rainbow from Jolly Rancher soda Wow I can't wait to never drink these yeah these cannot be touched for any reason nope it's like you have the Power Rangers bottled up over there there's a rainbow of whimsy Tom when we saw this ah I'm gonna keep these forever and then I'm like ATM to be rich oh my goodness I know how many are there in there I think that is I think that's it I wouldn't get the mystery flavor no I'm oh my goodness I'll get the guys flavor oh jeez Louise what wondered how soda would arrive that you ordered them I've often wondered that myself and now I know so individually you have to show up all these uh permutations of Jolly Rancher soda first here we got orange and it's pink so just like oranges it looks like a grapefruit that's how oranges are we've got a blue raspberry oh and yes he's pretty tame looks like a looks like that blue cream so today you find like on the border Tennessee okay you know look looks pretty dude decent I would say let's see who we got green apple your standard standard fruit soda fair I guess okay a little bit more than subversive side of things and here we got watermelon a little bit of very rare to see watermelon soda yes very rare outside a big cave but here we have it was good these are all twenty these are all twenty ounce bottles by the way yeah these will last you awhile standard size and this is grape and the grapes look like like with grapes it's nice nice vector art oh nice a nice craft that looks very much a helmet 99 eggs also yes this is the this is the sequel to Fruitopia yes and we have peach a little bit more on the L secure side of things very posh all : yeah yeah very pints all very very nature you know what am I gonna say here we've got cherry flavor that's also probably a little bit what you would expect for Jolly Rancher Soto it's pretty good it's like a cough syrup or like children and also for something like that so here we have the entire lineup of Jolly Rancher soda in one room yes I can feel the power I'm probably I'm gonna I'm keeping this forever now Wow now my question is are these different colors I'm gonna say anise that's that's a tough call clearly I would say that the orange is a deeper or just more now this is more of an antihistamine I should know this is more of a this is more of a pencil and this is more of an antihistamine I think the orange is more of an amber color yeah - the more aubergine yes well I think there's only one thing we can do now yes they have to mix all these together and see what happened oh I'm P I'm gonna get dis my case okay if I plant us to display them all but let's talk about my rainbow here you own the color here alright we are so gonna get robbed oh yeah how people know we have this that one guy who just likes all

check out the Jolly Rancher gummies and original flavors keep watching and you learn more about you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey it's Lucky Penny shop and it's time for another us a candy it is the Jolly Ranchers gummies these are the original flavors grape cherry green apple orange watermelon lemon it looks like they're in fruit flavor shapes let me flip it around here that way not sure where when we got these I didn't even realize it was a Hershey company product either Jolly Rancher gummies but as I started this video I said to myself it's time it's time I finally do a maker set that goes right in line with these now it's not gonna happen in this video because I want to try these and then I'm gonna come back and do this it's the easy to make Jolly Rancher gummy pops maker kit we also have a bonus refill so I'm sure to have enough mixes for it and we're going to give it a shot now when this video comes out it'll be after this one of course and then I'll probably save some of these and bring them back into that video why not so let's get this out of the way kind of excited to get to that one finally and this is spurring the odd to do it it's always fun to do a new maker so now I have to do it because I publicly said I'm going to do it so in the comments you can say Dave you said you were gonna do it I know I will get to it I like doing new makers and this just helps me focus on that maker how about that okay here we go that's the whole bag let's check out the flavors so we have grape and we have what is that watermelon and the lemon that one's easy to pick out lemon and what's this one oh that's the grape the green one is green apple and then an orange and I have to say the shapes on them are pretty decent compared to some recent ones that we've done I think I have to lay them all down let me lay them all down in a tight little group and take a look at us so one two three four five one two three Oh cherry I know I know I know I know when I make a mistake everybody's saying you forgot cherry you forgot cherry ding ding ding Dini I wish it was a buzzer see if you had a buzzer that every time I was about to make some type of error you could just zap me hmm and then I know oops okay I'm gonna say nice array of gummies let me try I would try I don't know for some reason to orange let's just see now when I bite a gummy I always check to see if it's an easy bite or a hard bite meaning sometimes you can go right through it like a piece of fruit but other times you're chewing it like a piece of steak so let's see these are like a piece of steak it's a harder chewy or gummy but a burst of flavor that orange was super tasty hmm look at that when I missed that one its square it says jr. on it I didn't know there was gonna be a bonus shape look at that that's cool I think I want to do the watermelon hooters a yellow one - so there's square ones in there interesting I guess as you start picking and poking around and they each hmm they don't look like they have the same design all right and after that watermelon I'm gonna taste the water now you know the Jolly Roger ROG rant Roger you know the Jolly Rogers the hard candy watermelon tastes exactly like that as soon as I bend I thought ooh that tastes just like a Jolly Rancher so if you're a Jolly Rancher fan and that's your favorite flavor you can like these gummies I just ate the lemon one super tasty these are good all right so don't forget you can't comment in the comments you know do the maker and it will show up now usually on Mondays we have new

cattle rancher um you get that like watermelon sweetness at the beginning a little bit of that that's tangy sourness um you have another simple don't do that on the bubbles um there is a bit of a

ordered some here's the box it's called blue razz blue razz delta 8 thc he said it would help me relax take the edge off so i thought i'd give it a try since i usually use kratom or cbd oil but this time i'm going to try these and this is what they look like so they're like little gummies little blue squares well let's give it a shot it tastes okay a little bit bitter i guess that's why they sweeten it the hemp is a little bit bitter so they add a little bit of sweetener in there make it taste a little bit better anyway we'll uh we'll see what happens about 10-15 minutes he said it should kick in delta 8 thc is now the most exciting and most intoxicating product in the hemp industry now that you're seeing it everywhere you might be wondering what all the hype is about traditional marijuana use is often associated with drug addiction and legal issues as a result cannabis curious consumers look for an alternative delta 8 thc is fast becoming that alternative delta 9 thc is the compound in cannabis that makes you high its close cousin delta 8 is slightly different chemically but does provide some of the same effects delta 8 thc is one of hundreds of cannabinoids found in cannabis just like other cannabinoids delta 8 interacts with the body's nervous system and provides different health benefits delta 8 is derived from hemp and contains less than 0.3 percent delta 9 which keeps it legal in the us yet the government could change its mind at any time many delta 8 thc users refer to it as marijuana light when consumed delta 8 helps you relax and relieve stress it can reduce feelings of anxiety and depression many find relief from pain and sleeplessness after using delta eight delta eight thc has some psychoactive effects but not nearly as intense as delta nine some users describe the buzz from delta 8 as smooth without the paranoia delta 8 thc can help deal with daily life without the unnecessary fear or stigma that comes with marijuana smoking everyone is different and effects will vary yet so far people are getting positive results however be warned you will fail a drug test after consuming delta hthc if a drug test is required by your job or for any other reason it may be best to skip delta eight the most popular form of delta eight as gummies delta eight gummies are sweetened and flavored to lessen the bitter taste associated with hemp vape pens are also very common so if you are curious about the effects of cannabis but reluctant or unable to smoke it delta 8 might be in your future search for a reputable retailer online and give it a try well it's been about 10 minutes since i took the delta 8 blue razz gummies and i have to say that it does definitely have an effect they i feel a lot a lot lighter you know a lot lighter maybe light-headed a little bit definitely got a little bit of a buzz and i feel relaxed i feel like i can just sit and not not have a care in the world so i have to say i recommend the blue razz the blue

turn, there is someone talking\nabout CBD right now. The hard part is when you're looking at the\neffects of CBD on the body, there's only so much that can really be talked about. You see, there's a lot of censorship because\nit's so close to Cannabis, it's very difficult to talk about CBD. So, what I wanted to do in this video is I\nwanted to break down the science of how it truly works in your body. I want to do this because I feel like there's\na lot of misinformation out there, and I also feel like we need to understand that endocannabinoid\nreceptors in our body are a natural thing, and endocannabinoids are a natural thing that\nare existing in our body. So in this video, what you're going to see\nis ultimately an overview, an overview of what happens inside the body with endocannabinoids\nwith different adenosine receptors, with different serotonin receptors, glutamate, dopamine,\nall the things that actually make your body go around when it comes down to endocannabinoids. So first off, what we have to talk about is\nwhat exactly is CBD? All right. CBD is the non-psychoactive component of cannabis. So CBD oil is usually extracted, and it's\nthe component that doesn't have an effect like THC. So, it works on different receptors within\nthe body. Most of us know this by now because we see\ninfluencers all over the place talking about CBD, and they're all acting like crazy experts. The thing is is it goes a lot deeper than\nthe fact that it's just not THC. Okay? There's a lot that goes on in the body. So, how exactly do these endocannabinoid receptors\nwork within the body? See, we have two different receptors. We have CB1 and CB2, and these are all throughout\nthe body. They're not just in the brain. They're not just affecting the psychoactive\nportion of the body, okay? They are affecting the brain, but also even\nmore so, throughout the course of the body in our inflammatory system, in our immune\nsystem and everything that we need to know there. CB1 is found mostly in the brain, however. So CB1 is the one that affects your mood,\nit affects emotion, it affects a lot of things when it comes down to your appetite, even\ncoordination, movement and pain that relates to your brain and how you perceive it. And then we have CB2. CB2 works on the body, works on inflammation,\nworks on the immune system, and there is a correlation between CBD1 and CBD2. They communicate, of course. But one is more so for the brain and one is\nmore so for the immune system and for the body. What you're going to find is that THC activates\nboth of these, but here's what's interesting. Do not believe all of the marketing that says\nthat CBD oil only affects CB2 receptors. That is not true. That's not how it works, okay? CB2 receptors have to do with the immune system\nand inflammation like I said. But CBD oil does not directly affect CB1 nor\nCB2 receptors. It doesn't affect them at all. See, what it does is it influences the body\nto naturally utilize more of its naturally occurring endocannabinoids. See, endocannabinoids are things that our\nbody can create, but we also get them from food and various polyphenols that we consume. So, totally normal natural thing. Whether our body uses them is a completely\ndifferent story. So, CBD oil influences the body to utilize\nmore of the endocannabinoids that are already existing. Therefore, enhancing how those endocannabinoid\nreceptors, particularly CB2, actually utilizes them. So, it's not directly affecting the receptors\nthe way that THC would. But how does it actually work in the body? I'm talking about receptors, and that's all\nfine and dandy, but what physiological effect does this have? Well, here's the interesting thing. Even though you have a natural utilization\nof these endocannabinoids, it doesn't necessarily mean that the endocannabinoids are the end\nall, be all. You see, it's the by-product of this. It's the utilization and the activation of\nvanilloid receptors, of adenosine receptors, and serotonin receptors that ultimately give\nus this sensation, and the endocannabinoids result that we are seeking when we looked\nat a CBD oil. Okay? So, the vanilloid receptors end up working\nwith body temperature. They end up working with helping you regulate\nthat system within the body. Also helping you regulate inflammation through\ndifferent ways. If we have a higher core body temperature,\nit's going to affect our inflammation. If we have a lower core body temperature,\nit's going to affect our inflammatory levels within the body. So these vanilloid receptors play a key role,\nand they are directly correlated with the endocannabinoid receptors. But here's the really interesting one, adenosine. How many of you have ever had a cup of coffee? How many of you have ever had caffeine at\nsome point in your life? Chances are you have. So, you know that excited, excitatory feeling\nthat you get. Well, what happens with adenosine is you end\nup blocking adenosine with caffeine. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptor, which\ntherefore means that you get more excited because adenosine would normally make you\nrelaxed. So, if you have a lot of adenosine in the\nbody, you're relaxed. You might even be sleepy, but caffeine blocks\nthat receptor, which therefore makes you more energized. Well, CBD affects the adenosine receptor by\nincreasing the activity of it. So you might be wondering, \"What does that\nmean? It's going to do the opposite of caffeine?\" Well, kind of. It's going to do the opposite of the bad effect\nof caffeine in some ways. You see, when we actually have caffeine, we\nare basically blocking that adenosine receptor, and therefore triggering a secondary response. We're triggering a secondary response of excitatory\ncatacholamines. What that means is adrenaline, noradrenaline,\nepinephrine, all of the catacholamines that cause us to have this heightened sense of\nawareness and alertness. That's what's giving us the energy. It's not specifically the blocking of adenosine. So, when we do allow adenosine, we don't have\nthe opposite of epinephrine or adrenaline. They're really isn't an opposite of it. It's either just one or off. You don't go fully polar opposite with it. So basically, you're slowing down the epinephrine. You're slowing down the adrenaline and allowing\nyour body to relax. So, it's not like you're going to have the\nnegative effect where you're super, super-sleepy. You're just getting a calming effect which\nis why so many people like utilizing CBD oil. They just end up getting confused as to why\nit's actually doing it. Then we have to talk about dopamine receptors. Dopamine's a simple one. Dopamine is the reward system within the brain. So by activating dopamine, it ends up allowing\nus to feel better all the time. But it allows us to naturally utilize dopamine. We're not taking exogenous dopamine. We're not taking drugs. We're not taking recreational drugs, things\nthat are actually causing us to have more dopamine. We're naturally increasing the body's utilization\nof existing dopamine by enhancing the receptors' sensitivity. And in that same vein, we also talk about\nglutamate. You see, glutamate is something that is excitatory. Glutamate actually triggers energy, but too\nmuch of it is a bad thing. Too much glutamate can lead to a seizure,\nit can lead to all kinds of bad things. Glutamate is not what we want a lot of. However, the right amount of it can trigger\nenergy in the right places. So, when you think about the calming effect\nof adenosine making you calm, and then you combine it with a specific energy effect of\nglutamate. You actually have a really unique thing. You're calm, but that glutamate is activating,\nenergizing specific parts of the brain. Specific parts of the brain that are correlated\nwith memory and retention, so thereby you could have the right energy in the brain,\nstimulating creative process, all while feeling calm. So feeling calm, relaxed, anti-inflamed, yet\nstill awake in terms of your brain. So, very, very powerful when it comes to that. Then, of course, we look at the serotonin\nreceptors. What ends up happening is CBD activates something\nknown as 5-HT1A. 5-HT1A acts in a very similar way as an isosorbide,\nthe serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It allows our body to create more serotonin\nand utilize it more efficiently. So, that's going to help you feel good. Serotonin's just a feel good neurotransmitter\nin the first place. And lastly, cancer. I want to talk about this in a little bit\nmore depth in another video in the future, but basically we have specific signals that\nhappen in the body when it comes down to cancer. Yes, specifically I'm talking about GPR55. In this case GPR55 is something that triggers\nminerals and vitamins to be retrieved from the bones to ultimately feed cancer. That's why when people get cancer, a lot of\ntimes they end up getting weaker bones. A lot of times they end up increasing their\nrisk of fractures and things like that. So what ends up happening is CBD reduces the\nbody's ability to retrieve nutrients from the bone to feed cancer cells. This is just one of the many ways that CBD\nhas an effect on cancer, and it's one of the most researched. But of course, I'll do another video in the\nfuture that talks about how this actually has a specific effect on a multitude of different\nthings when it comes down to cancer. So, I hope that this video broke down CBD\nas a general overview and helped clear up some of the crazy marketing that's out there\nsurrounding CBD. I can totally understand why Facebook, why\nYouTube, why so many different media properties and media buying properties have made it so\ndifficult to advertise, and that has to do with the fact that people are really CBD in\nthe wrong way, and they're marketing it poorly, and they're flat-out lying. So this video is just a general overview to\nhelp you understand what happens in the body and why it does so. As always, keep it locked in here on my channel. If you have ideas for the future videos, let\nme know in the comment section. I'll see you soon."}
