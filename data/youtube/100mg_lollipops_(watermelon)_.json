{"ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to

watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "OoIQQgKgrt0": "hello and welcome back thank you for coming back to the V Mars Channel today I am trying something

good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it doesn't this because I didn't work for me does not mean that it will not work for you okay think about your tolerance I haven't stigma to this I hate staring into the actual like lens because my eyes getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does not mean no will not work for you I hope this would help someone out peace out toodles and Happy Trails don't have patrols out there", "CEzAOPIgfZk": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey its Lucky Penny shop and we are doing a fruit slice lollipop now recently not too long ago maybe two or three weeks ago I did a green lime fruit sliced or green apple fruit sliced lollipop in a cotton candy video and I smashed it up yes this beautiful lollipop got smashed and we had someone in the comments uh wonder if we could actually make a video of those so we had the orange and the watermelon still and here you go here is the video now what I want to say is that we don't mention people's name in the comments for a reason because it just opens up a door of hundreds of people wanting their name mentioned but I will thank people in the comments so let's move on now so we'd have the watermelon slice and the orange slice and this was the green apple kind of look like that with a seed and the texture just looks so realistic on these the whole lollipop in general looks realistic now I'd say the watermelon looks the least realistic because it's so clear but they do add the seeds to make it look like you're eating a piece of watermelon Greenbrier international well let's open them up I don't put a bulb up and I'm gonna taste the watermelon I see breath Musti and I remember correctly and it was double wrap so this and each lollipop was wrapped and I will find out all right that into the case now look it's wrapped again once we get all the plastic off and we'll see how cool this looks in the light there you know reflecting and it seems pretty tough so I'm not trying to handle it carefully because it's pretty thick this is something to put it out so now I'm in see how thick it is so that is the watermelon let me get out and the thicker when your finger is where my fingers behind iku that's cool look like it was a color change in the actual lollipop look at the outside of the orange does that let me that's a different kind of material candy whatever you want to call it so that's hard also and look how thick it is there all right so what do you want me to try first let's see let me try the watermelon now am I in my initial instinct is to bite it but I don't want to bite it so this is hard to let me just give it a taste hmm it's good now I didn't get a strong watermelon flavor let me take a look at the orange now that one definitely has a really good strong orange flavor like I said I just want to bite that look how cool they look let me get these out of here so you can just see these and through them and the thickness look how thick the oranges it's even thicker than the watermelon oh I think I like the flavor of the orange the best now the green apple that we did in the cotton candy that was super tasty also overall I would say if you're a lollipop fan you would dig these now we got these at the Dollar Tree and I've seen them at different dollar trees by the cash register in the candy aisle and I think it's worthy if you get a chance to get out there to your dollar store to pick one of these up flavor is good and it's kind of unique isn't it the shape and the size so there you go it is the fruit slice lollipops if you want to see more candy like this look in the description for a playlist and as always search our channel and if you want recommend to these you know say it in the comments and I will thank you down there

"XYejE3n8Sf0": "guys today i get to try slaps lollipops a foldable watermelon flavored lollipop i'm pretty excited look at these like a dragon tongue on a stick this looks pretty intriguing it looks kind of like a fruit roll up on a stick but from what i hear the flavor's kind of intense and for a fan of everything but watermelon i'm a little scared of that why even have the stick that's my first question i feel like i don't know how to eat it or just pull right off all right let's try it guys it feels like a fruit roll-up very easily sticks to each other kind of compresses and gets like soft and chewy holy crap whoa air's like sticking to my tooth okay i'm gonna finish this and then we'll have a talk holy watermelon batman oh man okay we're stuck to the roof of my mouth super tangy super flavorful really it makes your mouth water just like touching it to your tongue if you enjoy the flavor of a watermelon jolly rancher this is your candy i have never experienced anything like that before it is incredibly sugary incredibly sweet that is packed with flavor like an overwhelming amount of flavor she is a mixture between jolly rancher hard candy and a fruit roll up the same kind of crystalline hard candy sugar formation as a jolly rancher that like chew of the fruit by the foot fruit roll up the watermelon so good so accurate sometimes people sleep on watermelon candy they're not the strongest flavor in the bunch this is my goodness you covered your watermelon and sugar like i feel like i need to spit out the seeds after eating this", "himqhMl-mzI": "[Applause] [Music]

here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "GakeYj3uu4o": "(bright music) - Hi guys! Welcome Back to - That Youtube Family! - And today we are actually going to be making some lollipops. Some really cool lollipops that are going to be in the shape of our faces maybe? Or - They'll be beautiful! - Whoever's faces we choose. So we are actually at a\ncandy shop called Spun where you can make your own treats. It is in London. - You can personalize them. - Yes, and so you can\npersonalize lots of lollipops so look over here and there is actually a lollipop face. That's what we're doing today! - [Audrey] That looks crazy hard. - We are going to try. - But we'll become masters. - We're going to be\nmasters so I chose that I want to make Jordan. - And I'm making our dog, Logan. - [Audrey] Who are you doing? - I'm gonna make me cause\nI think it'll be easy. - [Audrey] Who are you making? - Dad. (laughs) - [Audrey] Two dads! - I'm making a random face. - Jake's making someone random\nand I am making myself, so. Let's go! - [Mom] How excited are you? - So excited. - [Mom] Boys, how excited\nare you to be here in the candy factory? Yes? - [Jordan] I hope we all get our faces. - You can watch them make the candy and it says on the sign\nthat they can teach you. - [Jordan] What? - [Jake] I wanna learn! - They're gonna teach us. They're gonna teach us how to make candy. - DIY! - [Mom] What do you think\nabout eating someone's face? - I'm not gonna make a face. - [Jordan] Logan's baby face? - Aww! The baby! - [Jordan] So cute! - Yes, I want Logan. - [Mom] Ty, who would you eat? - Audrey. (laughter) - [Mom] Alrighty. Let's get Audrey's face\nand have Ty eat it. Challenge accepted. - I'll make a really good face like... - [Dad] Okay. They are\nchoosing their flavors of candy for their face. - How about Tooty Fruity or Lime? - [Dad] Let's go with Tooty Fruity. - Tooty Fruity? - Alright, Mom and I\nare gonna be the same. We're gonna be Tooty\nFruity and everybody else is probably gonna pick like Coconut or Pi\u00f1a Colada or Lime. Some crazy flavor. (fans) - [Dad] This is the first step. Nobody can make up their mind. This could a long day. Okay, here comes the sugar. It's extremely hot. - So, let's get started. In this pot, we have a\nmixture of sugar, water and glucose that we've\nheated up to 155 degrees, so it's very, very hot. Hotter than your kettle at home. What we're going to do,\nwe're going to pour in our Tooty Fruity flavor. - [Dad] You chose Tooty Fruity? _ Yes. - [Dad] Alright, Tooty Fruities! - [Employee] So what\nyou're seeing now is just the liquid evaporating\nfrom our flavoring but the flavor will remain inside\nof our candy mixture. - [Dad] You think a genie's\ngonna pop out of there? - I hope so. (bright music) (fans) - So do you know the name of the material this table is made of? - [Audrey] Granite? - [Dad] Granite. - Granite. Do you know what\nthe granite table does? - [Mom] Back up, Ty. Do you smell that guys? - [Audrey] Do you smell that? - [Jordan] It smells so good! - [Dad] Is that bubbling because it's got air in it or is that\nbubbling cause its lava? - Lava! It smells really good. I'm glad we chose the Tooty Fruity. - I think they just made\nthe world's largest sucker. - [Audrey] Oh yeah! - [Mom] It's like huge. - [Dad] Yummy. - [Mom] Look how big that is! - [Employee] So. Do you know what the granite table does? - [Mom] Nope. - [Employee] So it absorbs the heat. So what's gonna happen- - [Dad] Alright so they're\nmaking the face color. What do you think Audrey? Is that your face pigment? - She's pretty pale. - I don't know. Does it look the same? - [Dad] I don't know,\nmaybe a little lighter. A little orange, Audrey. (playful music) - [Audrey] What is going on? I am so confused. - [Dad] Oh they're cutting it. - [Audrey] What? - [Employee Woman] We just\ncut the edges with scissors. And now we take the colors and pull it across the table, pull\nit out a little bit more. - [Mom] Wow. That's magic. - [Dad] I would have\ntotally messed that up. - [Mom] I would have messed this up too. - [Female Employee] You just\ndon't want to cool it down too much, that's why I'm\ntaking it to a heated table right now. So it's heated to 75 Celsius degrees. - Do you know what we call (mumble)? - [Off-Screen Female] Uh, no. - It's a non-Newtonian\nfluid, and candy is the same. So, when left alone, it's nice and soft. If you apply force to it,\nit turns into a solid. - So we just need to fold this, to have the same consistency as we work. - [Dad] Who's excited? - Me! - [Dad] Who's feeling artistic? - I don't know. I'm worried that I'll mess up. - I am not an artist. - Hey, if you're gonna paint this canvas, you better be accurate. (laughter) - Yikes! - [Dad] All right, we'll\npaint Mom so it looks good. - I'm trying to paint\nJordan as Buddy, the Elf. - Oh, no! She has a picture, too,\nwhen I was Buddy the Elf. - [Female Employee] And now we start making a demonstration for you guys; how to make faces. So, I'm going to try and make Jack's face. - [Jack] What a handsome devil. (laughter) - [Female Employee] Just don't want to use too many\ncolors so that's why I'm just going to make a\nsmall version of the face. So, with this white, that looks creamy, we need to do something\nto make it lighter, and more white, and also (mumble). What do you think we should do with it to make it whiter? When you mix, when you stretch, actually, you add air bubbles to our sugar to make it more fluffy and lighter. So I'm going to do it with hands. - [Mom] That's your swirl. It's the slime swirl, guys! - [Dad] Jordan, you should\nbe very good at this. - I'm just doing this\nwith hands, but if we have bigger batches making a crop, for example, of lollypops, we use a loop that's over there on the wall, and\nwe stretch it like that. So it's kind of a challenging workout. - So we can do anything\nup to 14 kilos here. So this is a six kilo batch, so you can imagine how much 14 kilos is. - But this is just like one kilo. It changes the texture so it's\nmore like meringue, maybe. - [Dad] Professionals\ngonna show us how to do it. I have a bad feeling they're\ngoing to turn us loose. - [Mom] I think I changed my mind. I think I'm going to make an alien. That might be easier. - [Female Employee] So\nnow we've done the nose. - [Jack] When we're doing\nthe bridges of the nose, as well, you'll want to make sure we're pushing up so we're\ngetting the height of the nose. Now, we're going to do the nostrils, so you'll dig in two holes, and then using each\nnostril, we're going to slowly put each stick\nin and pull up and out to create our nostrils. - [Dad] What do you think? - I'm worried. - [Dad] Are you gonna be able to do that? - No. (bright music) - [Dad] Okay, so that\npiece of candy cannot talk back, and see back at you. - This is hard. - [Dad] I'm imagining what\nours are gonna look like - Ugh - See, the face is wonky\nand pale (fans) this is still quite hot, so I'm going to place it on the cooling table, and your cooling tables are over near the wall, so yeah. - [Jack] Before we get started, I'm just going to tell you a few things. On the tables behind you, I'm going to be bringing around some gloves. [Dad] Good luck, you'll need it. Okay, they've set us free. Time to make our masterpieces. Jake, are you ready for this? - It's just like slime! - [Dad] All right, Audrey. I expect greatness from you. I think I heard Ty say he was going to make the best looking guy in the house. Who you making? - Dad - [Dad] Dad? And Jordan is going to\nattempt to make Logan. - This is going to be hard. I don't know how I'm going to make Logan. - [Dad] We'll see about that. - Yeah. - [Dad] Okay, I'm going to let you guys get some of the details,\nthen we'll come back. Okay, so, I've got mine started. There's the beginning of mine. Oh, I've got something on my nose. I wonder what that was. Okay. Jordan is - I don't know! I don't know\nhow to make a doggy face! What's the shape of Logan's face? - [Dad] I don't know. Good luck with that one. - [Audrey] I'm so lost. - [Dad] Audrey's made like, if you want to make an eye, you do indents like that. - [Audrey] I don't even know what to do. - [Dad] Jake, good job Jacob. Look at that. Getting a good one. - [Audrey] Maybe we should just leave this to the professionals. - [Dad] What's Mom doing? Oh, look at Mom! - [Mom] Making Jordan. - [Dad] Making Jordy. - [Mom] Trying. - [Dad] Trying. Good job Ty. - And now what you're going to do is get the sticks and we're going\nto make two nostrils. - [Dad] I like it. Going to make my nose? - [Jack] So then, I'll do one, you do one. We're going to put the stick in, and bring it out. There you go. - [Dad] Good job, Ty. I didn't take my mat with me. Good luck. Good luck. - I don't even know. - [Dad] All right, how we doing here? - [Jack] If it's cooled down, you can. But don't eat any warm candy. - [Dad] This is mine,\nthe beginnings of me. Nana's working on it, Jake's working on making the nose again. Nana's going with some black eyebrows. How we doing over here, Ty? Oh, look at this! Audrey's going with some green eyes. Really green eyes. Grandpa's going with googly eyes. How's Grandma doing? - Well, trying to make something\nthat looks a little human. - [Dad] How's Mom doing? Maybe! - [Mom] Not so good. My teeth are breaking, but - [Dad] Get some color in those eyes and some hair on there, it\nmight look just like you. All right, gotta get back to making, or we're going to lose\nour heat on our candy. Okay, next step. I got my eyes and my mouth done. Let's see. Can anybody guess what Jordan's making? - [Jordan] You already told. - [Dad] Logan. All right, Nana's got the eyes. And the teeth, and the eyebrows. How we doing over here, Jake? - [Jake] Okay, I'm doing okay. - [Dad] Jake's getting it going! Good job. How's Ty Ty doing? Your guy looks beautiful, whoever that is. How we doing over here, Audrey? - We're doing. - [Dad] We're doing? - Does that look like me? Probably not. My eyes are a bit more brown, but I didn't have the time or the energy to mix it. - [Dad] Here's Mom. Looking beautiful. Grandma's is missing an eyeball. Grandpa's making Mr. Potato Head. Okay, fun, fun. Okay, Jordan, how we coming? - This is what it looks like so far. - [Dad] Oooh, nice. - It's not all the way done, though. We still have to add in a few more things. - [Dad] Pretty dang close, though. Let's check out Grandpa's over here. There is Grandpa's. - [Jordan] Ooh, it's a unibrow. - Zoot-a-loo - [Dad] All right, here's mine. I don't know who it is. It's a good looking guy, though. That's all I know. All right, Nana, how are you doing? Are you putting your eyelashes on? - [Nana] I'm putting my - [Dad] Okay, Jake how we doing? - [Jake] Good. - [Dad] Getting there. Nice. How we doing down at this, oh my goodness. What did you do? Oh, this is Jordan when she dressed up as Buddy the Elf at the mall. - [Audrey] Oh, Mom, that's really good! - [Grandma] That's really cute. - [Mom] I have no idea what I'm doing. - [Grandma] That is so cute. - [Dad] And here is Grandma's. - [Grandma] That's kinda bad. - [Dad] Oh, they're all good. Ty, let's see this one. - [Jack] All finished. - [Dad] Beautiful looking guy. Look at that! I like it! Is that me? Nice! And let's see how Audrey's doing here. - [Audrey] I decided\nto make Dobby instead. - [Dad] Audrey's making Dobby. - Just kidding, I didn't mean to. But it turned out my face\nis actually Dobby-like. - [Dad] Looking good, though. - I have a chunky eyebrow. Look, doesn't that look like Dobby's eyes? - [Dad] Take the blade\nand put lines in it. All right. Okay, so. - We're cooling bits of\ncandy, and snacking on 'em. - [Dad] You guys are eating candy? - Yeah. - [Dad] So rate this on\na scale from one to ten. Ten being the hardest, one\nbeing this was super easy. What would you say? - Six. - [Dad] Six? - Eight. - [Dad] You say eight? Is that hard? - It was hard. - [Dad] Well, you did a really good job. I think this is a\ngood-looking chap, don't you? Yeah? All right, we're just\nwaiting on Miss Audrey, here. She got her eyebrows on, now we got to get her some hair. Can't wait to see what\nshe does with her hair. It should be interesting. She needs lips, too. - No I just wanna go - [Dad] Okay, so there\nis Nana and Grandpa. Their creations. There is mine. And Jacob's. He gave himself rosy cheeks. There's Audrey, her finished. She's saying \"Ooh!\" - [Audrey] She's going \"Aaah!\" - [Dad] Whose is this one, Grandma's? - [Woman's Voice] Grandma's. - [Ty] And this is the best one so far. - [Dad] This is the best one? Oh, look at that one, Ty. Good job! And then there's Mom's! Making Jordan! - [Audrey] Do we have two Dads? - [Dad] Yes, we have two Dads. I didn't know I was\nsupposed to make Ty, so. We got two Dads, and no Ty. - He's the favorite. - [Dad] And then there's Logan. - [Jordan] There's Logan. So cute! - [Dad] Logan can't be here today with us. - So I made him a lollypop. - [Dad] So Jordan made him a lollypop. - Okay, so we just got\nfinished making our lollies shaped like ourselves,\nand that was super fun. What did you guys think\nof making the lollypops? - It was so cool, and super fun. It was actually a lot\nharder than I thought, but it turned out great, and we got a certificate at the end and our own personalized lollypops! This is so cool! - And they taste yummy, too. Ty and I actually sneaked a little. It was really good. - So comment down below who you guys think did the best job at\nrecreating their portrait. - I didn't make myself. - Ty did the best job. Okay, so we will leave a link down below, in the description box, where you can check out Spun, if you want to come here and make your own lollypop in your face, or a friend\nor family member's face, this would be pretty cool to do. Also, be sure to check out\nInstagram, @ThatYoutub3Fam where we will post more pictures, up close, of our lollies completed. - That was so fun. I didn't even think you\ncould make a lollypop of your face, so that was a surprise. And I had a lot of fun doing it. - Me too. - We had a lot of fun. You guys liked it?

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

time to make a vlog about this kind of beast lollipop has everybody been asking so yeah it is um you know a lot of people have been asking me can you get high of a cannabis lollipop right hmm how about a little more i don't know so that's what we're about to find out today guys let's see if we can get high of cannabis lollipop but before i try i want to do some research on the internet and as you guys can see right here what it says about the cannabis lollipop and actually i bought this in the street sorry in amsterdam and what i found out here on the website it says that anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop here in the netherlands doesn't contain any thc so i don't think uh lollipop i cannot this lollipop can get you high to be honest guys but we about to find out today it's about to go down let's go guys first of all as you can see i act this is how it leaked with the amsterdam written on it and you have the lead logo on it let me open it and try this so we can [Music] see if you can really get high of cannabis lollipop or not but as we already know the answer guys you can get half cannabis lollipop though i'm gonna go ahead and try it anyway to show you guys so if anybody ever show you or you can hear how the cam is really about that that's [ __ ] actually as it says and let me open this it's just a little bit hot to open guys [Music] [Laughter] are you serious [Music] do a few moments later finally guys [Music] that's a whole lot of work to open the lollipop it wasn't i noticed so i opened it it was very sticky it's very sticky um [Music] actually it smells like weed to be honest okay [Music] oh hold on a minute guys [Music] i don't like the taste to be honest guys like i don't like the taste but for some people it might taste good it tastes like sweet actually and i haven't noticed any effect on i get how to feed anything like that just to say that's easy i want to do the research now anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop doesn't contain any thc and if you don't have thc in your canopies you can get high like so if anybody ever tells you how this that's [ __ ] because you can't get high off it cannot be lollipop it doesn't contain chc so it's just like our regular candy so if you have a key definitely don't recommend you to buy this for a kid guys because uh cannabis is drugs it's legal in some countries some countries not so i can't recommend any mother or family person to buy this for their kid no if you ever see this as i just ignore it but just so you know you can't get out of this i don't give that to my kids to be honest i won't give this to my kids but i'm just saying like it tastes pretty much okay but bruh oh if you make my thongs green right [Music] actually it doesn't taste that bad to be honest but for me i don't like these just like locris they you know so how do i recommend you guys to buy these yeah if you're 18 upwards i recommend easier to buy this you can actually find it in most of the shops in the upstate area most of the shops around upside you can find this here so you don't need to go to a coffee shop to buy a cannabis lollipop guys wait a minute you can buy a almost every shop here in amsterdam oh that says on the reset that i did you can only buy anything that contains thc in the cannabis shop so don't let anybody try to play you anybody trying to fool you or make you feel like oh i just take two of these or i just get half a cannabis lollipop because that's [Music] not me so here you have it guys you can get out of this [ __ ] so [Music] and the coffee shop is about to close in 10 minutes time so you know what's up guys my [ __ ] i gotta go born today see you next time guys and don't forget to subscribe like share my vlog have a nice day guys", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can go back and you should have all the information if you have any questions for me please comment I don't really know how to oh alright it has showing life but I don't have I only

know how to shut it off let's seal it like that", "HyltTHYfeh8": "hello and welcome to the episode 12 of the kanji geyser and today I have another edible review this time it's for a sucker from mountain height suckers or lollipop whatever you want to call it so was I mountain higher sucker for buying one let's find out together so far I got a watermelon and a grape flavored one for seven dollars as the Saturday but I wouldn't get one special at the giving tree dispensary but again as always I always review based on the list price so if you go there any other day one of these is going to cost you seven bucks the active ingredient content of this is a total of 39 milligrams which is pretty low but it has a very high cbt CBD content of 12 milligrams and so far this is the first product I've had that actually lists CBD separately that I've found so I that gives me a real plus one for that I like that testing information it makes this geezer happy I like quantification of the content of the medicine it was tested by a company called kin lab CA NLA BS here in Denver I'll post a link down in the description I know it costs more to quantify the active ingredients but I think it's well worth it nice packaging here just wrapped in a little baggie with a ziploc best if used by 1231 2012 so a very clear expiration date another plus some of these other edibles don't even have an expiration listed the ingredients are water sugar corn syrup natural and artificial flavor and may contain nuts ethanol hash oil extraction so let's give this sucker and unwrapping literally just has a rips through the label there and there's a little ziplock on the top so you push it through and I'm only going to take about half of this I'm always very cautious and from new products so I will pause it now and take about half of it and I'll be back briefly to give you my assessment of the flavor right all right I ain't about half the sucker and if you ask me what flavor this was supposed to be I would say sugary weed flavor a very distinct Tweedy flavor once again it doesn't taste at all like a watermelon Jolly Rancher and you know some if you know I didn't know it said watermelon on the label I never would have made that association it's just a very strong bitter THC flavor along with the sugar I tell you the person or persons who can create an edible and successfully mask this taste will have my dollars but so far I've tasted it in every product that I've reviewed or tried so far one good thing is it didn't break up in my mouth it stayed solid didn't break up like the lemon Dobbs drops I reviewed a few weeks back and it's fairly dense it took a good 10 minutes to get to the Tootsie Pop Center to get about halfway through it so it wasn't very it was it was like a good solid sucker so now I'm going to I can already start feeling the effects it's only been about five minutes since I stopped ingesting it so if I'm already feeling something coming on so I'll get back with you tomorrow and let you know the effects and it worked out [Music] [Music] all right it's the next day and I'm ready to give you my final assessment of the mountain high watermelon sucker from Mountain High suckers this is the half that I didn't take last night and I am really glad I didn't take the other half we'll get to that in a sec let's recap for me how do I do these reviews if you haven't seen one of these before I base my reviews on for quite four criteria taste pain relief side effects and value and let's start with taste recap taste from yes from pre earlier not very good not good at all very weedy not as good as a cough drop or something like that so I'm gonna give it a 6 I mean it's just not very tasty and I was expecting for watermelon at least a taste of like a watermelon Jolly Ranchers and again I couldn't tell what flavor it was so 6 for um taste pain relief this is where I'm glad I only took half very good body buzz I mean very very much of a body high and excellent pain relief pain down the legs gone completely back pain pushed into the background just the way I like it and another great thing since this wasn't a true edible as a sucker I felt relief within 15 minutes of dosing and surprisingly after that it lasted a good three and a half hours so high CBD FTW I'm going to say and I give the pain relief rating of this sucker a nine out of ten moving on side effects side effects i base on again the review I don't really like the hi of marijuana I know the eye rolls out there but it's true so I'm looking for something with very little psychoactive effects and I've experienced a very light head high it really wasn't that bad and it was very manageable significant tranquilization from the other side of it from the CBD so it made me tired but not to the point of crawling into bed and passing out or watching really bad TV or anything like that so it was very manageable so low side effects I'm going to be giving this an 8 rating for side effects and again 8 the higher is the better rating so 8 out of 10 value now here's where it gets a little squishy 39 milligrams per 7 dollars now that gives it a ratio of 5.6 milligrams per dollar that's the worst by far that of any edible that I've taken and that's an all-time low but I'm gonna take into account a couple of it things here that needs to be addressed by all the manufacturers that I I think one I'm gonna be generous because on this rating because the label on here rated the THC CBD and CBN percentages that clearly labeled with an expiration date everything I want to see in a medicine and it was tested by an independent laboratory that's labeled on here so very clear very professional packaging also it was very well manufactured the sucker didn't fall apart it didn't fall off the stick or anything like that so I'm gonna add two points to a base rating of 5 that I'd have given it for value and bumped it up to a 7 based on all those other factors alright so in summary we have a taste rating of 6 a pain relief rating of 9 a side-effect rating of 8 an a value rating of 7 gives us a grand total conjugator g\u00e9za rating of seven and a half and I'm gonna be generous and round this up a full ganja geezer rating of 8 out of 10 and the reason I'm being you know not going down instead of up at seven point five is that I want manufacturers and edibles to be watching this and to say please test your products and document them and put those results on the label the Geezer likes that very much so that's it for now and if you like this or found it useful please click the like button below the comments both good and constructively bad and if you like this channel subscribe to it as well so for now I'm going to say goodbye and stay medicated",

livebox specialty masks were using today we butter / can of water whatever you want to call it get high better that make you feel good juju today we're using my form of it I like youth coconut oil cause it draws out the most THC out of the lead for some reason I don't necessarily know the science part of that don't but I do it with very good understanding of how that [ __ ] works and it can be substituted for a regular letter so the recipe were using today actually calls for regular butter but I'm just substituting same thing at cold temperature or room temperature cocoa butter I'm sorry coconut oil will freeze and make it usable as butter if you melt it it's gonna become a will so you can use it it's very malleable now we're gonna let me show you guys what we're working with here we've got two tablespoons yes two tablespoons of water one and a half tablespoons of vinegar and we've got one teaspoon of salt sea salt to be specific a high-quality it looks like nothing's in there but daily hey there's something in there I promise yeah then we have the cocoa might throw up my baby boo but baby doodoo and it's gonna taste bad hum and then we've got one cup of brown sugar right here and last but not least we have 1/4 cup of sheriff liked it or not the darkness once it's all finished we're gonna mix in some vanilla extract the only reason I don't have that way that was because I like to do this by eye so to speak they call for a teaspoon just kind of portion today the recipe calls for us they pretty much just mix all of this in the pot so yeah man have you come over here I'll show you how to do this by the way we're drinking a Bohemia it's a pilsner don't really know the [ __ ] oh yeah it tastes good sure the first yeah so you put the heat on after you add everything yes okay he goes on a hot pot of burning sugar before you think you started it makes sense isn't the bottom of the sugar 1/3 water in vinegar hmm no been the corn syrup this person a little tricky because the brew is in the bowl this is why you should always have a rubber spatula I've mentioned that before make sure you keep your rubber spatula with you okay was it medium I don't know how you're still worse don't use an electric stove and I don't I don't know sponsored by Stokes if you use an electric stove at home you need to throw that [ __ ] trash yeah stir it a little bit right make sure I'm not sure the bottles combined yeah and then we can add that I stood this butter here all right so we're just gonna pretty much get this to a boil I'll show you guys what it looks like on the back to the world but the whole ultimate goal here or the end goal is to get this to be 300 degrees that's gonna be a hard crack it's much easier when you have what's called the candy thermometer Andy it's very easy to measure and even tells you what it's called that's gonna be called a hard crack meaning like this it's gonna be not chewy little more than a lollipop texture so yeah we're just gonna blow this out and let everything out together so at first this is not gonna look like it's coming together it's gonna look very separate like your sugar that the bottom of it and that the link was just kinda at the top not makes me bitter but as you can see keep boiling this is not something that you want to keep stirring by the way just stop as you keep boiling you'll see that it starts to blend together okay we're just about at 300 now which should be a hard crack temperature and starting to solidify just a little bit have any worried that the wood is starting to come together so to speak so go for like two more minutes we're gonna give it a chance to cool it down and we'll come back and show you when it cooled and then let's start to transfer it to the mold but it means this little container here it's just a lot of measuring jar to make it a little bit more you won't and then I just also add a little bit of vanilla extract just gonna starting to cool down I'll give you some flavoring actually I want to add something else for flavorings so that I really know the proof why should it rate and nephews away right there you are alright now we're gonna start pulling into the molds ooh that's hot this book mmm cannot fast swirl the lollipop stick in there to get it's all to sit yeah I don't work a little clipping at this - I chose always so size [Laughter] that's okay they're still warm and I solidify them when I close the lid go for it on that right now we need to work quickly because the rest of the mold arch the caramel is still very hot and I want guys to come out so I'm just gonna work work on the stick place man it won't be some sideways ass looking sticks sorry another thought mm-hmm were you making this video about was perfect hmm cuz you're on time oh yeah you tell I don't work out I do push ups and push ups push ups when you lift your fingers are the only thing gonna work out okay now to form Oh as you can see it got a little a little friendly

Kanak oh I had not seen that there that's exciting that hopefully makes me optimistic I didn't know this was made by Kanak oh the flavor X bars I have only tried their fruit bars before exiting back there they're they're gummy snacks and did not really enjoy them but chocolate is usually a much better vector for THC and this is a pretty huge brand I see them everywhere everywhere this is the new regulations size 10 milligram pieces 100 milligram total although it says it actually has not yet been a lab tested there again you can see Hanako so we are gonna be optimistic and hope that it is as good as the other Kanaka products and better than the Flav Rx products I've already reviewed so here we are here is our flavor X bar inside its packaging oh and this cost me 20 bucks at my Long Beach dispensary so I'm out in line with the 100 milligram edible now which is a bit unfortunate it let's dig it out and there we go pretty simple ten pieces very small pieces of chocolate I guess they're only ten milligrams and again it is toffee flavored so let's give it a try well there's some good quality chocolate mmm no cannabis tasters because I don't really taste anything but hmm good rich milk chocolate top you provide is a nice little crunch the flavor front could not be more happy with it but guys as you all know it's not about how it tastes I mean you wanted to taste good but what you really wanted to do is to get you high and for that guys like all our reviews I'm gonna finish off this flavor X bar over the next couple of minutes here and then once I finish it I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling is that's the most important part of any animal review so wish me luck I know I've got my fingers crossed I hope this one's gonna be a winner and I'll see you guys in just a bit I'm back and has actually been more than two hours since I checked in with you with the flavor rx bar I got a little ahead of myself in my activities but I am happy to tell you this is a good product um I did not like flavor X cartridges and I did not like their candy but I quite like this chocolate bar I tasted really really good on the upper end of the chocolate it's not the best of the best I've had but really pretty damn good and it's quite potent for a hundred milligram edible this really did the trick for me um I'm hoping or suspecting that the made by Cana Co is why that this one did the trick so this Flav rx chocolate bar is actually gonna get a big thumbs up from me it's not a plus tier like your Kiva or your de francais but it is close it is tasty it's pretty affordable in this new world um and uh it'll get you high so flavor X toffee 100 milligram bar that's gonna be a thumbs up for me give it a chance if you see it at your dispensary think you'll be happy you did and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on our next row deuces", "-_hhZdGhF2Y": "okay today we are going to make cannabis lollipops first things you will need are tempered candy molds to absorb the heat of 350 degree molten hot sugar lollipop sticks also tempered candy molds for the diamond door Jolly Rancher shaped candies you'll also need sweet bags to put through their beautiful lollipops and once you are completed you also need flavoring each bottle is one dram you'll want to use one to two jams of flavoring for the recipes that I am using food coloring and some high-grade eh-oh to make it real tasty you will be putting all that into the pot you need a candy thermometer it goes up to 350 degrees for hard crack stage in the pot you'll want to put two cups of sugar one cup of corn syrup and one cup of water slowly bring it to a boil and then let it cook until it reaches the 350 degree hard crack stage then you will have to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "ATYn-KBNgc8": "what's up everybody welcome back to another episode of strange city today guys gonna be reviewing mile-high suckers um we're gonna got the we got the mixed berry flavor working with 10 milligrams of CBD and 30 milligrams of THC so that is what we have got going guys just getting into it here and open it up for you it does have a yes do have to bite it or open it with scissors because it is childproof guys so do mind that that it is not gonna have a seal I would open it the other way I just walked up so you got your lollipop here it's got an imprint of THC with an M underneath to say medical or to dictate medical tastes really good but we're gonna get out of here guys see you shortly 30 minutes an hour so I'm like that not sure gonna let this kick in and we'll come back and I just loved you guys off meant to do it a piece but with bad guys to review this after we're high from it peace guys what's up everybody welcome back to the second part of this lollipop mile ha sucker review guys mixed berry flavor from mile high 30 milligrams of THC 10 of CBD picked up at affinity guys today the repeat that we're doing on this is gonna be the more of how to fix and things like that the first part was more of the taste I'm still eating on it obviously I didn't finish it should knock me out went to sleep but very very good guys um the taste overall when you first start into a lollipop I pop second taste is gonna be that dry Hoshi powdery type taste I don't know that house to describe it you kind of have to eat inedible to illegal edible to to kind of get that flavor or that that taste for it so thank you paying a my Lighting's perfect leave it right there so we're pancake being my lighting studio basically really really good guys I would give this a good a good eight or nine out of ten I would say it eight out of ten the flavor is pretty strong on it of candidates I have have had some edibles that geez what are you doing that don't taste as strong of cannabis or that powdery taste I'm not sure if that's really doable with a lollipop but from edibles that have had those chocolate bars and drinks and stuff like that they have tended to be a little less weedy if you will and a little more of the lollipop or the other taste so that's not really hindering the full experience of you know an enjoyable edible so that being said guys basically this stuff is like edibles are a full-body hi to me I don't ever get edibles in my head on they never messed with me in the head it's always a body high and it's always something I don't really ever feel until about 75 milligrams but this was pretty good man I I didn't mean finished all of it i I did feel some effects from it which would just be kind of lighter body and [ __ ] your body weight seems lighter I'm just kind of floating you know spaced out but it's really good edible overall guys and for something to just kind of walk down the street if you will and eat which is illegal so don't do it but yeah it's a very concealable very discreet way of getting high you know around people or you know around around nobody just to do yourself if you don't like smoking cannabis or anything like that this lollipop would be great for you guys that's gonna be it for the mixed berry mile-high sucker review guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up below and subscribe for more peace guys", "F9LVcVeFH1Y": "[Music] everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at a brand new product from a brand new brand we are looking at county bushmaster Cowie Bushmaster the pot plant peanut butter and THC hundred milligram I believe it is a granola bar gluten free long lasting all-natural the Bushmaster bar on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition packs which I always love to see on edibles I like granola bars well I should say I like granola bars that are designed for you know like 10 year-olds kudos bars the things that are basically candy like kudos or Quaker Oatmeal granola bars so I'm hoping it's like that but we shall see I'm not as big of a fan of the granola bars that are actually healthy so this is the first time you've ever tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some measure of this if it's not too big the whole thing in front of you and just don't want to bore you with eating the whole thing and I'll come back to you guys then in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review all right so let's open this up give it the smell test give it the taste test see how it works here oh boy know a lot of nuts it's a very nutty looking for an old bar mostly just peanuts no real marijuana odor to speak of you can see the peanut butter and chocolate there you've got some a lot of peanuts some almonds some other things not a big nut fan but I'll do it for you alright so this is the Kalli Bushmaster plant peanutbutter THC let's give it a taste well it's very cute it's gonna take me a while to do this I don't even like nuts but that's not terrible um and the peanut butter binds it together really well we've got a nice taste that chocolates wear on the top is good um yeah that's not bad at all um that's really surprising I don't like peanuts I don't like almonds I do not mind the taste of this and it's got wheat in it which is are usually somewhere it makes it taste terrible to begin with so on the taste front if you are a fan of nuts or granola bars definitely a positive for this one definitely on the plus side um well I'm hope they're not gonna just hold me in front of you because I'll be helpful like six minutes two minutes down but I would have come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling and sorry for talking with my mouth full can't really help it I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this is hitting hopefully pretty well so I will see you guys then thank you so much thank you so much for watching weeds see you guys soon peace guys it's been 2 hours since I had the Kali Bushmaster pot plant peanut butter THC granola bar thingamajig and I am pleasantly surprised I'm pretty high for a hundred milligram edible I was pleasantly surprised with the taste I think this is an impressive little package Wow and I think it was rather affordable I think it was seven or eight dollars I can't remember the exact price but I thought it was tasty surprisingly potent my eyes are rather red for a hundred milligram edible guys I think this is a little hidden treasure I just happen to see these at a dispensary behind the counter hidden behind some other bigger products and I was like oh I'll try one of those and I think it's a real hidden in pleasure or a hidden treat III don't think it's that big of a brand maybe it is I don't know but I haven't seen it anywhere of a ban this dispensary so I think it's a small brand but if you see it at a dispensary near you and you like granola bars give it a try it's it's really good I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I just now noticed that their logo is eat your greens I get it okay but their products are really good or this product is really good highly recommended okay that's the Kali Bushmaster pop plant peanut butter THC comes highly recommended thank you so much for watching weeds guys we'll check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and

check you guys out on the next video", "21JMBlc-5M0": "well hello this is Darnell I'm 19 coming at you from my kitchen oh yes I am mm-hmm how the [ __ ] he doing I'm doing well I went back to the drawing board and I'm gonna bring you guys some Jolly Ranchers hard candy and suckers I've done these three times now and they've come out perfect each time so first let me just apologize that I'm not doing the demonstration live with you I will do one though I promise so this is what you're gonna need you ready 1 and 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Caro syrup 1/2 cup water citric acid your flavor and color and a gel paste food corn okay candy molds sticks a candy thermometer a knife or a vegetable cutter an 8 by 9 pan or an 8 by 8 panel all of these products can be purchased at Walmart or Target or anywhere like that with the exception of the citric acid you probably will have to get the citric acid online at Amazon I didn't find it in any grocery store around the food coloring gel that I used there's a Wilson brand and I didn't really care for it because the colors work that vibrant so I went with a generic brand that's called great value that I bought here for 2 bucks and I use the tiny bit of the red ok this flavoring they sell at Walmart there's two in a pack they're considered a dram you used one DRAM per Sippi so you will need one of these in the flavor that you like punched in paper and a saucepan and that is it my friend that is it okay so this is what you do I'm gonna pick a rib first like always tell ya this channel is for eighteen and older you know this right cannabis and cannabis enthusiast and if you are not going my friend get the [ __ ] off my channel would you subscribe up there comment down there hit that Bell if you want to know how I'm gonna go why I put up any videos like this you never know what a girl's gonna put up you just don't know give me a flavor hit that thumbs up on your way up oh it takes a second if you love this recipe I thought about going back old school I was raised on a farm and we homesteaded and I remember Carol syrup water and sugar and flavoring and you had candy so when I brought you the recipe for the gelatin I thought it was gonna be a little bit easier and I've had a couple people that are having some problems with their butter floating on the top and I bet it's probably because the temperature is off one or two degrees now a couple things I want to tell you fYI when you're making candy have everything ready to go prepared ready to go eyeing your pan with parchment paper have your thermometer out your molds out sticks out your knife and everything okay so now what you're going to do is we're gonna take a rib you're gonna put down in the comments what you're ripping on and now I'm going to tell you how to make it choose that just makes everything perfect alright grab a medium-sized saucepan take it and put it on the stove on a medium heat and you're going to add 3/4 cup of your Karo syrup and your 1/2 cup of water you're going to let that dissolve until your Caro syrup is completely dissolved then you're going to add your 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar keep stirring it mixing it up once that's all dissolved stick your candy thermometer on the side of your pan make sure that the bottoms not touching your pan or you'll get it false reading have your parchment paper in your pan lined your mold ready to go and your knife ready to go sometimes when you score you want to keep a little cooking oil on hand so have that out as well and we're going to talk about that once you get your sugar and your corn syrup and all that's incorporating it's boiling really nicely you continue stirring that so your sugars don't burn until you reach about a 250 degrees when your candy thermometer at that point I stopped stirring and I just watched my boil I don't walk away from my candy and then tell my candy thermometer reads 310 and when it reaches 310 I'll remove it from the stove place it on my cookie sheet I'm going to add my 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid my one dram of watermelon my gel red food coloring a slight amount because I did watermelon candies I infused my candies and also used two tablespoons of gorilla glue tincture and 6 grams of teeth by no means do you need to any of that in your candies and you can have that as an option if you are adding cannabis or tinctures to your candies please do that after you've removed it off the stove incorporate it when you incorporate your citric acid your flavoring and your gel mix it up really well Labe pour it in your pan and just set it on your cookie sheet okay at this point now you're just going to watch your solution it's going to begin to cool and as it cools you want to come by and grease your knife or your vegetable cover and you're just going to take your product that you pick off the stove and that's in your pan and if you look at my Instagram you'll see how I scored it now we're just going to imagine that this is our candy for a second if you will grease your knife or your vegetable cutter and just score right here in the center I worked Center out and then I turned it and worked Center out and just kept turning that now just a couple points if your candy won't score it's probably because it's too hot if your knife is sticking to it it's probably because you don't have enough oil on it so come back and try it again if you score it and it didn't work your candy will just wine itself back out again just periodically go back and do it depending on where you live and the altitude of where you live is how long it'll take and it's generally around 8 to 10 sometimes 12 minutes and you'll be able to score it then just set it take it out of your pan set it on your cookie sheet because you're scoring it let it sit on your counter for an hour and you can come back and you can break them into pieces now I made suckers and I made Jolly Rancher candies wat kaminin and puts him in a pretty jar for me and I did six seconds and these are what the candies look like they're perfect and then I made up a little package of ten and I usually do like though giveaways and gifts and things like that with some suckers and some granola bars or whatever these are very perfect size they're just like the Jolly Ranchers they're amazing hard hard hard this will make about I'd say 35 to 45 pieces of candy depending on how big you cut your candy pieces up so if you have any questions let me know once your candy is all cooled and you've broken it up and you want to make some suckers I made square ones Walmart also has round ones like this what you do is take some of your broken pieces of candy mine are stuck because I'm videoing take and stick them in the molds and what I do is I really shove them down in the malls to well sometimes the mold looks deformed I turn my oven on at 275 I place this on a cookie sheet and I leave it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes until the candy becomes a gel again then I take it out and I place my six in it a couple minutes after that to make sure they don't fall over and you think you've got candy now because I make these in blueberry in fire watermelon and an apple I sometimes have a lot of variety pieces left over and I take them and break them up in a baggie and I stick them in the mold so that my suckers come out all different kinds apple cherry strawberry so that's what I did with these so those end up being like that posh posh if you will medicated candies that I make sucker southern they're amazing I do apologize that people had issues with that recipe I did go back to the drawing board and I thought shizzle man homesteading sugar corn syrup and water and play-doh you got candy so star go back to homestead you're not good you guys are going to love them these you can store up to a year in your freezer on your counter for a good month or longer if they last that long these tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers this is a must citric acid and the reason is is because citric acid gives candy its pop gives it its flavor gives Jolly Ranchers they're their sharpness their sourness and if you don't use this you won't get that Jolly Rancher flavor so make sure you get your flavoring of yours whatever one you like watermelon out or whatever use a little bit of paste they have the typical colors for Jolly Ranchers and use your citric acid you can use as much as a teaspoon of this the more you use I've used it it's better just don't go over a teaspoon and your sticks check your thrift stores go over and then I don't know where they have all the paperwork and all the books and coloring books and things like that they always have craft step-over they're not even open yet you can find your sticks with my duties since they're pretty cheap these molds Walmart everything here you can get at Walmart I will leave a description at the recipe below under this video and the only thing that you'll need to purchase online is probably your citric acid because I couldn't find it in grocery store unless you have a candy store near you I hope you guys love the recipe again any questions please let me know yes someone asked me for a how to clean glass bomb so I'm gonna bring that to you as well I have not forgotten about that she's been really really busy with the holidays and everything coming up orders are coming in so if you guys want your holiday orders get him in because miss Deb does get busy I'd love to fulfill your orders I hope you're having an amazing night I love you guys so so much and again I'm so sorry you had trouble with the last recipe I posted they bring you recipes because they're simple easy and they're [ __ ] good and if I screw up I'm sorry just make a girl aware slap a [ __ ] in the head and I'll go back to the drawing board and bring you another one click one letter one tree right you", "4MD06UCMUd8": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and I know I'm really close but there's a reason for it I'm gonna do an edible review and this stuff is the fat Panda or hot sugar Panda candy green apple powered by you fuse and every other brand that they like to throw in there so this is what it looks like this is just a one single serving ten milligram candy kind of like a it's supposed to be a soft chew so I'm gonna go ahead and open it like I said single piece I didn't you know just a single package I didn't get like they're ten pack that they have but there we go I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this is what it looks like once you open it just a weird little looks like a little turd kind of so look at me getting all smart using scissors now so that's what it looks like it feels exactly like if you if you've ever been a child airheads that's exactly what this feels like it's got that same consistency whoo it's got that same smell like I said this is green apples so I'm just gonna shove this whole thing in my mouth and enjoy it oh my god so as far as the flavor goes you guys are gonna hear me too it's fun all right so the flavor is actually really good I have it on the top of my room I like my mouth right now I've gone so the flavor is amazing I'm gonna have the other one right here in a second this was just a 10 milligram candy and yeah I'm gonna see how this reacts and I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let your w tomorrow and I'll let you know exactly how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried those watermelon candies as you guys know that obviously I ate it in the video so about an hour and a half to two hours later completely spaced the fact that I'd had an edible hadn't smoked yet and was sitting on the couch and I look over to my girlfriend I was like babe why do I feel so hot she looked at me and just started laughing and she was like oh yeah the watermelon candy you duh so yeah this thing even for just having had the 110 milligram candy it was enough to like send me into that edible hi I felt it I got tired I got a little bit of like the haziness and this was all by 5 o'clock so if if you're new to edibles this would be a great one because it's gonna give you like just enough of that like effect that you're gonna feel it and get you know the base knowledge of how it in edibles going to like a react in your body so all around I would and if you're more of like I guess a more seasoned user you can take 2 to 3 and have a great night either way these are awesome so with that I think that's it this has been recreational 4/20 if you guys have any questions or anything leave it down in the comment section if you like these videos go ahead and hit that sub button trying to get to a hundred before the end of this month and I'll be back again with you guys soon [Music]", "yy60ZTemVWI": "really if you guys are new to my channel please subscribe to the channel turn on that post notifications and and welcome back started on to this video so today's video we're gonna be doing the Panetta de sandia I've been seeing a I'm going around but the first person I honestly saw this video from is Ali I loved watching his video so I just wanted to do my palate to this India so that's why I decided to do so just keep on watching to see how I created this palette honest India is spicy table from Mexican lollipops oh yeah babes so just keep on watching this video to see how I created my palette that is India and hopefully use bins like this video and I'll see you guys later I hey babe so these are the items I'm gonna be using on some chamoy some tahini two knives one is a carving knife and the other ones are regular chopping knife my cutting board and these skewers of course watermelon and I'm gonna be using two plates so I'm gonna start off by marking how thick I want my slice and basically right here I'm just seeing how thick I want it and then I'm just gonna flip it over so I could just make a cut through the watermelon [Music] then I'm just gonna grab this slice that I cook and then I'm just gonna grab the slice of watermelon and make it a little bit smaller from the sides I'm basically just gonna cut straight down so I could make it a little bit smaller I have the desired length of my watermelon slice I'm gonna grab this little small carving knife and I'm just gonna make a little hole on the bottom of the watermelon so it could be easier when I try to put in the skewers I'm just gonna be placing them in the watermelon so I could just have like my lollipop stick basically [Music] I'm gonna start adding some oil on my watermelon the only thing I would honestly recommend these guys to do is go easy on the chamoy I actually learned through this this was a learning process for me because honestly I went in having with the chamoy and that I him will fall off the watermelon so I learned on the other side of the watermelon that I went easy on the chamoy that the king was sticking very well to the watermelon so I would recommend these guys to do that instead the last clip it was like my whole life falling apart honestly and then on the second round it was better that the king was thinking more because they didn't have so much turmoil so like I mentioned just go easy on the chamoy [Music] so this is the final resaw if you guys get heartburn I wouldn't recommend this yeah so we have gas treaty stay away from all this Chile and this is my version of the palatal Sandia and hope U's babes like this video and just keep on watching until the end of the videos you guys to see the final final result so that's how I created my palate of the Sandia and so now we're gonna be testing the palate of the Sandia this thing is huge as a month so let's just grab it this is gonna turn into a move-on more thing whatever you call in we're gonna get a little messy here so we're gonna take our first bite and let's see how this tastes this is massive guys look at this that is really good [Music] I can't even pull out all my whole water man I love how juicy it is and this is really messy guys like my shirt my shirt it's really messy think I you guys can see it just take another bite because this is bomb [Music] I'm gonna get on see you seen my shirt like that's really bad this is so good it is having trailers try it it's basically eating something with the him charm or you don't necessarily need to collect it you can color in little pieces and just add some oil at the heat and you should be good this is just being extra but this is so good guys and why don't you get the sticks cuz um your girls having a hard time holding the watermelon up this is so freaking good so my lollipop with mistake [Music] they're seriously goes your makeup some and it's really spicy like they really spicy but it's so good like if you like spicy stuff that's just a good snack but don't just go nice on the tahini and the chamoy just makes it a little bit more kind of sour and it's really thick like my so so hopefully you guys can see how they're in my shirt is but it got really messy but yeah I know we're sure you don't care getting messy with it so yeah so have a so hope you guys liked this quick little video um I just wanted to betray this because I love Tajin and I love chamoy and of course I love watermelon so those are the three best combo ever you could use chamoy and the hint with any other fruit if you guys don't like watermelon or if you don't have watermelon with you guys excuse any other type of fruit it's also bombed with mangoes oh my god mango stuck him in turmoil those are the best combination ever like those are best friends forever literally and if you don't like mango like I said if you use cucumbers any other type of fruit and yeah baby so hopefully you guys like this video and I'll see you guys

lollipops last week and I thought it would be fun to do some more we're going to be using some watermelon flavor and some fresh lime zest to flavor these I am trying to reach 2,000 subscribers by my birthday in June so if you haven't hit subscribe go ahead and hit that button now and now here's how we're going to make these lollipops the first thing we're going to get started is our candy base I have 133 grams of corn syrup already measured out into my heavy bottom sauce pan because candy making is so precise you want to make sure that you don't waste any of that corn syrup we're then going to add 200 grams of granulated sugar and 75 grams of water we're going to put this on the stove until it reaches 315 degrees Fahrenheit our candy base is heating up on the stove and it's time to prepare our candy making station once this reaches temperature it's going to go really fast so I'm going to explain what we're going to do first we're going to take our hot pan and we're going to place it on a towel on our mat we'll then add our flavorings I have one gram of watermelon flavoring and I have two teaspoons of an unpacked lime zest we're going to pour that into the hot sugar syrup stir it in using a heatproof spatula well then pour that into a heat-safe joke pour our lollipops on to our Silpat mat I'm using my macaron run because it already has about one to one and a half inch circles already on it and that's the size little lollipops I want to make but you can use a piece of parchment paper and set if you like and you can draw the template on the back of them if you want I also have my lollipop sticks ready to go [Music] [Music] [Music] our lollipops are all forward and I got about 16 out of this batch but it depends on how big you make them we're going to let these cool on the trays for about 30 minutes to an hour and then you'll be able to pull them off they'll come off clean and you'll be able to enjoy them well that's it for this episode of the gold TSP I

filling and that baller-ass looking vanilla icing it's big it's very big much bigger than I thought it was going to be it weighs quite a bit it feels quite heavy let's go ahead and give it a bite there's a quality lemon bar mmm good crust get billing good icing no real cannabis taste what to me to speak up at all almost completely devoid of cannabis taste just a good lemon bar um all right guys well I'm gonna enjoy polishing this off and I will see you in two hours or actually I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but I'll be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching Wheaton I'll see you in just a bit peace hi guys it's been Oh actually a little bit longer than two hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw that at this camera", "wSDwefu92VU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary welcome to weeds guys on on today's review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "4h8sTpIMn10": "what's up everybody so this is something I want to say real quick about these way there's another review of doing about about the sweet and sour candies I wanted to do this one these are called watermelon candies and they you know they taste like watermelon varying got very sugar-coated type stuff you know comes with the standard thing they will tell you what kind it is indica oh I forgot the other one was indica - these ones are absolutely delicious these tastings is like watermelons um you can taste the cannabis taste in it but I don't care because medicinally holy crap these are awesome I need about four of them and I was doing pretty good I'm not gonna again again I could ate more and got completely medicated but it was okay um it just proves that these are pretty consistent pretty strong I always kind of liked the small touch this is why I'm talking about this company here I'm not sure where they are um everybody always says the bay but that's probably good chances they're from around the Central Valley or or one of those areas so I just wanted us a quick review on this one is that these are absolutely freakin delicious the watermelon candies I love them additionally they're freakin awesome the ingredients unfortunately the number one ingredient is corn syrup right you know again a lot of these sweets there's not much you can do about that the second one is sugar but the third ingredient is cannabis so that means that's a good thing as this there's more cannabis in this thing then there is a gelatin which is pretty awesome because that's what the mainly made of I'm just supposed to contain about 13 to 15 milligrams per candy I ate I can eat eight five and was doing pretty good again usually when I eat them it's between three and five and that's again if you really wanted to get you know screwed up I guess this is the word for it then seriously medicated then yeah you can get a whole bunch of them and you'd be doing good the consistency is pretty awesome every time we've gotten these is my good these are 30 bucks a bag for this I'm sure through the distributor they don't cost that much but that's usually what the price of going through a co-op is or dispensary but anyways for sure check out this product if your co-op your dispensary has it this is pretty awesome so again share subscribe and do all that other good stuff love a piece of chicken grease", "xtj3v5cex8w": "[Music] and we won't [Music] hey yo everybody how y'all doing outbox house back at it again another new video so this time actually gonna be a little bit different normally you know it's a swags and flour joints i think i smoked like

Bob's medicated cannabis lollipop it's a 40 milligram THC lollipop I'm gonna be your flavored it's a hybrid by the package never had one of these before that everyone told me they're really good it's actually a pretty big lollipop can't really taste the fact that it's medicated which is a big plus for me because I don't really like the Medicaid taste and I got root beer and it really really tastes like root beer so oh no I have to say pretty good review I like it so far stay tuned for more thank you for watching join me on Fort Wayne nurse comm be my fan follow my Instagram", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "Le6Ox7avobQ": "[Music] hi everyone so today I'm gonna show you so I have these three that I got from Canada's mom that's grape flavored hundreds milligrams of THC this is the green apple same thing 100 grand 100 milligrams of THC and then this one is blue raspberry and 100 milligrams of THC so I'm gonna be doing a review today I'm gonna pick one and then I'll review that flavor and whatever and then so on I'll pick another day and I'll do you know grape and then the green apple so today I've decided to go with the the blue raspberry you get all of these a flavor at Canada's mo and I had a feeling that because it's summer and because it's hot I think all the cubes have stuck together so there's the top piece there's this yeah yeah doesn't have a smell but that's how they look so you get four cubes so I'm just gonna put it all in my mouth that's all because I can't even like it would be too hard to even try to break so if you're going to eat these individually they're 25 milligrams of THC per cube let's try I'm not really tasting the blue raspberry yet I'm tasting THC mm-hmm I could teach something but I don't know if it's the blue raspberry just like a little bit of a sweetness but um it's trying to cover the THC but it's not doing a very good job the THC I just coming out I just read in the back here they're from can occur concentrate so that's maybe that's who makes them and Canada does know sells them or I don't know I know that you get these at Ken abysmal they're slowly starting to break off the cubes but yeah I'm not uh not really I'm not really tasting the roster I taste something a little bit sweet but then like the THC is very overpowering I guess you could say so next five o'clock right now I'll come back when these kick in let you know what they're like once it's like usually they're pretty good I've never had a problem never ever had a problem with anything from Canada smell okay so I'm gonna let these dissolve come back when this is kicked in here it is again the medic medicated hard candies Canada's no I'll be back my kicks in okay so I'm back and this is kicked in [Music] what happened was okay so it started to kick in maybe a little bit after 6:00 and I thought well maybe like it's just like this is gonna be it type of thing so what happened was I rolled a joint and smoked it and if you want to see that part you'll have to see watch the video before this one because ed and I are but with making videos like on at the same time so that wasn't a very smart decision for me to smoke the joint but it's it's done stop it I can do now just like sit and wait it out so this is very good stuff I don't really feel like doing anything though like yeah I don't know we just don't feel like doing anything I'm very thirsty and there's no need to smoke a joint just maybe wait the extra five minutes cuz that's what I should have that's what I would have that's what I should have done is wait um maybe the extra five minutes and then I would have been like oh you know what I'm not gonna smoke this drink is here it comes but no there's another don't do what Donna does I'm just drinking coffee because it tastes good right now like it always tastes good but right now it tastes really good and um yeah go ahead go to cannabis mom and get those the hard candies all the packages over there darn it I should have grabbed it maybe I still will keep we'll hang on grab it and go back over there and show the I put my coffee down I don't think that's in the same place but okay this medicated hard candies getting my cannabis no they're good they're very good if you're just starting out then just try the one cube I don't I don't know don't do like more than one but one kit would be good um any any any um like any pains or anything I that I don't feel anything right now it feels good feels good and then at the same time like you don't feel like do anything either so you're not really enjoying it but you are in another way [Music] like I can talk about a lot of things but it probably has nothing to do like I fit you know what today was like the type of day that that like it's like and sort of like in the middle of August and [Music] it wasn't like too hot nor was it like to hold it was just like it was just right and I was just like I don't know like it reminded me of like when I was a kid and stuff that like those days those summer days like that like they were you know you'd be riding your bike or doing whatever like it was just uh it was just like a good day I can't remember those type of days and it was a good day and then at the same time I think like sometimes you get a couple like hot days in August and but then after that cuz like September's coming right and sometimes in September you get really really nice warm days which are okay but um the days like how today was like you know Falls coming and I love fall like I think it's like the best the best season out of all of them I just really love fall so that's what today and I don't know why I'm telling you this but yeah that's what that's what today was like it was like a perfect like temperature-wise day like at the same time like it when you're doing this it's very like real axing and stuff mm-hmm I'm not really hungry at all like it I'm not saying that I won't get hungry but uh hungry at all like so it doesn't really give you the munchies not not Radia way like it's um it's just about seven o'clock so yeah I'd say like the Munchie partly good I don't I don't feel hungry so my eyes feel very heavy though and yours you need a drink always cuz it really dries you out and what else I don't know I like the I like the edibles and then I like joints bonds are okay but like I think edibles are beta bowls and the joints so just are my thing I like to do that stuff because well the edibles like you just eat it and it it's a longer high so whatever reason that you're taking it for you you'll be good for a couple hours which why not and the joints well I just find those easier to inhale yeah I like to just smoke a joint it's okay and to do a bong thing like you're a bong toke I don't know what just I can't get it all in so like that's why they like I like the joints but like if I have to I can do the bong toes it just takes a little bit more or longer to the whole process type thing [Music] know what to say I can't know what to talk about I just don't know what to tell you guys like should I say this and I can probably know it's open I feel really good though this is this is a nice side this is a nice feeling I'm [Music] like I'm not paranoid like if somebody knocked on the door then I would be like oh [ __ ] even though there's nothing even to smell I would just be paranoid because how am I going to say to somebody like how am I even gonna talk to somebody because like my eyes you could just [ __ ] tell but you know you just know like I couldn't say oh no I have somebody's I don't want you I and I'd be like oh no like [ __ ] you can't even I can't even say that so yes if somebody was knocking at the door I I would get a little bit worried about that but otherwise it'll is like I wasn't that or whatever like I'm I'm okay I I just feel really good and relaxed and um it's just stuff that like if it makes you feel that relaxed that you kind of wish that you were sitting on a dock and just looking out there onto the water like you were just looking that's what or if you're like sitting on a dog and it was like either you know you were watching the Sun Rise or you know if you're watching inside today it's that kind of relaxing relaxed feeling and it goes well with coffee this this is what you feel and it feels like it feels like that except I'm not sitting on the dock watching the Sun set or rise up so but anyways that's what it makes you you feel like well sons like Hannah over there but it's not setting yet this I'll already be done this before it even said so those annoys I don't know if you can hear them you know those buzzing noises I think it's crickets or something or some type of insect you know that highlight noise that you hear but I remember I was a kid I don't know if you can hear her anyways as a kid because um like Killarney is not that big of a place so there's like lots of bush and stuff and and there's like little trails and stuff like that so like if you're out playing with your friends and then you guys decided to go on this trail and or go whatever into the long grass or whatever like stuff like that ain't always you'd get further out there and you can hear those buzzing those I don't know what insect that is and often sit like a cricket or oh I don't know what it is but so anyways when I hear that stuff that reminds you know I was a kid it's funny how like I don't know if it's like a 40 thing or it's gotta be maybe like 40 high and in your 40s or something and like when you think of like certain uh sound not yeah like sounds are like just certain things and you think like way but like when you were a kid and it seems like it was a long freaking time ago like it's not like you know when you know when you're 20 and you go yeah when I was a kid well when you that wasn't you know you're still kind of our kid at 20 but if 40s yeah it makes things seem a long time ago when maybe because if it is a long time ago or maybe because you just feel like that cuz like 40 years though that's that's pretty long I'm going to have to go make another coffee soon because I'm just about done this one and I need to like this bad has to be he liked me because I took everything off and washed it and [ __ ] I just don't feel like doing it no but it has to be done just like it just seems like it's gonna be a like a Wyatt like a couple minute job ooh yeah I was gonna turn into like this you know Ted minitor probably like 10 to 15 minutes to make this bad like that's I should have made it before or like while I was eating the edibles I should have made it then because they would have been done in a couple minutes now the only thing I have done is like I put the pillowcases on the on the pillows like the sheets and stuff are here but like the what is it like the mattress protector thing like I wash side and that's dried and everything else but hmm after you'll get that on the line on the clothesline so I was like go down and get that come back put that on and then put the sheets on and like and you gotta put like the blanket and comforter part so I'm really not looking forward to that but you know why I think um I I think I just need some more coffee and they need to just go sit down and you just think a little um I think that's it like I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna enjoy it that's time I was you know worries about anything unless somebody knows so let's that's my review on it skid here's the package and get it at can abismo that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "nUlkBjwEBsc": "yo what is up guys that playing togar back here again welcome to another video man we're back filming back on my phone instead of the iPad my iPad is kind of [ __ ] out right now so it's whatever I can stick with the phone I like it a little bit better anyway west of the hassle so today's video guys I got a edible review my favorite edible it's the flavor X watermelon sour belt well they're not called sour belt but it's just built this is the packaging I would show you that apples inside and everything but I kind of ate it all and I'm just going to give you my experience and my review and should you get it get should you even you know try it out but before we start off the video man I do have a bowl loaded so I got some alien OGE loaded up we're gonna be using my big bong cuz the bubblers dirty and plus I keep knocking it over [ __ ] annoying but this is the only no G already took a bat rip and I put some fresh stuff on top but hopefully you guys are gonna be smoking along with me I was going to get hit on my babe but not today man so anyhow guys hopefully you're having a good day and yeah let's get this video started with uh take this first hit and hopefully you guys are smoking along with me if so let me know what you're smoking on cuz I'm always curious to know what you guys are smoking on um while watching the video and let's get dis sesh started man so Cheers so yeah guys so today we're gonna be reviewing the flavor X watermelon belt this is a 250 milligram package it contains with 10 belts each belt is 25 milligrams each and to tell you the truth it had really good taste really sweet it was a bit sour at times but one of the better gummies that I've tried and the California cannabis market like there but yeah man [ __ ] almost aired out here for a second but flavor axe is a San Diego company and I do live in San Diego so it's pretty cool hometown company at least that's what I was told Dendi the research but I know they do have a production factory down um down in San Diego though so you know I don't I don't know if they started up in San Diego that they do you have a factory here um and yeah guys like honestly best best tasting gummies didn't taste like cannabis at all like super sweet but it tastes exactly like watermelons didn't taste anything else I didn't get any weed back taste to it or anything like that um I I had to like the downfall though but like the downfall to it I had to eat a half a bag to really feel something but my tolerance is pretty high cuz I do smoke every day and I do eat edibles on more than a couple of times a week so I do have a pretty high tolerance so um if you're like a rookie like looking in on this like don't eat have the don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know cuz you'll be [ __ ] throwing up and you're gonna be regretting it and you wouldn't like edibles at all like you want in try it and try one again after experiencing a edible overdose it's really shitty it's happened to my mom a couple of times funny enough but uh but yeah I don't don't be that a don't be that a smart guy that chased you uh eat half the bag or the whole bag and just think oh don't feel anything okay do not do not be a [ __ ] like that man that's all I got to say but yeah man like I really do recommend this product this is like a really shorter like video I guess not really but yeah like I read into everything like this time around I read the packaging there they are lab tested and they do follow the new guidelines for the edibles if you're an outsider that's not in California if you don't know what I'm talking about back last month June not July 10th or July 1st they passed a new law which is like the new phase going into the recreational and medical market for the cannabis market here in California everything has to be free packaged everything has to be lab tested and yeah there it's much stricter like compared to like Oregon like I see origin like they so have like they're so using the pill bottles now it's in fanciest jars and they give you in the legal dispensaries anyhow they give you a smelly proof bag and everything and it's child locked it's to prevent kids from it's to prevent [ __ ] the kids getting into the [ __ ] my cat [ __ ] tried to pop in the video popped in the video again so sorry about that but a dude come on this she's a dick anyhow yeah so it's really different here I've been kind of looking into like other states and stuff not really finding anything but just like comparing but it really does seem like California's a lot stricter with the whole marijuana thing compared to everywhere where else but yeah man honestly I'm gonna have to give the edibles a 5 out of 5 I'm sorry for kind of rambling on about the whole California cannabis market but I just to give you guys insight of like what's different and hopefully you guys learned something new about it if you're you were interested in knowing how the market was here but five out of five I would get them again and it was only 20 bucks - I did not mention that I only paid twenty [ __ ] bucks for this and hell yeah I would pay for it again cuz it's cheap I don't mind paying twenty bucks or something that gets me [ __ ] up like I'm pretty sure if I take like a month off like tolerance break man and and I eat least like I'm pretty sure like a half half a belt would get me pretty ripped but I do have a high tolerance and I don't know when the next time I'm going to be taking a tolerance break to be honest but but yeah guys I'm going to take one more rip and be out of the way the next video is going to be string review of alien og I might have that out later today or probably tomorrow which is I'm recording this video on Friday the 24th so the 25th tomorrow you'll get the video and if you have it already man make sure to click on the post notifications because I do post every Monday Wednesday and Friday and I occasionally do upload on Saturdays Saturdays can be like more of like

bong rip [Music] do you guys have a problem always losing your lighters when um when you're baked or just in general because I have the biggest problem and always lose mine let me know down in the

don't", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please

up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next

in the 90s when I worked for a restoration company and I worked with a lot of Hispanic guys and this this is what they introduced me to these are the bureau mango suckers from the grupo Bimbo company yeah they got me they got me anything and and I I used to after they got me hooked on these things I used to like go by on myself at the Merc and eat those little Mexican market that's for you that's where you find him and you get good prices there you know then when I worked at the same time I worked for the restoration company we would we went on a on a job that that we ended up going over to Texas and and when we was in Texas we were close to the Mexican border so we went across the board and went to a little a little store over there and yeah screaming big bag big bag to these things for for really really cheap prices and how about private three or four bags of them took him back to sorry took him back home and I had a little office and I would had a little store going myself in there and I would sell you know energy drink soda pops suckers and all kinds other candies and stuff and it was kind of a convenient thing for all the guys to they you know they would come over to my office and I would sell him an energy drink a cold coffee like the frappuccinos and stuff like that and I would take the money and I would go buy more stuff and I'd make a little bit of a profit it wasn't nothing big but it was a fun little thing plus the guys had something had resources they could just come to me and get something you know and I had you know had a little refrigerator in my office and I kept a stop with soda pops of stuff but oh yeah these little suckers these little bureau mangrove suckers are like I said I carried this thing with me all the time on jobs and stuff at first you

of a dark brown color that's kind of shy see the shininess got that it's probably the what they just you know you know the candies probably wet of course when they put that chili powder on there but usually makes me cough you got to get through the chili powder first get to the candy but look good me and to you gotta like chili bother the ball so it's not gravity and like a 12 pack or something like that with these things actually might not been that mean but so I've been you know trying to link them with what we're using stuff as I've juiced up 8.5% ABV let's clear this vido mango with that with this wheel Wow that's pretty good that's pretty good they got other stuff to that store getting better hmm you can get these in other other forms other kinds they make them and make this one that you like give you a little packet or chili powder and then the sucker and you can dip it in it and then lick it up the they like a thick coat of the chili powder it's coming off somewhat it's getting down to the candy you get a little bit of sweetness with it now put it you know see dip the strong chili powder is gone it doesn't heat up just a little bit left the lighter stuff that's but yeah these are good if you see these and you like chili powder and like these kind of things pick them up if you've never tried it before well good [Applause] [Applause] very good all right well I'm gonna

something like that um very sour it's gonna bite this thing hmm good sweetness coming through now really good there's like a mango sweetness to it underneath this tastes like a pilot ah shot if you guys have ever had a pauletta shop this is what it tastes like this is probably where they got it from mmm good stuff the spicy sourness on the outside really complements that mango mmm it's just it's pretty sour for me so that's why I bite it cuz I like a little bit of the sweetness with the sour the other way you're gonna have to wait for all the sour and spicy to go away before you start tasting the mango maybe I just I'm impatient I don't know who out there you just lick the lollipop suck on it or do you bite the lollipop let me know in the comments below as you can see I bit it cuz I can't

looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "Fz2jOxna0PQ": "everyone so occasionally when I try different drinks and stuff they've been given to me about this kid I work with at the theater named Brad who speaks in nothing but homoerotic double entendres so he comes into work one day he's like hey Dave I've got a set just full of something for you to suck I'm like Brad no please no and he whips out this gallon size like ziploc bag full of all these Mexican candies and he's like don't worry Dave don't worry I've got something nice and spicy and you're gonna suck on it all night long I'm like oh god I have to report a charm I have to report you but but then he finally presents what he wants me to try which is a Mexican watermelon flavored lollipop with chili powder on it knowing that I like spicy things there was one day where if you saw my one chip challenge right I'd three of them I had two chips left one of them I gave to my friend Stephen who used to work at the theaters he wanted to follow her try it and the other one I brought into the theater and the kids who work there kind of like broken up into pieces and they all tried like little pieces of one and the results were pretty funny but I'm not gonna post that one um so this is from Reba adidas I'm sure I'm butchering that horribly but this is kind of what the the rapper or the lollipop looks like it's wrapped because I would never accept anything unwrapped or opened from bread after knowing what he does with Gatorade bottles and you don't want to know that story I think that get me demonetized and so um been trying out a few J of artificial like candy ordered on the flavor but I'm okay with it um I'm thinking this might taste like um someone I work with my other job or used to wear these to be one of my employees before I get promoted um they had something called like tagine or two it was kind of like a um like spice or something that's people sometimes put on watermelon slices I have actual I'm fairly certain that when I went to Epcot and I went to LaCava Delta Kela in Epcot great place recommend it I had um I had two jalapeno margaritas in the rim I think was of that touching stuff I don't know if that I found saying it right but it's something like that I've looked for it in the grocery store and I haven't found it yeah they're probably to go to one of the ethnic ones so I'm wondering if it'll end up tasting like that where it's kind of sweet but still with a little bit of a kick it so it's almost more like a chili sugar rim than actual like spice but oh I'm gonna try this now this is a lollipop and regardless of what Brad was saying with this double entendres I do have to suck it so I was wondering it how exactly do I try this on camera without it looking weird like I don't think you want me like staring right into the camera and sucking it deeply yeah like I think that would be a little too much for her YouTube and also I don't I have like Brad will immediately give this and put it on the discord let the other kids above the heirs use this so I'm not sure I want to do that so I'm gonna try and make this as least Felicio looking as possible when I try this so here's what it looks like without the wrapper if it'll focus on a trip up the lighting on here will let you see but there's a decent amount of what looks like the spice on it weird that it's not like a perfect round or anything and there's some spice on the the handle here but uh let's see how it is and again I'll try to make this not as awkward for you and or as awkward for me as this could be okay that doesn't taste like watermelon or chili that that tastes the way a basement smells and I don't I don't know how old this is I mean I have been holding on to it for a couple weeks um so maybe that's it but yeah mostly just tastes dank kind of smells like that too let me try it again should i I'll cover my mouth to prevent dipping all right I'm getting down to some of the tartness now um so I'm kind of getting to watermelon taste it's just that the chili powder on it it's not spicy but it's adding something like I'm not just tasting pure like tart watermelon yeah it's not like sour watermelon I there it's not like that's like the watermelon sour patch kids or anything but yeah the first taste that entered my mouth was like this is the smell of like an antique store it's so antique store candy that's that's interesting um man I don't you know it makes you make this a bit more entertaining maybe I'll block my mouth with some more Kyle McLaughlin let's see yeah I can't quite place what the flavour is now that it's gotten past the antique store taste well I still kind of taste the antique store a little bit um but um there's like there's a decent like Pleasant tartness under it but that's in the but that's like the under taste like the surface taste what is the surface taste I'm trying to figure that out well okay I can't figure out what that first taste is it's um it's it's not unpleasant it's like it's not like bad or disgusting or anything like that um but I can't figure out what it is cuz it doesn't it doesn't taste much like chili powder I mean I know it is chili powder but I guess that mixed with the the lollipop underneath cuz I don't even really taste watermelon a it just tastes tartness um but there's I can't really place it but it's I mean this isn't something I'd have again it's not really something I'd recommend but it's it's kind of curious like cuz it's not what I expected I thought maybe this would taste like you know like capsaicin or spiciness like um like when you put any sort of like jalapeno powder or something like that on there and I know chili powder normally isn't as spicy as that kind of stuff but I figured it'd be sort of like a spicy kick with tartness underneath but it's not least spicy on top it's something else and I can't quite place it so sorry I can't quite describe what this tastes like um and now I know I kind of want a lollipop that is covered in tagine or even like one that's covered in not habanero powder probably be too much for a lollipop but certainly jalapeno powder or um something that has a little capsaicin on it would mix with the sweetness pretty well so I know it's kind of disappointing I guess I was hoping for more I mean I was also thinking that maybe it was just sort of like when you have like Sour Patch Kid thing there's like a layer of the stuff on top of it and then you get to the gummy pretty quickly it looks like this is like a bit more Interlochen with the candy so you probably get the chilli powder all the way through all right one more try for this to see if I can describe it I can't it's just I would just say it's tartness I mean there's a couple parts like at the bottom or on the side here where there's not as much powder and that I can actually taste I can actually start to taste watermelon under it like you know like general like watermelon candy um but the I I just can't figure out what the chilli powder mixed on top of it tastes like but yeah I mean the first the first taste was the way an attic or a antique store smells like but then beyond that it was just sort of an indescribable top flavor with just nothing but tartness underneath but that doesn't even quite taste like watermelon so uh I can't quite recommend it not I don't know I'm not even gonna finish it I'm pretty much stopping here so um you know that was the lollipop and I assume Brad's gonna keep presenting me with more things with pseudo sexual banter until I finally leave the theater and", "vlLo3VBV9X8": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness I'm chef Scott and this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we sometimes cook things and sometimes we no but at least once a week I eat some edibles from one of our Washington state dispensaries something that I wouldn't make in the house something that's probably more industrial then I might have the tools to do so we're gonna get started right away with today's friendly panda candies by hot sugar hot sugar is a subsidiary company of the fact and a company you need to go to their website fat Panda there that's fun I've already eaten a few of these these are our Panda candies these are the caramel apple flavor they have a bunch of flavors many many many not for kids this is THC infused tetrahydrocannabinol okay I'm not sure what the regulation is because this is a really new package as a matter of fact this package that you see is a redesign of the package WIC in the past I don't know six months but this is a new look whichever I like it's really aggressive in there I like that but this package doesn't have any of the nutritional values of anything whereas some of the other ones really do they have act it looks like you bought it at the grocery store it's got all the nutrition and the sodium and the all the stuff so I'm not really sure it must be a voluntary kind of a thing I wish cannabis companies are you listening please put the nutritional values on your products you see these words how tiny can you see the tiniest words ever so I wrote them down over here so he's sharing with you easier I'm gonna read some stuff here and you'll be able to tell from my face how I feel about any of it okay the following pesticides have been used to grow the cannabis that helped create this product Newcomb botan Agard max safer brand three-in-one liquid sulfur Zehra tall regalia PTO gannett role and as a guard which I think sounds like a place that Thor lives as a guard as a guard anyway that's one two three four five six seven eight different pesticides used on the cannabis on the flower the stem portion that's a lot of pesticides in Washington State you have to declare what pesticides are used if any so we have some other companies that we use a lot of flour from that are organic the cannabis was extracted using a proprietary blend of hydrocarbons winterized with ethanol and then molecularly distilled leaving no residual solvents I don't know what any of those words mean but it is forcing me to believe it sweetie okay all of these words are printed on that little half inch tall paragraph okay this is not necessary here are your ingredients today isomalt we're gonna talk about that in a minute pure cane sugar corn syrup vanilla beans cannabis can't can't cannabis oil propyl paraben artificial flavor with the brown color which is six colors like a [ __ ] Crayola box okay corn starch vegetable gum citric acid sodium benzoate potassium sorbate potassium sorbet really caramel flavor and a natto and a natto is just like a it's a vegetable color it's no problem isomalt let's talk about that that's the number one ingredient in this product isomalt is a sugar alcohol and if you're not a baker if you don't work in the food industry you may not know what it is if you go to Vegas or you go to some fancy place and they have those big gorgeous sugar sculptures and it's just tall and beautiful and sculptural and architectural that's made with isomalt sugar real sugar your table sugar that you guys are using right now is known as hydro scopic that means it pulls all of the water near it to it that's why if you leave should sometimes it'll get all mushy especially you live in Florida it'll get all I mean you can you know I mean I so melt on the other hand is not so in the pebbles candies they use pure sugar and corn syrup and those candies as they melt in your mouth they become pliable and kind of bendy isomalt does not these candies do not ever become bendy they get smaller smaller smaller smaller until I usually get bored with them and crunch them to death which is probably terrible for my teeth but I do it anyway because I have no control isomalt is really low on the glycemic index that means that it does not trigger an insulin response so it is not as sweet as real sugar but you can use it like real sugar it is granulated and it melts like sugar it acts exactly like sugar it is not hydroscopic so it's very firm that's why they use it you know to make stuff there is a national prohibition on cannabis so companies that operate in Washington state that also want to operate in other states or want to have their product in other states have to open separate companies separate facilities separate grow houses all separate if they want to for example fat Panda is the company that it originated here and it is also you can get it in count in Canada they have fat panda in Canada as well and here and I guess just recently in California what I but it's coming soon to Oregon Michigan Ohio West Virginia Florida Arizona Nevada and more to come caramel apple delicious first of all you get a sticker whose love a sticker [Music] all right I got this is what they look like this is ten milligrams of THC this is a caramel apple caramel apple flavor I like these because they're stupid packages really weak it's supposed to be childproof but clamp doesn't seem like it yeah [Music] but the flavor you guys super flavorful also the distillate that they're using is really front like I can really I can feel it on my tongue yeah it's really good hmm yeah yummy that was really nice okay I promise to set this one okay I promise chimera Lamia I will zoom it [ __ ] [Music] so the Panda can be worked I already know worked I didn't worked but it really works good so let's do a little let's do a little test now let's see I'm gonna mix these up these are some of my tarot cards I will do a little tarot card reading for you right now mmm tarot cards so special so maybe tippy do so magical oh so controversial pick a card any card to pick a card one pick it for you let's talk about this dope shall we oh my god yeah so these Panda candies I don't know what they're using how it works this the strength of the stuff if you call a few episodes ago I told you it's 10 milligrams per candy but they don't tell you what strain they've used or how strong that strain is so 10 milligrams of one kind of weed can be really much stronger than 10 milligrams of another kind of weed seriously the way they make these I feel them almost immediately this is one of the only candies is one of the few candies that really just I seriously I feel it within 30 minutes two or three of these are some kind of strong ass [ __ ] okay so on my scale let's give him four tastes an eight I'm gonna give him a 7 they have you can really taste the distillate and I mean the caramel apple flavor is good but you can still really it gets overpowered so a7 what I say think of it 7 and for efficacy a 9 and for price an 8 they were good plus no my Wizards discount love that ok so we've picked a card you picked a card - Jeff you picked a card this would be 10 of cups the 10 of cups now if you don't follow Tarot this is a great card oh gosh so family unit everybody's happy they got everything they need often the distance is their house it symbolizes family and stability and the river of emotions flowing through the promise from the divine through the the rainbow everything's gonna be fine so hold tight you guys find the people you love if you're not close to call them and it's gonna be fine we'll be fine see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "rurxyJ4iqTA": "[Music] friends welcome back we are doing another mexican candy tasting today and actually most of these were gifted to me by gracie at work who brought them and so i'm so thankful thank you gracie i'm excited because uh some of them sound or seem sound they are familiar looking to me because i've seen them in the markets but i've never tried most of them and then we're going to be revisiting the slaps again because i've done a little homework i've gotten a lot of good comments on this video and we're going to be revisiting how to properly eat them so stay tuned so let's just dive in here there's a couple that is familiar so vero elotes so elotes are the grilled corn that you usually see with mayonnaise and then tajin and cotija cheese and esquite is when it is in a cup so off the cob so i do know that i do love elotes so much but this is a candy version episode i don't i don't know what that means so i have had one of these before and we're just gonna try everything and then i'll probably go revisit them after i'm done filming but this is a sucker and it looks like a corn on the cob it looks like there is some good tajin on there or some kind of a chili something it smells spicy and it is spicy hmm i've had these before so once you get through the spice part it's just a really good flavorful sucker well revisit that but i do enjoy these quite a lot one of the things that i've learned from moving up here is that the sweet and the spicy and the salty go so well together and i don't think i've ever really dived in to that flavor combination until i moved here but i'm loving it okay this is something new i had to wrap it up because it's a little sticky this is something new for me i have seen these she gave me a couple of them but they are these spoons that have i believe gracie says if it's tamarind in there i think but i have seen these in all the markets and i feel like it's going to be spicy i feel like it's going to be spicy but we'll see so that one came with two and then there's like this oh is it like a wax paper plasticky oh she's sticky [Music] okay so it comes on a spoon like that i just pulled off this plastic part it doesn't smell like much i wonder if it's chewy sticky for sure do i just put the whole thing in do i bite it oh it's um it's think of very granulated sugar that is a little sticky and it's a little chilly very very light chili it's more tamarind flavor but i feel like there is a little heat in there very easy to chew but oh that's good but i think it's just straight sugar with tamarind flavor or just tamarind mmm that's good that's not hot i mean there's a little kick to it but it's not like burn your mouth off or anything like that so i don't know what truth means but with um lime and salt i do know that they look like they're probably going to be uh maybe a corn chip of some sort maybe like a tacky they just smell oh that's a big one should we just do it they don't smell like much hmm oh you know what these taste like so they're like these little tubes i would assume that they're corn based but they almost taste like those uh sesame sticks that you get in asian snacks too but then it's got a lime component and a salt component but no spice component those are good those are good they're just crunchy a little limey i feel like there's like a little sesame flavor to it maybe that's corn i'm getting sesame these taste like the sesame snacks from asian snack packs but just with a lime and salt flavor that's good a lot of suckers so this one um i mean it's got a watermelon on there it does not look it says normal i don't know what that means it does not look like it's going to be spicy whatsoever really cute look at that [Music] coloring that's good it tastes like watermelon bubblicious not spicy whatsoever that is delicious nice artificial watermelon flavor which i love this one so mandy at work got some and so i traded her some for things that i hadn't tried like this one it looks like a high five sucker monita de la suerte [Music] it is a high five i love that i hope it's tasty i would just assume because of the bubblicious looking pink that it's going to be bubblegum flavor but it could be cherry too and it says something on here but it's kind of like see that i can't really see it panda una banda something um that's awesome it's um i think it's cherry we're gonna call it cherry it's cherry to me strawberry maybe strawberry it's good though again just sweet no spicy component to this one [Music] that one's good too let's see this is one i've always seen but i've never tried mostly because you have to buy everything in um larger quantity than just one so there's a couple markets here that will let you that just have these loose and have the candies loose but a lot of times you have to buy quite a few of them so this is salt and lemon powder limon 7 pulvo de sally limon must be powder i don't i think you just eat this or do you like putting beer and of course i don't have any scissors oh here we go i think you got to be smarter than the packaging nicole well we're gonna have to go get some tools for that one you wanna just wait okay oops sorry and it looks like just powder i would show you but then i would dump it everywhere i'm sure this is candy you have to mix it up or something oh my god it's like um i don't know i'm sticking my tongue in it but it's lemon flavored salt lime flavored salt what do you do with this do you is this for a beer this is not candy is it why would anyone just eat this as candy you have to be do is this for tequila here's me looking over to the alcohol cabinet like is there tequila available um that would be delicious in with like you know licking shooting whatever um i'm not gonna call this candy maybe it is can someone for me but it's it's good it's a lemon lime flavored salt but uh in this candy haul i'm a little confused but that's fine what else is new okay the last two things need this little spoodle spatula i call them spoodles uh i have had this i haven't had this flavor this is the neapolitan flavor which is the vanilla strawberry chocolate i've had the chocolate hazelnut version which is basically nutella so this is a duvalin try sabor three flavors but this is basically just a little dish of frosting and i think you all know how i feel about frosting oh and it smells like neapolitan ice cream so which i'm a fan of fun fact funny thing is i do not like fruit and chocolate but in neapolitan i i'm totally fine with it but i feel like i should try each of these flavors separate just for the sake of this review so we're going in with the vanilla [Music] good vanilla frosting here's the strawberry oh wait is it not strawberry vanilla yeah freesia is fresa fresa that's strawberry right and chop yeah chocolate i'm confused maybe i'm just not getting enough of it hold on going in with a big bite of strawberry i can't tell a difference guys but it is different than the other two so there's that but could i tell you that it was strawberry no all right now we're gonna try a scoop of every flavor on the spoodle delicious this would actually be good to dip pretzels in yeah you should try that that's delicious again it's tough to find those uh where you can buy them in just single versions okay this is probably the one that i am most interested by it's called dulces carla gracie said that it's tamarind but how cute is that oh god oh it touched my nose okay okay it smells i need to take this food on my hold on it smells like straight up tamarind it is um what it wait what it what if this is the same stuff that's on the spoon but the spoon is just like hardened a little bit maybe it looks like it's the same stuff but it's just this one's more like liquidy smells like tamarind hold on this one has chili in it okay you know when you're like ready for something you you're pretty sure you know what it is and then it's not but it's good though i guess i could have read here as a car sugar glucosa sugar agua water chili in pulveo so that must mean chili powder sal aceto citrico i should have known this is good though wow it's still got that granulated texture really easy to chew though harley's on guard that's good guys [Music] i like this better than the spoon because it does have that kick the one that i wasn't prepared for this is delicious this is one where i mean i can't see myself sitting here and eating this whole little tub of it but for a little sugar pick-me-up with a little kick that's delicious i would say oh the things that gracie gave me i very much liked this high five sucker the frog steamed the duvelin was good this is delicious and this is the unsuspected really enjoyable one so thank you gracie now i do have a couple other things that i have that i want to try on here uh almond caramel almendra ah almendra almendra gara pinata good thing i have these scissors here huh and i'm guessing that these are just caramel or toffee almonds they smell delicious they're smell sweet crunchy hmm my nose is raining a little bit from that chili okay so we all know that caramel is just sugar that's been cooked but does this taste like caramel no this tastes like almonds that are covered in sugar which is totally fine but what i call them caramel almonds probably not but that is good what if they were a little bit more butter toffee-ish that would be delicious but they're not but this is still really good i found this at a gas station where i got the slaps so okay we know that these come we know that number one we know that they're very tasty right we also know the scissors nicole we also know that they come in a four pack and that the red is fruit punch and the yellow is pineapple pina now the last time that we had these i had no idea what was going on with them so we ate them a couple of different ways and a couple of my viewers were kind enough to tell me i was doing it wrong which is totally fine so i did some research and we're here again so here is the slap it is comes on this piece of plastic and okay this is the sticky side here's what we're gonna do we are going to take this and we're gonna fold it down sticky side in so it will stick on itself okay and we're gonna press it so it sticks lots of research has gone into the skies and then we're going to pull this up and see how it's folded over on itself and then we're going to do it again and word on the street is that the smaller you can get it the better like if you can fold it over again which we'll try no promises here so then again you pull it up and it's stuck on itself again and then we're gonna push it over just one more time because the stick obviously and then so you get to this point and then you fold it over on itself this way and you fold it over on itself this way again and then pull it off the plastic and oh this is so good however i also like so i should finish the thought first time that's delicious however this one came with five or is there five in the other one do i also think that there is beauty in eating it oh this one's not gonna pull off okay hold on eating it just off of the plastic like this and the answer is yes yes still delicious i love that stick but it's not too sticky so the proper way the nicole way these are delicious so one more time here just because i looked into it and i'm very happy that i did we'll do it with the red this time so you got your sticky side out or you still have the plastic on it good job okay sticky side we're gonna fold it once and the plastic here helps for those of us who don't like to get our hands very messy so you don't have to and we're going to fold it again and then we're gonna fold in the sides and we're gonna fold in the other side i am available for parties guys anyways that's my mexican candy haul and another the proper way to eat a slap thanks for joining gracie thank you so much for bringing these dulces into me i very much liked it and i was very pleasantly shocked by this one so thank you for sharing and i'll see you guys next time bye", "MGU9R3q9sHQ": "[Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "QM9IwIoHC6I": "hey guys Millie and today I'm going to be turning this creme de la creme a um it's the watermelon cream oh I got it from this guy at my school on his name's case he dropped each game everyone in the classroom and I know that a lot of people don't like this and I know a lot of people don't like the watermelon in cream I got the peaches and cream but yeah i'm just going to be trying the watermelon and cream so what would that be and be right there so I'm going to try open this ok why won't you hold it still while open ok I'm going to try to pick my nail in it while it worth ok startin to open mic right here I don't smell anything and it looks like a falling apart it's really really crack hey so I know um anyway I heard a lot of bad things about his favor and heard that it was gross and taste like throw up so this is the cream par and as you could probably tell it to the water on her not to add the cream ruins the entire thing what my captain do me me ok so now I'm sitting in the finger but tastes like warm them and then the cream piece makes it a psych grow up it reminds me of something I just saw off my piano it reminds me of something I just don't know what the bacon come here there goodbye home with David what does it remind you of to taste the cream makes it mite tired yeah I reminds me of something hostage sweet yes natural the edge in case I cross and slate yeah he was really bad positively excite

more often and so yeah have a good day bye", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you

milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep

you're doing your Zumba workout I'm worried that I'm gonna buy like five different types of candy that all turned out to be the same thing because they all have tamarind in them okay everybody time for breakfast I'm excited okay I have to say the candy that looks the most exciting to me is squink 'el salsa getti this looks amazing yes so this is like a gummy string candy it's apparently watermelon flavored it's got these little chips on it of salsa let's try it mmm I like it it tastes like watermelon but it's not really that spicy in fact I wouldn't say this is spicy at all this just tastes sweet with like a little bit of a flaky coating but the coating doesn't really have a taste just good how was this oh we've got two packets of flavored hot liquid candy that came in the container which I suppose I was supposed to put on top this might be what makes it hot you know what I'm gonna save one is just in case I want it without the hot sauce later okay that that's gonna be hot I'll just do it like this yet again not as spicy as I was hoping I like the watermelon flavor though grab some napkins my hands gonna get all sticky today we'll try something else hot this is a hot tamarind fall oh wow I think when I tried Filipino food the other time there was something similar to this but it was sweet okay so it's a little spicy Oh a lot spicy yeah okay this one is real this one's a real deal the texture is kind of sandy and it's like a sandy dried fruit and a pet burger met and became lovers and that was their baby there's something not spicy here I could eat I'm gonna go with this ah Pepito yeah it's quite sticky smells pretty sweet there's a bunch of sesame seeds that have been brought together by sweetness I like this one caramel coating for apples I'm now starting to wonder if I should have bought an apple to put this on with the Zumba okay hey I'm the Apple it's like a little hat for the Apple house open Mexico I must you make everything so complicated to open oh come on Mexico make it easy on me okay well there's a there's what it doesn't smell hot or anything think about my nose all right let's try it ah peanut caramel jumbo it does seem like there might be a spicy element to it I'm a huge fan of these I like these a lot here's another peanut delicacy these are Japanese style peanuts burritos a mango mango burritos um it's almost like a fruit roll-up the way that the texture is yes totally like that I'm liking the fruit snack with a little bit of a spicy coating thing that they've got going on Alfa's your take cocoa tamarind pineapple and watermelon flavored el chavo let's try it yellow oh it's like a jelly bean or that must be the tamarins okay these are pure sugar maybe a light sugar and artificial flavors you're gonna

I'm sorry Oh again if you like that really hot flavor you'll love it thanks for joining me while I tried Mexican candy in conclusion Mexico I really like your nut tend more nuts you", "Xr5Y9wIOR1M": "[Music] hi there welcome to stated his kitchen today I am SuperDuper duper excited because I'm going to show you my best ever recipe which I absolutely love to make I'm showing you how to make my bubblegum flavored lollipops kids absolutely adore eating them but adults have to make them so let's get started get yourself a nice heavy base small pan and in that put 225 grams of glucose syrup I put it in already on top of that you need to put 450 grams of granulated sugar and on top of that 80 mil of cold water now I want to turn on your hob to medium-high and I'm just very gently very very very gently just going to stir in the glucose syrup so it doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan now get a lid and pop it on and set your timer for about four minutes what you want is to self clean aside so everything now is going to bubble up the steam is going to take the sugar off the sides and self-clean the sides so there won't be any crystallization of the sugar the most important thing about making these lollipops is that everything has to be ready before you start so that when your sugar is ready to pour you are ready to you need to get yourself loli molds and lolly sticks I definitely prefer plastic lolly sticks than wooden ones it's important to have a sugar thermometer because you're lonely pops have to get up to 154 degrees we've got ice water here ready to plunge the pan into when the temperature reaches 154 degrees we've got all of sprinkles ready and also all of our flavorings ready they go sugars now bubbling away nicely and the sides are perfectly clean it's probably going to take around ten minutes to get up 254 degrees the hard crack stage at this point you want to keep your fingers well away from this sugar syrup it would not be funny if it goes on your fingers and also if you've got children around make sure you put it on the hob over here 154 we're stopping now okay we're plunging it I've got to plunge it straight into the straight into the ice water because you want to stop the sugar immediately 1:54 you want to stop it immediately from cooking very gently move it around sorry it so important not to let any of the water go into the sugar syrup at this point if you're experienced at lolli making you can pour it directly into the molds but I think it's best for us if you pour it straight into a jug I'll put this in me and the sink I'm putting a strange thing with some hot water in it for this otherwise it'll stick to the sides it'll be a nightmare to get off later so if you put into a jars and then put some hot water in your pan it's gonna make the clear-up process a lot lot easier now it's time to put in your food flavoring um I've decided to use bubble gum today because it's absolutely the children's favorite but there are so many different ones you can choose from in my box I have great watermelon candy floss strawberry coca-cola banana I mean the list is endless today it's bubble gum and in a jug of this size you probably need about 10 tiny drops 1 and then just leave it for a little bit and before you know it the whole thing the whole room is going to smell a bubble gum and it's delightful wait for the bubbles to to subside a little bit and that's time to start your pouring you ready okay be very very very gentle very very very very careful want to take it up just to the top covering your sticks a nice stream going slide it over these little bits here just crossed that they crust up and they could just be peeled off at the end should always try and make lollipops when the weather is quite cold is a perfect time of year for lollipops if it's summer and it's humid it's very very difficult to make lollies because they go with sticky and disgusting let's see if I can try and get another one once it starts getting a little bit thicker if you've got it in a jug like this you could pop the jug in the microwave just until it starts bubbling and then you can reuse it okay to make sure every stick is in correctly now I'm gonna pop this in the microwave for about 10 let's just finish them off so I've managed to get eleven out of that mouth sugar if you wanted to double it and do double the amount of sugar and double them up glucose syrup that's also fine it's now time to decorate you need to it's a little bit of practice this takes a little bit of trial and error because you obviously can't touch your sugar but you need to know when the right time is to put the sprinkles on because if we put the sprinkles on too early but what happen is the heat will just make them melt but you know what it will take a little bit of time but I think these are probably ready now I'm gonna use some of these gorgeous embellishments they're just sugar embellishments and you can pop them on your lollipops and they make them look absolutely fabulous be very very careful when you put them on though pop it down and push it in remember the sugar super hot hey go if you leave it too long to put the embellishments on what will happen is they won't stick at all because there'll be nothing for them to stick to this ones are getting a little bit hard now so you've got to be super quick these are so pretty okay so I've used as embellishments now the rest of them I'm gonna do well you can use any sprinkle you want really it doesn't matter my children really like it when I put millions on them no those millions you can get or nerds they're great as well I'm putting because it's Christmas I'm doing Christmas balls on this one and I think I'll do some stars on this on the others it's basically showing you can use anything really anything you want to use so put a red one and a white one and green one on there green one go white one and a red one on there now what you have to do is give them about ten minutes to set and as soon as they set you can take them out of the molds we've left these to cool for 10 minutes now it's time to take them out and finish cooling on a piece of baking parchment pretty down as you can see the little bits that are touching them it's just falling off the side and you can always just try bit and see if you like them these are without a doubt favorite any kind of kids party or children's gathering even add r72 now we can leave them on the baking parchment until they're cold to the touch and then they're going to go straight into their own individual cellophane bags so when they're being stored they don't stick to each other and also once you add a nice little ribbon on them or they're perfect to give as a gift so there we have it now you know how to make your own tasty gorgeous Christmas lollipops perfect for children at this time of year thank you so much for watching my video if you enjoyed it then please click subscribe because I'm going to be adding so many more see you soon you", "ID_y1ArCBmU": "I'll start things off with grape lollipops it's a perfect introduction to candy making so the first thing I need to do is prepare my lollipop mold you don't need to buy a fancy mold to make lollipops you can actually create your own what I have is a baking tray lined with parchment paper and I'm going to sift 2 to 3 cups of icing sugar on to the tray have a nice thick layer of icing sugar the amount you need really just depends on the size of your tray basically you want about half an inch layer of icing sugar just grab a spatula when you're spreading out your icing sugar do it loosely don't pack it down and the bigger the tray you use well the more lollipops you can fit on now that I have an even and pretty level layer I can create my lollipop shapes what you want to do is take a flat bottom glass in any shape you want and press it into the icing sugar packing it right down and take a little peak to make sure that you have clearance of about a quarter inch maybe just a little less all the way around this is where you're going to pour in your hot sugar to shape your lollipop you can find lollipop sticks at some grocery stores but definitely at stores that sell baking supplies and I press it into the icing sugar so that one end of the stick goes right into the mold there we go now I'm all set what I love about making lollipops at home is the fact that you can control the flavor and the color and you can go all natural using clear fruit juices is a great way to add flavor and color so I'm making grape lollipops by using grape juice I'm measuring out half a cup of grape juice now on its own this grape juice is too thin it won't add in a flavor or color so what I need to do is reduce it I'll put it in a small sauce pot turn up the heat on high and I want to reduce this down to about 2 tablespoons by volume this will only take a few minutes and you could use any juice you want so long as it's a clear juice that way your lollipops are nice and clear there we go my juice is reduced to now a syrup two tablespoons worth because the water has evaporated away so you're left with that concentrated flavor color and sweetness so now we're all set to start the actual lollipops first I put a quarter cup of water in the bottom of my pot that way it makes it easier for the one cup of sugar I add to immediately start dissolving you want to liquefy that sugar pretty quickly and then typical to a lot of candy making corn syrup white corn syrup is a common ingredient that really gets the clarity and the set to your candy making so I'm adding a quarter cup I'll set my heat to high which is how you cook all of your sugar when your candy making and that sugar boils and it boils beyond 212 Fahrenheit you want to cook it all the way to 300 degrees Fahrenheit that's called hard crack in the candy making world and it's before it turns to caramel but yet it sets up so that your lollipops have a nice crunch using a thermometer is important in candy making that's how you know you've hit your temperatures precisely but as the sugar starts melting and coming to a boil and throughout the process I occasionally take a brush dipped in cool water and just brush the sides of the pot this ensures that any sugar that might boil up and hit the side of the pot doesn't then cool down and crystallize give this a little check I'm at 235 the goal is 300 I can tell I'm getting close because the bubbling of the sugar is starting to slow because the sugar itself is thickening up there we go once your sugar hits the 300 degrees take it off the heat and then you want to add that concentrated grape syrup and give it a quick stir in immediately it adds that gorgeous purple color and I can smell the grape now you take your ladle and pour in to each mold make sure you're covering that lollipop stick if you find your sugar is starting to set up on you you can always put it back on the stove on low heat to remelt the sugar and this is where you can get creative with your decorations you could add sprinkles a few draws a is like I'm adding finished with a few more small ways once you're finished with your lollipops you want to give them 15 to 20 minutes to set up then it's time to take them out of the icing sugar they will have icing sugar on them from the mold so first I take a little brush to brush them off and take a lightly moistened cloth or paper towel and just wipe off the icing sugar and then I dry it off and there you can actually see right through it once they're cleaned up and have had a chance to air dry a little bit then you can pack them up in little sello bags for gifting or just store them in an airtight container until you need them I bet you never guessed that making lollipops was actually so easy an all-natural to love that nice grape flavor it just looks so sweet", "kfcM43PZD_k": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

"welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music]

review some Mexican candy and we have guests reviewers Batman and the Joker hi guys hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm we're glad you guys can join us let's take a look at the package of candy I don't speak Spanish so you'll have to be patient with me omit the brand that this looks like it's Benny and it says beni Sandhya's and these are watermelon flavored lollipops on the back side here's the nutrition information and it's in Spanish also and it looks like this candy was made in mexico is right here and right here it says watermelon flavor heart candy lollipops with chili center I've never had anything quite like this so this will be fun to try I'm going to open the package in the package we get seven of these lollipops and it looks like they have some kind of chili flakes or spices on the stick here but there's a cute little walking watermelon with a big smile and this is what the sucker looks like I'm going to open it up it's what looks like I'm going to try this yeah the flavors really odd so I've just eaten the outside powdery coating and it's kind of bitter a little bit spicy but mostly bitter I can't imagine craving this so hopefully butting into this tastes a little bit better than the powder on the outside I bit into this and this is what the watermelon candy soccer / it looks like and the watermelon flavor is really delicious it's a yummy classic watermelon flavor just like any kind of American hard candy like a American hard candy jolly rancher it has that kind of watermelon flavor and it's that part's delicious eating this can be a little further you can tell this part is red and this part is green the green part tastes like watermelon and this red part tastes like chili like real Chili Peppers but it's sweet the chili pepper part is delicious and the watermelon part is very yummy this powder part on the on the outside I do not like if I rinse this off and just ate the hard candy sucker it tastes really good but the the powder part I do not like and I don't get it my review on these suckers are that they're very unusual I think they're they're fun the combination of watermelon and the chili pepper I love it's not a taste I normally eat together they taste really good together but this powder part I do not like so my review on these is I'm kind of neutral because the hard candy party is delicious and unusual but the powder is not good so I think they're fun to try and fun to have around but i think i would rinse off the powder part because i can't imagine eating all of it well Batman what do you think about this candy oh I love Mexican candy the powder doesn't bug me I I like the flavor Joker what do you think about the candy I think it's delicious and the powder part doesn't bug me either I like a little bitterness on my candy well it sounds like Batman and the Joker like these suckers a little more than I do if you liked this video please click Subscribe and we'll make more epic junk food and candy fun we love taste-testing candy and junk food and playing with toys hope to see you again soon friends", "-F7KCiRtmwA": "In today's video, we're going to see what happens\nif we take 1000 lollipops, and melt them in a slow cooker. [Music] I'm Nate. I'm Calli, and we have\na new slow cooker. What should we put in it? I have a couple extra lollipops. Yeah. [Music] You might not know\nwhat the word couple means. Well, I wanted a lollipop, and I figured\nif I'm buying a lollipop, I might as well buy\na couple extra. So we need a thousand\nfor the project today. Is there a thousand there? I think so. Well. better get started. We have made some hard\ncandy stuff before, and it usually seems\nto melt pretty well. So we're thinking that these lollipops\nwill melt back down, and I'm curious what's going\nto happen with the colors. We've got like two or three\ndifferent types of lollipop, and they're all multiple colors. So I'm wondering if we're gonna get\nlike swirled effect, or if it's just going to turn\nlike into a brown blob. It's going to go brown. Might depend on if we mix it. What's going to happen\nto the sticks, because we're not going\nto take the sticks out. We're just going to throw\nthat in with it, and hopefully, the sticks won't melt,\neven though they are plastic. If they do, then we're not gonna want to eat\nwhat comes out of this. So these are just Tiger Pops. Lots of pretty colors, but we're really not sure\nabout the flavor. All right, so we each need\nto count off 500. [Music] So, are you sure\nwe have a thousand? We might have a few extra. [Music] Aha! Number 1,000. We still have space,\nand we still have lollipops. So I think we should just keep\ngoing a little bit. [Music] That was an extra\ntwenty one on my part. 1,171 lollipops in a Crock-Pot. And now we turn it on,\nand see what happens. Yep. Oh, no, there's more. 71, 72, 75, 76. 1,176. We had a set to about\n250 degrees Fahrenheit, and we started getting a lot\nof smoke coming off of it. Our goal is not to just\nset it on fire, and have tons of sugar burning. So we've lowered\nthe temperature down to 150. We thought it was the candy\nburning just at first, but the sticks are melting too,\nso got to be careful of that. This may not be edible\nby the time it's all melted. Wanna make a lollipop sculpture\nhere and just [inaudible]? That's just a stick. Now, you have garbage\nin my beautiful sculpture. Hey, Mark, we made this for you. I want to try and stir it. Like I feel like that's\nonly safe way to do this. I think it's only melt\naround the edges. So we just need\nto let it sit longer, at the lower temperature. [Music] Okay, so we are having success in melting\nthe lollipops themselves. The problem that we're having\nis to get them to melt, we're having to raise it\nto such a high temperature that the sticks\nare also melting. So the plan is now, we are actually going\nto lower the heat, but also... Put a lid on. Hopefully, we can contain\nsome of that heat, and actually get an even melt. Fingers crossed. I've got this silicone cake pan, and if everything goes pretty\nwell with our melting lollipops, I want to try maybe pouring some\nof the lollipop goo into here, and making a giant\nlollipop out of it. Kind of depends on if we can get some\nof the sticks out of the way, and if everything doesn't like\nburn badly in that roaster, and something like that,\nbut we're going to give a shot. So here's a lollipop mold,\nhere's a lollipop stick. [Music] Make it a little bit smaller than the diameter\nof the stick so that... [inaudible] the lollipop\nwill leak through. [Music] I think that looks\nlike it should work pretty well. [Music] So at this point, we're going to try and\nget the sticks out. Now, most of this looks burned, but we think\nit's mixed flavour? Just maybe everything got mixed? Mine taste good. [Music] That's definitely\nsomewhat burned. [Music] Okay quick update. We were trying to melt\nhere a thousand lollipops, and I think we were\njust a little impatient. We're just trying to kind of do\nit in sort of a one-day thing, and it really burned. And we left the plastic in. We're going to try, and revisit this with\na slightly different method, because this, it's just burnt. Like it doesn't even\ntaste good anymore, and that kind\nof defeats the purpose. >> So we're going to try it again.\n>> It taste okay. We're gonna try it was\nlower heat and longer time. I think we're going to try\nletting it run like overnight, or even for a day or two just to see\nif we can get it to work. Guys, the first time we tried putting our lollipops\nin a slow cooker, what we had was actually more\nof a roasting pan. It is something\nthat can cook slowly, but it doesn't work the same way\nas a regular slow cooker. So we've adapted and changed\nthings up a little bit. So our crock pot is\na little bit different. A crock-Pot has\nthick ceramic walls, cooks things slower, but at a much more\neven ambient temperature. Hopefully, fingers crossed,\nit's not going to burn things. You can see\nthis right here, like this whole thing is... I think it can't\neven lift it out. That is full of hundreds\nof lollipops right now. So that's thick ceramic, and at no point is there\nlike a thin steel wall that gets too hot, and should start\nburning the lollipops. That was the biggest problem\nwe ran into before, is well, the inside temperature overall\nmight be controlled pretty well, the edges get too hot, and so we really started\nhaving burned sugar. So we got new lollipops. We have now unwrapped\na new thousand lollipops, and these ones actually\nhave paper sticks. So even if they are in contact\nwith a heating element, they probably, I don't think it\nwould get hot enough to burn, and definitely,\nwouldn't get it to melt. So we've got\nour new slow cooker, which is now very very full of unwrapped lollipops\nwith paper sticks. And unfortunately, we can't fit\nall 1000 in at first. So we have a plan. Plan's going to\nbe pretty simple. We are going to wait\nuntil this melts down, and as it does, we're going to add\nthe rest of them. So this is what? 800 almost or-- Yeah, I'd say we probably added\nabout 800, and 200 here. So once those 800 melt down,\nwe're going to pour in the rest, and hopefully,\neverything melts evenly, and then we can pour\nit into our mold. If the glass top gets\nto covered in steam, we'll probably take that off. It would go slower\nwithout the top, so we're hoping\nthat doesn't happen, but we'll keep an eye on it. And if it gets opaque, so we can't see\nthe lollipops melting, we'll remove it. [Music] Our lollipops are\nthoroughly cooked. More thoroughly than we were expecting them\nto become in fact. Or that we wanted\nthem to become. I was confident that the low setting\non a slow cooker like this, with the ceramic pot\nto evenly distribute the heat, would keep it all low enough that we wouldn't have\na burning problem. I was wrong. So that was just a piece that had bubbled over\nand drip down the side. and I was just tasting it,\nsee what it's like, and it's very burned tasting. There is like a fruity\ntangy flavor to it. But then it's also\njust pretty acrid. Taste like burnt sugar, huh? Yeah, that's burnt sugar\nwith a little bit of flavoring. Let's see if we\ncan get this lid off. It bubbled over\nlike around the lid, then it cooled down. So now the lid is\npretty well attached, and it's glass. Wait, see if we can just\npick the whole thing up by the lid handle. Okay, you go for that. >> Oh, well, we got the lid off.\n>> Well, it worked. Okay. Now, we have what looks like a pot\nfull of pretzel sticks. That one actually broke\nlike a pretzel stick. Usually, lollipop sticks\nlike his will just bend. This is just... That's like your pretzel. [Music] You can break them,\nbut you can't really chew them. Mmm. It's a weird combination\nof sour and bitter. Actually, it still\nsmells quite good. >> It smells like lollipops.\n>> It really does. These were our remaining few that we did manage to get\ninto the crock pot before it boiled over. This has more smell than this. Really? Wait. Yeah. That doesn't really\nsmell like much to me. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think burning it, or even this cooking it kind\nof brought that smell out. It smells very fruity. Like a candy fruit flavor,\nbut like a fruit flavor still. Check this out. The sugar is about here. So that means\nwe have four inches of solid burned cooked sugar\nfull of lollipop sticks. Look, it's a new\nsort of lollipop. Oh, yes. It's the sideways lollipop\nthat gouges in to your face. Those will be very popular. [Music] I regret everything. It's interesting. You really can still taste\nlike the fruit flavors of the lollipop mixed in\nwith the burning flavor. I was expecting a lot more\nof like a smoky burnt flavor. Yeah. Yeah. This is just bitter. Well, I'm surprised\nthat it did this. I have learned something\nabout crock pots. From what I researched, it said that the low setting\nshould be under 200 degrees. But I assume that even though we had\nthe thick ceramic pot, it still had hot spots\nwhere right at the edges, it was getting higher\nthan that temperature, and the temperature that I looked up must have been\nthe average inside temperature. The ambient temperature. Yeah, so we were getting burning as you probably saw\nin the time-lapse. It kind of foamed up, bubbling and burning\non one side. A little bit on both sides,\nmore on one side than the other, and just took over everything. Yeah, and it was\naround the edges. So I'm-- Yeah, like you said, I assumed that heat was much\nmuch higher than expected. This doesn't taste\nnearly as burnt. Yep. It's more efficient this way.

Talk to you then.", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before stay tuned for this great recipe thanks for watching", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you

What a great pun.", "vxDsf_KMnxg": "Welcome to How To Cook That, I'm Ann Reardon\nand today we are making our own candy lollipops, spirals, candy with a pattern on the inside\nand sherbet filled candies. What you'll need to make these is some sugar,\nglucose syrup, water and some cream of tartar. Put the sugar and the water into the pan with\nthe glucose syrup. Place that over high heat. If you've got any sugar crystals on the sides\nof your pan then you just want to wash those down using a wet pastry brush. Turn your oven on to 100C or 210F and place\na tray lined with non-stick baking paper in to warm up. Let your sugar mixture boil until it reaches\n150C or 302F. Turn off the heat and stir through the cream\nof tartar. Now we will follow this same basic process\nfor all of our candies. For the sherbet filled candy add yellow food\ncolouring and stir it through. And then pour that into a warm tray that has\nbeen lined with baking paper. Now to protect our hands from the heat we\nare going to use .. silicone gloves but these are not going to be enough so we are also\ngoing to use cotton gloves underneath them. Oh, and let me show you my nails while we\nare here - these are one of the designs in my own line of wraps that I'm doing with Jamberry. These ones are called YUM and they have cute\nlittle icecreams on them and I'll link to them below. For those of you who asked last week what\nare wraps? They are bit like stickers made out of nail\npolish, and you use a little bit of heat to stick them onto your nails. And they last up to few weeks. We are going to put these ones through some\nrough treatment today with heat and gloves and in and out of gloves. Fold in the edges towards of the hot sugar\ntowards the centre and then lift it up and begin to pull it out and then fold it back\nin. The more you pull it, the more shiny and opaque\nit becomes. If you want it to be transparent then don't\npull it much at all. Place it back in the tray and flatten it out\nas much as you can and then put it in the oven to warm up again. Now that it's warm you can stretch it into\na rectangle. Now usually when chefs make this sort of candy\nthey have a heat lamp shining on the candy that keeps it warm while it's on the counter\nso you don't need to keep putting it back in the oven, but they are super expensive\nso this is the way to do it home. Place a generous amount of sherbet down the\ncentre of your rectangle and then bring the sides up and around to cover it. Push down each of the ends to seal in the\nsherbet. Squeeze it to make a cylinder shape and then\nplace it back in the oven for about 30 seconds to a minute, just keeping an eye on it because\nyou don't want to overheat it. Once you can just stretch it when it's soft\nenough to stretch, pull the candy to make a long snake. Working quickly before it hardens make firm\nindents along the candy so that you are sealing in the sherbet into each one. To make lollipops we'll need a few different\ncolours in the one batch. So place strips of foil along the tray and\nthen cover it in baking paper. Prepare the candy just like we did before\nbut this time add a few drops of essence, I am using a fairy floss flavour. You can buy all different ones and then just\nflavour your candy. Pour some hot mixture into each of the sections. And then to get you pan clean all you need\nto do is fill it up with water and leave it to soak and the sugar will just dissolve off. Add food colouring to each section in the\ncolours that you are after for your lollipop. And then using scissors, cut along the baking\npaper so you can work with one colour at a time. Fold it into the middle and then stretch it\nuntil it becomes opaque. Make it into a snake and then set it aside. Repeat that with the blue. And the red\nAnd the yellow and the clear one as well to make it white Then warm them slightly again in the oven\nand place them together to make a cylinder and squeeze them so that they stick together. Cut the cylinder in half and leave some to\nkeep warm while you stretch the other half. Twisting as you stretch so you get that pretty\npattern. Take a lollipop stick and poke it into one\nend then wrap the mixture around and around pressing it into place. And you can keep going to make your lollipop\nas giant as you want it to be. To make the spirals remove the mixture from\nthe heat and add in flavouring, for this one I am using musk. Split it into two sections and add red colouring\nto one half and blue into the other. We are going to take the blue half and pull\nit and stretch it to make it opaque but with the red half we are just going to leave that\nand not pull it all. Keep pulling the blue half and twisting it\nso that you can see there the more we pull it and the more we twist it the more opaque\nand shiny it becomes. Don't pull the red half just cut it in half\nto make two long cylinders. Pull the blue into two long snakes too and\nthen stack them up to make a square. It looks a bit like toothpaste. Squeeze them together to round it out and\nthen cut that into two. Working with one half pull it and make it\nthinner into a nice thin long stick. And you can slice it while ti is warm to make\nindividual candies OR to make the spirals, wrap it around a thick skewer. Once it is all the way to the end you can\njust pull the skewer out and leave those to cool. See how the pink there is totally transparent\nbecause we didn't pull it and the blue is opaque. The other thing you can do is roll some of\nthis mixture into a ball and make round lollipops and just put a stick in one end. And you can make as many different candies\nas you like just by flavouring and colouring each one differently. And now for something which is going to be\nhard to do without a heat lamp but I reckon we can do it. We're going to split the mixture into three\nand colour some red, leave some plain and colour the last section green. Pull each of the colours just like we have\ndone before to make them opaque. And then stretch the red one to make three\nlong snakes, return one to the oven to warm up. And once it is soft and pliable, place it\nacross the top of the two red snakes and shape it at the top into a point. Add some white along each side of that triangle\nand then flip it up the other way and add a strip down the centre on the top. And then finally add more white so that the\nred is completely covered. Warm your green, and stretch it out and add\nit over the top of the white so that it goes all the way around. Now you are going to need to place that back\nin the oven to warm it up because those two red ones are quite cold by now. And once it's warm you can just stretch that\ncandy out into a long strip. Now to cut it without it shattering it needs\nto be quite warm so return it to the oven until you can bend it like this. And then quickly using a sharp knife, chop\noff pieces to reveal the little heart inside.

the ordinary home into an extraordinary home yes and today we have got a fun project for you we do we are going to be making some yarn lollipops these are so cute they would be really cute on a christmas tree in wreaths and just in any kind of candy themed decor for christmas yes you could even just put them in a vase put several of them in a little vase and have them on a side table or something they'd be so cute yes i think these are so adorable so let's go ahead and tell you what we're working with today to make these lollipops you will need two different um colors of really chunky yarn so this is uh some yarn that i got from hobby lobby and we've got a few different colors that we're going to be using today you also need these discs they're foam circle discs from the dollar tree yep and they come two in a pack yeah and you're going to need a pair of scissors then you're going to need something to use for the stick now what we have chosen to use for our lollipop stick are just straws decorative straws that you can get from walmart they may even have them at the dollar tree i'm not sure about that but these actually came from michael's that we're using today yes and they make it so festive and cute yeah you'll also need your glue gun yep got to have that and we're going to be making a couple of little bows to go on them so we've got some um just any kind of thin wired ribbon yes all right so let's go ahead and get started yes let's do the first thing we want to do is find the center of our disk so you can actually use a tape measure and find the exact center but i'm just going to eyeball it and just make a little mark with my scissors just a small little place so that i know that that's the center now you also want to go ahead and make your hole that your uh straw is going to go into so just use your scissors and just push it in and make you a hole just like that now we've got it ready so we're going to now use our glue gun and right where you marked in the center just put a dot of your glue and we're just gonna put these two down we've got them together we're just gonna put those down right on that dot of glue now just be careful you will burn yourself so be very careful well hopefully you don't yes hopefully not but if you need to just mash it down using your scissors just like that yeah but you can any time you're working with yeah you can certainly definitely okay now you want to go ahead with your glue and make a ring right around where your yarn is going to go so let's go right around there and we're just going to twist just like this we're going to just twist it right around you do want it to be right up next to the one so you've got to do it a little tightly but not too tight and if you see that you don't have enough glue just go through like this and glue some more just like that we're just going to continue as we go around continue using our glue and we're just gonna continue to wrap it right around and the really great thing about these they don't have to be perfect no they don't you can do them any kind of color combination you could even use three colors if you wanted to but i like the two like this i'm just going to keep coming around and i just go back and make sure if i lift up on it and it's not glued then i just put a little glue right there because you do want it to hold so just go back and make sure that you've got it glued just like that and we're just going to continue on around and i kind of use my hand just to pat it down yes it'll take you know a little bit for that glue to dry but exactly kind of helps yes it does these are already turning out so aren't they cute and yes your yarn will get twisted a little bit but you just untwist it just like that and we're just going to continue using our glue to stick it and make sure that it's glued really well all around and you can kind of tell as you're doing it if there's a piece that's not glued it will kind of be up a little further so uh just go ahead and put a little glue right there now we're going on around i've got to get another glue stick okay i'm actually doing a candy thing for christmas oh yes i always do one in my dining area and kitchen so i'm excited to use these yes this year and you know you can spend a lot of money going just by trying and it does you know i get that you know it makes things quicker to buy things but it's not nearly as fun as making them yourself right not and this is a great project that you could do with the kids uh you could use actually elmer's glue to do this it's going to take drying time so it's going to be a you know longer process now when you get to the side you just want to continue on around you see how the side is and i'm still going to continue on around and make sure that i've got them together going up my side just like that because you do want to make sure it's all covered so we're just going to continue on around i'm running out of glue yeah a little bit there we go make sure i get my pink one glued really good on the side just like that whoops got in the glue okay and you're just going to keep going around make sure to get around the top because you don't want to leave a place around the top at all so you want to keep bringing them around just like that until see how the whole complete top is done now and we've got part of the side so now i'm just going to continue on the side adding my glue and actually one or two if you get two um things of the yarn it will make several of these yes it will if you get two rolls it'll make i don't know how many but a good bit yes it will and you could even you know if you've got get four rolls then you could make several different combinations and that would be so cute okay now i'm still just going on around and you see it's automatically coming towards the back as you come around so i'm just using my glue i'm going ahead and putting the glue on there make sure it's up around the the one in front of it just like that because you don't want a single space oops i gotta get some more glue too now the good thing about when you do use the white yarn like i'm using if you do have a little bit of a space it's not it's not going to show as much that's true and don't worry you see i did get some glue on my yarn don't worry about that you can cut that off and it's not even going to be noticeable you just want to make sure it's really good and tight all the way around okay now before i go any further i'm just going to go around and make sure i see a little spot right here that didn't get enough glue so i'm going to put a little glue there so that i don't have any places that it's not glued well okay now we're all the way around to the complete back and you she's way ahead of me look at there you are ahead i mean these really are very simple they are simple it's literally just wrapping it around and it is extremely easy but like i was saying about the kids just make sure that if you do uh do these with your kids or your grandkids that you use a different kind of glue because the hot glue is gonna you're going to get it on you yeah i would definitely either use a low temp what we're using is a high temp with this you can use either one yes so whatever you have on hand is fine but definitely if you're doing it with kids um yes i mean i'd stick with elmer's glue i think i would just maybe a project that i do with my kids yes you can certainly do that they would love it oh they would they would get a kick out of this they definitely would because i had shown them these yesterday when i finished one and both of them loved it yeah well they love lollipops yes and really i'm not even going for perfection here because they look so cute and they don't even have to be perfect no they don't they absolutely don't i'm just going to continue to go around until you get it completely covered so i'm gonna go ahead and put enough blue on the last part to get it finished okay once you get to the end i'm a little bit ahead of her you just want to cut that right off yep but you see how simple and adorable this is now that i've gotten to the center goodness how cute now these i'm just going to put another little dab of glue in there and i'm just going to put these right in the inside just like that okay now how adorable i've got it all over my fingers too cute yes aren't they adorable they don't even have the sticks out what guys would be so cute you could actually make these into ornaments oh yes and hat just clip some of the little you know um yes fishing line a little fishing line certainly make them ornaments for your tree wouldn't that be wouldn't that be so cute yes so they're cute like that but we're going to now make them into lollipops yep so i'm just going right now and just mashing again just to make sure that i've got it good all the way around mine is pretty secure yes and now i've got to find the hole that i made i found my hole yeah i'm not going to use that color yeah there's mine so let me go over here and get a stick and let's see now i lost it where was it i've got to find it again there it is yeah they're you just want to make sure you put that little hole first just because that styrofoam is pretty it is tough to get this through and that just kind of helps it and it's going to keep it really secure in there yes it will and i am having a time trying to find where it is you found it and then and then i lost it i should not have moved should i make another one yes i certainly can it doesn't matter that's exactly what i'm going to do i bet it's right down there i think so but somewhere yeah i thought it was but i can't find it but if you forget to make the hole or anything like that you can simply do it after you have made it just use your scissors again just like that and then put some glue around the end of it and that just kind of extra and just stick it straight in just like that is that not adorable yeah and like i was saying that just kind of makes it extra secure because really i mean you could do it without even gluing it in there mine was in there pretty good yeah so really just kind of makes it extra secure it does now i said i was going to show you uh there were several places that i got a little bit of glue on my yarn just take like this and just kind of clip it off any of the glue try don't pull on it because if you pull it's going to unravel the the yarn so you don't want to pull on it but just kind of clip it off and i see i didn't get my end down in there good so let me go back and get my end in there these are so cute they really are and you see how easy they are it takes just a few minutes to do that but oh so easy and so adorable and if you wanted to there's a couple things you could do to kind of dress them up even more you could sprinkle some glitter on there if you wanted to you could spray some glitter um this diamond dust glitter blast i think would be so cute sprayed on it yes i'm not going to spray it right now just because we're not in a well insulated area when you do it that you are in a well-ventilated area you can just spray that just do it outside spread do a couple sprays on there it's just going to give it that nice little glitter yes because we love glitter and bling yes got to have that got to have it so but see and now we want to put a little bow on these and you could use you know any color that you wanted to anything like that uh or you could not have a bow right so we'll leave one without and we'll add you know you can just do the different ways you can do it yes you could just tie it right around that way do you see the wire the floral wire over there what i'm going to do is i'm just going to uh get a piece of floral wire now um you could use pipe cleaners or anything like that uh but i'm just going to make a quick little bow by making a loop you don't want a big one so we're just going to do a little loop like that i'm just going to make my loop i'll leave the place right there and then i'm just going to twist my ribbon around and make another loop just make sure they're about even just like that and then i'm just going to cut these off and i'm just gonna take my wire you could use anything that you've got a pipe cleaner uh anything like that would work but i'm just twisting it around the center and i've got a cute little bow and then i'm what i'm you could actually wire it here just like this to the back but what i'm going to do i've twisted it several times so it's not going to come loose so i'm just going to cut the wire off just like that and i want to dovetail these ends to make them pretty so to do that i just fold them over in the center and take my scissors at the corner and cut upward and i'm going to do the same thing here fold it in half and here where the corner is i'm going to take my scissors and go upward just like that and that makes those cute little dovetails and then i'm just going to put a little dot of glue right there and dot it like that and now we've got our cute little bow see how sweet those are so you can as you can see different ribbon you can use or you don't have to use yes you wouldn't even have to use anything if you didn't want to because they are just as cute without but you could do any kind of ribbon uh something if you wanted to match your tree or anything like that so how cute are these so cute i'm in love with these i can't wait to make some more of these and use them this christmas yes they are so precious

lollipops their beauty is like pieces of art or jewelry because we're putting fresh spring flowers inside of them keep watching to learn how to make this sweet treat on just add sugar we're bringing you some of our favorite sugary treats that are short attempt and delight any sweet tooth this recipe is really simple to make we're gonna start by making a hard candy and it's really important that you have a candy thermometer so into a sauce pot I've set it at a medium-high key I'm gonna start by adding our granulated sugar corn syrup and water we're just gonna keep this until it starts to bubble while your sugar is heating up you might be tempted to stir it but don't as soon as it gets to to 75 to 80 right before it gets a to 85 we're gonna take it off the heat and we're gonna add our flavoring and our coloring and be sure to get oil candy color just going to put a couple drops of the consistency should be like thick thick thick syrup and then we're gonna pour these into candy molds you can find these online or in a bacon supply shop perfect little shape for the lollipop before you fill your mold you want to lightly spray with nonstick cooking spray this just makes it easier to take the lollipop out and using a spoon I'm just gonna carefully put a little bit of this syrup mixture directly into the mold stopping halfway and then adding our flour right on top I have tiny little orchids daisies there's a whole list of flowers that you can use you want to make sure that they're organic and edible and then cover it with a little bit more and add your lollipop stick and then twist it ever so slightly so that the entire thing is coated in this process you really need to work efficiently and carefully because this mixture is super hot you also want to take advantage of it at this stage once they've hardened this could take five to ten minutes you should easily be able to pop them out of their molds look how beautiful these are these make great wedding favors DIY edible gifts and you can have fun with the added you can not only use spring flowers but maybe sprinkles or luster dust these dainty lollipops are so beautiful it'll be really hard to eat them thanks so much for watching I'm brandy we'll see you next time on just add sugar", "lIOaYPbhjcc": "Valentine's comes so soon it seems like after Christmas I mean literally about the day after the Christmas decorations are taking down the store I think the Valentine's display are put up I know it all seems too soon to sudden everything comes too fast but I do love a reason to celebrate and you know what if it can be a little bit more of a homemade celebration I think all the better that's why I'm gonna help you make amazing homemade Valentines suckers this year what you're gonna make the suckers I know it's so easy to go to the store and just buy a bag of mom and give them out to people give them to your kids to take to their class but come on making my home is actually so fun and I think you're going to be surprised how easy this is because it really is easy but as a word of caution before we start working with sugar is dangerous you can actually burn yourself and I'm just gonna tell you now I've done it I am telling you from experience just the other week before Christmas I burned myself pretty bad on a batch of peanut brittle so you want to make sure to have a bowl of ice water by the stove ready to go plunge your hand into it if you get sugar on it so be careful and do not let the kids help do this because it can be a little scary but put that aside don't worry if you do it right you will not have a problem to start you just want to make sure to have everything ready to go you can buy these sucker molds at any craft supply store kitchen store they are extremely inexpensive and you can buy any shape you want since it's Valentine's I'm meeting some hearts but I also have just some regular round circles too just to add a little bit of difference and show you what you can do I like to put my molds on parchment lined baking sheet that way if you drizzle any of the sugar onto the counter or onto the sheet it just goes round to that parchment paper and it is really easy cleanup so before we start you just want to make sure to rub the insides of all these molds with vegetable oil once again from experience I've learned if you don't they don't really come out that nice and they don't look that nice so just lightly put a little bit of a paper towel and vegetable oil and rub the insides of the mold then you just want to put some sucker sticks which come from the craft supply store - they're usually right beside these molds so don't worry place them in with the mold and have it go about half way up into the sucker kind of just however much you want it to go up and then you are ready to go once your molds are ready to go you can just set them aside and leave them until you're ready next it's important to make sure everything is also ready to go so just have whatever flavoring you're going to use and we'll talk about that here in a little bit and your food coloring just set aside and ready for when it's needed because as you know in the past when you work with sugar once the sugars ready you need to be ready there is no time to just wait around part of making sure everything is ready I also like to have a glass heat proof measuring cup at least a two cup size ready to go to pour the sucker mixture in before you pour them into the molds if you try to write out a saucepan you were gonna have the stuff all over and you don't want that so just lightly oil the inside of this measuring cup so it comes out easier and cleanup is easier and then set that aside okay to start in a small saucepan you just want to put in some sugar yes these are suckers so of course they have sugar then you just want to put a little bit of water and some corn syrup now the corn syrup I like to take the measuring cup and just lightly rub it with oil too that way it will just come out a little bit easier you don't have to that is just a nice little tip that I love to do once all your ingredients are in that saucepan you just want to set it on the stove over medium to medium-high heat stir it just a little bit to make sure now the sugars sticking to the bottom and then once it is starting to get warm you can just turn it up to high yes remember I said this gets really hot so it turns up to high have that ice water beside you and be watching it it's going to come to a full boil and remember that a boil is about 212 degrees so once it starts boiling you know that it's about 212 degrees but we are taking this all the way up to hard crack which is about 300 degrees and that's quite a ways to go so once it starts boiling you just want to start watching it closely and then after a little while you want to start taking the temperature to see where it's at usually I find that once it starts boiling it stays around 225 to 230 for quite a while that temperature is usually where the water starting to boil off and evaporate and once that's done it really starts to climb so watch it carefully make sure to have your candy thermometer fitted on your saucepan if you're using a traditional candy thermometer I use an instant-read thermometer which I love but you may not all have one so use whatever you're used to once your temperature reaches 300 degrees turn off the stove and take the pan off right away this is where I said it's great to have everything ready to go you want to pour in your flavoring now you can use whatever flavoring you like I do a mix the traditional old recipe that my grandma used to make mushy made candy was just cinnamon candy which I know in today's modern times a lot of people don't love cinnamon candy I still kind of like it i no big surprise but you can also go the more modern route and do cherry I love to use whatever flavoring and usually these flavorings are right beside these candy molds in the aisle so you can just pick and choose right there and then put in your food coloring red obviously it's Valentine's Day and then stir that up it is going to bubble kind of vigorously at first so be careful and then pour it right into your prepared measuring cup you do want to work rather quickly because sugar does harden fairly fast so once it's near majoring cups start pouring it into your molds I like to pour it directly over that stick that's going to be in the middle of the sucker that way you make sure that's coated completely and if it starts to bubble quite a bit in your molds just move on to the next one and then you may have to go back and fill them back up if they weren't all the way full as you can tell as I keep going along it gets a lot thicker because it is cooling down so it is becoming harder don't worry you just have to work as quick as you can but don't rush yourself you could always make more you don't want to get in a hurry and either burn yourself or make a huge mess once you have all of it out of there and in your molds you just want to set the mold aside in a little bit cooler place until they harden completely that's all there is to it I told you this was easy once they are hard they just pop right out of the mold because we oiled them make sure you all them or they are not gonna pop right out they're gonna break out and then no one's happy with that once you take my out of the mold you can put them right into one of these nice little cellophane bags they're clear they look perfect on these suckers then they won't stick together either and then just twist them off with a little twist tie I mean these are so fun because you made them it is so much more meaningful and you can tailor them to whatever flavor you love so this Valentine's I hope you make your own sucker candy because they are absolutely delicious fun and easy if you agree in like this video make sure to click like below and then head on over and click

below in the description place a medium sized pot to the top of your stove and turn your temperature on to a medium heat now pour a half cup of red wine into your pot go ahead and set a timer for 10 minutes and cook that wine so it reduces down for about 10 minutes after 10 minutes add 3/4 cup of sugar and add a pinch of sea salt last ingredient needed just add 4 tablespoons of light corn syrup now go ahead and just give it a mix around until it's fully mixed together and there's no clumps of sugar now pull your spoon out because you do not want to mix it anymore after it's mixed and place a candy thermometer into your pot and still let that cook on a medium heat you do not want or not to need at all and let it cook to a temperature of 275 degrees keep an eye on it because it does cook really fast [Music] after it reaches the temperature of 275 degrees on to a silicone pad or parchment paper start pouring it into a slow steady stream so it resembles a circle and they look like a lollipop shape after you pour like about a few circles place your lollipop stick into the candy and start twisting it so that way both sides get coated so that lollipop stick gets stuck in there and it will stay awesome and if you also want pour a little bit of the candy right on top of the lollipop stick so that way definitely definitely coated [Music] now go ahead and place your cookie sheet tray into the fridge for about 10 minutes and then after 10 minutes they should be completely ready to pull right off you can plate it up however you want but they look beautiful and amazing and they taste just like wine a super awesome way to decorate is grab your lollipops and push them into a styrofoam cone just because it looks super cool and if you have a party to which into an adult one of course these are not for kids this will look really beautiful now if you make these lolly pops please tag us I love to see what you did and you have a beautiful day any questions write them below

"HUb6baa_ym4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel I hope you guys are having a good day you know what I mean like I'm so sorry for my wheel being in the way but um here's the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "uFAlwJBFmbw": "Da-na-new-new-new, new-new-new-new-new, New-new-new! Hey guys, it\u2019s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy\nNummies. In honor of the new Jurassic Park movie Jurassic\nWorld, that is coming out, I thought we should make a themed treat. Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite,\nclassic movies, I love Dinosaurs and I have seen this movie so many times,\nso I wanted to make something from the original. Today we are gonna be making Amber Fossil\nThemed Lollipops. Let\u2019s get started! The things you will need, will be: 1/3 cup\nof light corn syrup, 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 a cup of water, orange and yellow food\ncoloring, because an amber fossil walks the line on the color wheel between\nyellow and orange. Then 1/2 a teaspoon of flavoring, I\u2019m using orange flavoring,\nbut again, you can also use lemon or whatever flavor you\u2019d like. Some black licorice\ncandy, baking scissors, lollipop sticks, medium sized saucepan, a candy thermometer,\nsome baking spray, and some lollipop molds. Now let\u2019s put it all together. The first thing that we\u2019re gonna do is take\nyour black licorice and your baking scissors, and we\u2019re gonna cut them to look like little\nmosquitos to put inside our amber. So I\u2019m just gonna cut off the end, boop! And I\u2019m not making them look perfect, I\u2019m\njust gonna cut a bunch of little slices, doo-doo-doo-doo! To make little creepy bug legs. These little guys are so small, so just do\nthe best you can, doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, and we\u2019re gonna make one for every lollipop. Before we mix everything up on the stove,\nwe are gonna grease our lollipop pan, you can use Crisco or shortening, I\u2019m gonna\nbe using a little bit of baking spray, so that it doesn\u2019t stick! Now let\u2019s head over to the stove and make\nour candy. Place your medium sized saucepan on the stove.\nThen add your light corn syrup, water, and sugar. Turn the heat onto medium and whisk\ntogether until the sugar is dissolved. Once dissolved, raise the heat to medium high\nand let the candy mix sit until it reaches 300 degrees. Keep a close eye on it because\nthe heat rises quickly. Then remove from heat and add the flavoring,\n1 drop of orange food coloring, and 1 drop of yellow food coloring. Mix together until evenly combined and then\ntake everything back over to the baking station. Now we\u2019re gonna pour our candy mixture into\na measuring cup for a little bit more control. I\u2019m using a glass pyrex with a little spigot\nat the end. Now we\u2019re gonna fill our lollipops. Once you\u2019ve filled them, take your little\nblack licorice candy, and place him down. And then use a toothpick because the candy is still\nhot, and press him down, just gently. And then you\u2019re gonna take your lollipop\nstick, and place it in. And remember, you\u2019re only gonna put little\nbuggies into 1/2 of your molds, because the other molds will be the back. And now you\u2019re gonna\ndo this to the rest of your lollipops. Once your lollipop trays are filled, now we\nare gonna let them cool at room temperature, just let them sit here for about 40 minutes.\nAnd then, we\u2019re gonna pop \u2018em out. Once your lollipops have set, now we\u2019re\ngonna pop \u2018em out of the tray and stick them together. I didn\u2019t have one of those fancy 3-D Molds\nwhere the lollipop comes out all together, I just had this little neat tray, so, use\nwhat you got! Slides right out, right on! Oh and look at\nthat! And now we're gonna pop out the back. If you\u2019re just making these for yourself\nyou can just lick \u2018em and stick \u2018em together, but if you\u2019re going to share with friends,\nwhich is what I\u2019m going to do, you can take a little baking brush and a little\nbit of water, paint a little bit on the back. Boop-bewp-bewp-bewp! And stick \u2018em together. Now you\u2019re gonna hold them together for\n10 seconds, or you can hum the Jurassic Park theme song! Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, hmm-hmm-hmm! Alright, there we go, and I\u2019m just gonna\nstick him into this little foam block, and then you\u2019re gonna do that to the rest\nof your lollipops. Ta-da! Here are our Jurassic Park inspired\nAmber Fossil Lollipops that we made today. I hope you guys enjoyed them. I am so excited\nfor another dinosaur movie! Uh, if you guys can tell, I kind of love Dinosaurs! I\u2019ve got these 2. I actually moonlight as\na Jurassic Park scientist, a couple nights a week, and I used one of these mosquitos\nto make these guys. You guys didn\u2019t know that, now you do, boom! Also, a side note, is that some of the lollipops\nare completely sphered, we\u2019ve attached the backs, but if you didn\u2019t want\nto wait for those, to dry and you just wanted to eat \u2018em, you can also just leave\nthem as a little 1/2. I\u2019ll be posting lots of pictures of these\nyummy Jurassic Lollipops on Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and Twitter, and if you\nguys make these, or any other Jurassic treats, please take a picture and send them to me, I love seeing your baking creations, I just get a big kick out of it, it makes my day. And if you have any other ideas for any other\nNerdy Nummies, please let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do\nmy best to make it happen.

gonna do a little review about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "wKHaFj1T8Lg": "*Galactic Music* Corinne: Woah, dude! This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine.

Croix so today I'm sharing these easy boozy rum lollipops with you the first thing that goes in is a quarter cup of rum then 3/4 cup of sugar 3 tablespoons of corn syrup or Lyle's golden syrup and a pinch of salt swirl it around so everything gets absorbed cook on medium heat your sugar syrup will begin to pop clear bubbles then eventually turn a caramelized bronze amber color your candy is only ready when it registers at 300 degrees or when you dip it in cool water it hardens it should be set and never sticky lastly with the heat turned off swirl in a half a tablespoon of rum eaten either film molds are free pour them just like I showed you in my last heart candy video for flower candy lollipops these aren't overwhelmingly boozy but please keep in mind that all the alcohol content does not burn off and as always you can find the principle recipe link in the description box below each video and you can also catch up with me on Facebook and Instagram thanks so much for watching and if you liked please give it a like it really does help out my channel and subscribe if you aren't already as I put out new videos each week hope you guys have a great day and I'll see you next week", "yzJWSrvHsts": "today welcome to Todd's kitchen lollipops have been around for literally hundreds of years they're incredibly simple to make but they're actually pretty expensive to buy their shops so why not just make them home they're just as delicious and you can make any flavor color that you like so join me today as make my version of lollipops okay so to start this off I have a pot on the stove on a medium heat so it to the pot I'm going to add two cups of sugar then 2/3 of a cup of glucose or corn syrup know as a hint I've just warmed it up in the microwave it just makes a lot easier to work with and finally a quarter cup of water and I'm also using a candy thermometer now we want to go for the hard crack stage which is about 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius give or take but if you have one of these candy thermometers they're actually very cheap to buy you can get them online they're only about ten fifteen dollars but when it comes to candy it just makes life so much easier so over the medium heat we're just coming to give this stir just until the sugar is completely dissolved now you can also add some for example coloring if you like then you could also add some flavoring it's completely up to you I'm just keeping this as a basic recipe so I'll leave any coloring or flavoring that you choose to add up to you a lot of people like the plain should be a taste but if you want to add like say peppermint essence or raspberry or it's you know completely up to you and to the colors that you choose so it's gonna start to get to the stage where it's going to bubble now as you can see we've got some sugar crystals just on the inside so which is with a wet brush we're just going to brush them down which is basically dissolving the sugar back into the mix and this will just stop crystals from forming on top of our sugar mixture which basically ruins of the whole thing so just keep on doing this all the way around whenever you see these sugar crystals forming so puffs and keeping an eye on the sugar crystals forming on the outside just keep an eye on the temperature until we get to the hard crack stage which is again 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius now you may be tempted to turn the temperature up to make it rise up faster to get to the right temperature faster but slow and steady is the only way to do it because if you do it too fast you can actually going to burn that sugar and it honestly doesn't take that long at all whatsoever probably about five to ten minutes to get to the right temperature so take your time don't do it too fast and you'll get some lovely candy and also my best advice is apart from the occasional watered down of the sides what have you do don't stir it because I should make things worse you just want it to cook by itself let it do its thing just let it slowly come up to the right temperature so all you have to do is just occasionally Pat down the sides and that's it it's very very simple okay so it's just about to hit the hard crack stage now I've had the tilt the pan just slightly because the thermometer was in 100% under but it's just hitting the hard crack stage right now so take it straight off the heat okay now quickly I've got a bowl here with some ice an ice bath we're just going to place that in there and this will stop the sugar from cooking just don't let it touch the glass sides because if we leave it by itself it's going to continue cooking so we just want that to stop straight away [Music] otherwise it's going to get too much of a caramelized look and it's got a slight caramelized look but that's okay doesn't have to be perfect as long as it's each her when we've done some just poured it into a another pan this is a milk pan but I'm using this because it has this whip on it and this one doesn't so it's going to make a lot easier when we want to make our popsicles now this is a part where we have to work fast so I've got a baking tray here line with non-stick baking paper that I've also breezed with some more oil just to be on the safe side so we're just going to pour in small amounts like so okay that's enough and we're going to add a popsicle stick now these are a new one I found they're like a paper based one so no more plastic and while this too wet just decorate them any way you want that's going to be done now while the mixture is still fluid so just continue on making up all about popsicles so you can find those new paper base ones fantastic for the environment if I just use what you've got and this is what I want to go with a clear one because this way I can add some decorations to it so again you can still use color it's completely up to you and you can use a flavor that hopefully it's a flavor that doesn't have a color to it if it does well that's again that's okay this is so versatile you can do anything that should like with it [Music] okay so that was more than enough to make a few batches now it depends on the size of the lollipops you want to make so I made up another couple of sets of these so we're gonna let these sit here for at least two hours to completely set so they'll be nice and hard they're going to be wondering what am I gonna do with the pot cuz it's obviously gonna have some pretty hard sugar in it by now it's very very simple all you do is just fill it with water leave it for a few hours then simply pour it out because the sugars just going to dissolve into the water and it will disappear like magic so don't worry about any hard scrubbing or scraping just simply fill it with water set forget it come back a few hours later it's gone and now would you look at those delicious candy lollipops that turned out nice and clear and pretty with those extra sprinkles and let's be honest it's a hundred percent sugar so you know it's going to be a hundred percent good so they really have turned out very well they're incredibly delicious and also incredibly simple to make and again who doesn't love lollipops especially when they're nice and colorful and fun with sprinkles you could choose any sprinkles that you like see in Australia we call those hundreds and thousands or you can go for the stars and honestly I never know what these ones are called but they look great they're like little mini pearls and you don't even have to use sprinkles you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like they're incredibly versatile and no matter what flavor you choose they're going to taste simply delicious [Music]", "3FhyOBf0FvU": "how to make maple syrup and bacon lollipops hello everyone to start off you're gonna need some bacon cook the bacon until it's nice and crispy drain it and then Pat it dry with some paper towels for a batch of lollipops you probably only need one slice of bacon because we're only using a tiny piece the lollipops themselves are made with one ingredient maple syrup that's a cup and a half of maple syrup in a large saucepan bring the maple syrup to a boil over a medium heat give it a swirl a couple times at the beginning but once it starts to boil you don't have to stir it anymore continue to boil it over medium heat for about fifteen minutes or so until the temperature reaches 300 degrees of Fahrenheit now the best way to measure this is with a candy thermometer and you need to reach what's called the hard crack a candy stage this can be determined by using a glass of cold water I'll put a link in the description box if you want to use that method instead of a candy thermometer continue to cook it it will foam up quite a bit that's why we need the large saucepan keep an eye on it because towards the end when you get to about 275 degree range it will the temperature will shoot up quite suddenly to 300 so keep an eye on it and also if you start to smell burning sugar turn your heat down to medium-low because it does start to get a little bit Brown towards the end at 300 degrees Fahrenheit once it reaches the correct temperature immediately remove it from the heat now you don't have to take it out of the pot I'm pouring in mine into a glass container because it has a little spout that's gonna make it easier to pour but you can also use a spoon to remove it from the pot and put it into your candy molds I let it sit for about 30 seconds just so that foaming action could go down because I don't want too many bubbles in the lollipops and then you're gonna pour it into some candy molds if you have them these I bought online and they are specially designed for high temperature candy making do not use those clear plastic ones that are made for chocolate molding so I put a little bit of the maple syrup a piece of bacon a lollipop stick and then more maple syrup on top until the mold was full and then you let it beat I did spray these molds with just a little bit of cooking spray prior to adding the maple syrup you don't have molds you can do them freeform on a silicon mat or on a piece of greased aluminum foil on a cookie sheet same idea I put a little bit of the maple syrup a little piece of bacon the lollipop stick and in a little bit more maple syrup on top as time goes by it'll see your mixture will start to harden on you if this happens and you can't pour it anymore you can pop that glass container back in the microwave and heat it for about 10-15 seconds until the the maple syrup starts to soften up and gets liquid again and it's pourable once more when you are done let them sit at room temperature until they are nice and hard it takes about 15-20 minutes or so happens pretty fast pop them out of the molds or take them off of the silicone mats and they are ready to eat now as far as all your pots and pans that have all that hard sugar on them just put the whole pan into a sink of hot water or fill it with hot water and within a couple of hours all that sugar will just dissolve all by itself it's quite easy to clean up so I made some with bacon you can see the bacon in the center of the lollipop when you hold it up to the light and I made some without like the one over on the right hand side on your screen these lollipops taste very intensely of maple syrup and it also has a little bit of a caramelized sugar flavor to them they are really really good and very addictive and of course when you get to the center there's a little piece of bacon please see the About section below for some storage instructions thanks for watching what kind of candy do you think I should try next if you have a suggestion please leave it in the comments I've also put all my candy making videos together in a playlist if you want to see those videos go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in

Christmas season well going to begin with merkins cocoa light cocoa dark and white chocolate you can use any color of chocolate or any chocolate coating that you care to use this is a delicious product that is very easy to make candies with now I've already melted some of the cocoa dark and in order to melt this chocolate all you do is you dump the wafers in a microwavable bowl and put them in the microwave at 50% power never more than half power start with one or two minutes and then take them out and just stir them and when you only see a few lumps left that's when you want to stop microwaving it and just stir it until it's completely melted and it's fluid and then you'll know that you're ready to go I have my chocolate mold and in this case I'm using a very simple lollipop mold I've made sure that I've used a soft towel this is like a flowers flower sack towel or at least a linen towel that will not have any dust particles on it and then you want to buff the inside of these molds and that will help give them a really nice shine so we'll just buff those make sure that they're clean and they're well buffed and you're ready to go you'll need some lollipop sticks and these are the I think these are the four and a half inch sticks ready to go yes and follow all we do now is add the chocolate right into the mold try not to overfill them it's better to add a little more after than to try to take chocolate out of the mold and I'm gonna do four of these and one more there we go now to get the air bubbles out you simply drop them on a table and you can see how that filled very very quickly it didn't look like I had a chalk a lot of chocolate in the mold but once you once you drop them and they level out you can see which ones clearly need just a little bit more but it's a lot easier to add it than to have it go over the edge okay after I've dropped it a couple times and I know that the air bubbles are out take the lollipop stick drop it in and then turn it and that completely inroads the lollipop stick into the chocolate and it secures it in there okay I'm done from here I'm gonna put these into the freezer they'll take about five to ten minutes to chill and you'll know they're ready when you feel the back of them when you put your finger on the back and it feels cold you're know they're ready to come out now I've already made some ahead I'm gonna put these in the freezer and bring the other ones up and I'm gonna unload those for you we just did here's the white one and it's cold on the back and you can see how easily they pop out and again they pop right out so now we're just going to put a simple decoration on these and to decorate these today I'm going to use some of the royal icing decorations that we sell at global sugar art and these are ready to use decorations and we have reindeer trees snowman Holly poinsettias there are many many other ones that we carry as well so to add one of these royal decker royal icing decorations onto the chocolate I'm just dipping a paintbrush in a little bit of chocolate I'm going to put a little dab on the lollipop and then just stick that on and I know that didn't stick because the chocolate is cold and it hardened very quickly there we go so if I want to make sure that it doesn't show I'll put it on the back of the of the royal icing decoration let's see what else we can do a little you can see how quick and easy these are this is a great project to do with children or other family members or as a holiday gathering and of course I think we already got Santa well we've done most of them then and we'll do the last one there we go okay so just to repeat the process I melted the chocolate I melted the merkins chocolate in the microwave at half power for it took about a minute to three minutes depending on how much you put in the bowl just scoop it into a buff mole put the drop it on the counter a couple times to get the air bubbles out then add your lollipop stick and turn it and then put them in the freezer for about five to ten minutes when they're done you just pop them out and you can add the decorations the royal icing decorations with a little bit of melted chocolate and then to package these I'm just going to use a clear bag that we sell these are candy makers bags and you just pop that in there and then you can use any sort of a little tie if you want to use a little ribbon of Christmas ribbon these are a great stocking stuffer or even a little placeholder at the Christmas table for a child or even a for adult like me who loves chocolate I would take it any day thanks for watching all the products are available at global sugar are calm and Happy Holidays thank you you", "jqlnTHjnF68": "hi it's Kristin with life more abundant blog.com and today I'm going to show you how to make immune boosting elderberry lollipop so elderberry syrup is known for its immune boosting properties so it's very high in vitamins A and C and research has shown that it can help prevent the flu as well as if you catch it it can lessen the severity of your symptoms as well as cut back on the amount of days that you actually are sick by as much as three or even four days out there very syrup is something that I definitely like to keep on hand especially during this time of year it's January now the Sun is not coming out as much we're inside a lot and those sicknesses are just going around like crazy and so I definitely like to keep this on hand for us to take and to give to my kids as well so putting it in a lollipop form makes it even more simple for me to just hand it to my kids and let them suck on it they think they're getting a special treat while I know they're getting the immune boosting properties of elderberry syrup as well as a couple of the other things that I'm going to be showing you that we're going to put into these lollipops so one of the things that sets these lollipops apart are that we're going to add vitamin d3 into them so I like to supplement with vitamin d3 in the wintertime because you normally get it from the Sun when we're not outside playing like we are in the spring and summer and early fall your body needs more of this and you can supplement with it so this just comes an oil form really simple to use I normally just give my kids my drop a day but I also get I also give them elderberry syrup by combining the two we can just make things a little bit easier another thing we're gonna add to our lollipops are probiotics so I like to use this brand from young living for my kids it's a prebiotic and probiotic supplement and we're going to sprinkle these on the lollipops we're going to put it into the mold before we pour in the elderberry and then we're also going to sprinkle it on the back of them and it's also it's gonna one help their gut flora you know all the good things that probiotics do so good for your kids so good for you I feel like everyone should be on probiotics it's so helpful for immune health and everything so it's gonna serve two purposes it's going to help support their gut flora and you know give them all those benefits that you especially need in the wintertime when your body is trying to fight off all kinds of sicknesses that they that you may come in contact with but it also is going to help keep the lollipops from sticking you'll need silicone molds which I just found these on Amazon they're very inexpensive I'll put them in the description down below and then they actually came with these reusable little plastic lollipop sticks which are great you can just wash them and reuse them so to begin we're just going to combine the three main ingredients the water the honey and the elderberry syrup into a saucepan so we're going to start with our quarter cup of filtered water and then we're going to add a quarter cup of elderberry syrup which I just purchased an organic kind on Amazon and then we're gonna add our half cup of raw local honey you can use any type of honey that you have and when you put it on the stove on medium heat make sure you watch it closely because it can burn and we're gonna get this to hard crack stage so if you're unfamiliar with making candy this is about 300 degrees on a candy thermometer which takes a pretty long time I don't have a candy thermometer so what I like to do is to test it in cold water and so what that looks like is get a glass of cold water with maybe some ice cubes in it once it gets very bubbly really reduced down almost like there's just it's very thick and not super liquidy then that's probably about the time that it's getting to be around 300 degrees or the hard crack stage and what you do is just take a little bit drop it in the cold water and if it kind of forms a ball and sinks to the bottom let it cool for a second you kind of fish it out and if you can kind of crack it or not crack it it's so hard that you can crack it and then that is where we want it to be in order to make these alali pops and if it doesn't get to that point if you if you pour it in the molds before it gets to that point the lollipops will become kind of gooey not really set up and they'll be pretty difficult to eat so let's get this over to the stove heating up over medium heat so once your mixture is at 300 degrees or the hard crack stage you can prepare your mold so put the sticks in sprinkle with probiotic powder you any kind you like I'll link a few of my favorites below and then just fill up with the elderberry syrup and next we're gonna add our vitamin d3 which I just use one drop per lollipop and then we're gonna sprinkle more probiotic powder and then let these set up for about 30 minutes once your elderberry lollipops have set for about 30 minutes it's safe to pop them out of their silicone mold if you find that the lollipops are still a little bit sticky even with the probiotic powder on them you can dip them in a little bit of cornstarch and that will keep them from sticking to things I like to store mine just in a little bat and little baggies and like I said give them to my kids every day I hope you enjoyed this video if you're new to my channel

sweet treats are a favorite of kids and grown-ups alike and with dozens of flavors and colors this is one candy you surely won't get tired of a worker prints artwork on thin sheets of vellum these designs will be printed onto the sucker stick the vellum is placed between special glass and covered with an epoxy that reacts with UV light the plate assembly is then placed into a special UV cabinet for processing once removed from the cabinet a worker carefully scrubs the newly formed epoxy piece first by hand then dishwashing soap and a soft brush go to work to remove more stubborn debris to complete the epoxy stamp it's sent back into the cabinet for a few more minutes what emerges is a completed stamp that will be used to print on the sucker sticks the stamp is loaded onto a metal plate onto the stamping machine a worker ensures that the hopper of blank sticks is kept full in a typical shift the machine can go through nearly 50,000 blank sticks the sticks are printed one at a time as the epoxy stamp rotates on the metal drum the machine can print nearly three sticks per second making quick work of a tedious process the printed sticks drop into a bin below the machine the ink dries nearly instantly leaving the sticks smudge free and looking crisp each batch of sucker starts with glucose which is a fancy name for sugar syrup the glucose is mixed with other secret ingredients before being moved to a copper kettle for cooking the copper kettle is brought to a specific temperature to ensure the proper consistency as the candy cooks [Music] copper kettles are used for their superior heat distribution properties which is important so that the candy doesn't burn after cooking at high temperatures the candy is brought under vacuum using a specially designed copper lid the vacuum removes any moisture that may be present in the candy which helps prevent the candy from cracking or breaking the vacuum is slowly increased to draw out the remaining moisture in the candy a worker stands watch over the kettle to ensure the vacuum is released at just the right moment which is about 26 psi once the vacuum is removed a worker slowly raises the lid from the copper kettle then the worker scrapes the inside of the vacuum lid using a specially designed copper tool care must be taken during this step as the candy is still incredibly hot each batch of candy weighs in at approximately 100 pounds the copper kettle is lifted from the burner using a lift and is moved to a table for further processing it takes two workers to position the kettle and prepare it to empty the candy onto the work table the candy is still hot enough at this stage to be mostly molten one worker positions the candy while the other scrapes the inside of the kettle so that no candy is left behind the candy itself is cooked without flavoring so that the flavoring doesn't become bitter a worker mixes a flavoring syrup with citric acid then spreads it throughout the candy for even coverage this step is what gives the sucker its iconic flavor the worker then rolls the candy up to make it easier to move and then with the help of another worker carries the candy to a roller kneading machine this machine needs the candy to evenly mix the flavoring that was just added after each rotation the worker flips the candy over folding it into the process [Music] the candy is divided into two pieces each approximately weighing 50 pounds this makes the candy easier to work with the folding action helps cool the candy which is still too warm to turn into suckers at this stage it also helps remove any air that may be trapped inside once the candy is cooled sufficiently it is loaded into a roller lined hopper that feeds the machinery which makes the suckers [Music] the angled rollers turn the large candy blobs into a thin rope that can be more easily shaped and formed the newly formed candy rope is fed through a series of rollers towards a cutter that portions the candy in exactly the right size the candy pieces are placed into individual trays before being unloaded into a press assembly the press assembly not only gives the sucker its signature shape but inserts the stick as well it's a highly orchestrated process to make sure the stick gets placed inside the candy disc immediately before shaping here you can see it in slow motion another jig grabs the semi completed sucker to move it on to the next step similar to how the sticks are printed an epoxy mold on a metal drum applies an edible icing to each sucker these stamps last for tens of thousands of suckers before being replaced a roll of cellophane wrap is spooled to another press below that seals each sucker then a mechanical pair of scissors cuts the suckers apart doing the job much faster than a human worker good from here the suckers travel up a conveyor belt to a cooling tunnel where they'll spend the next several minutes this is an important step as the suckers are still warming up at this stage to be molded [Music] once the suckers exit the cooling tunnel they are scooped up by a worker and packaged each box of suckers is packaged by weight now the only thing left to do is to unwrap a sucker and enjoy [Music]", "Z1leste59E4": "[Music] I'm Kelly Sonya from just to taste calm and I bet you didn't know that you can make homemade lollipops with just two ingredients but the key to successful candy making at home is having all of your ingredients set out because caramelized sugar waits for no one combine the sugar corn syrup and water in a small saucepan over medium heat you want to bring the sugar to a boil until it reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack stage and then using a pastry brush dipped in water wipe around the sides of the pan to loosen any sugar crystals once the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit and immediately submerge the pan in a bowl of ice water and this will stop it from cooking and this is the point when you want to work really quickly because the sugars gonna harden almost instantly pour the sugar into two to three inch circles on your lined baking sheet and then immediately place the lollipop sticks and sprinkles on top and there you have it homemade lollipops just switch up the sprinkles to match your holiday for more recipes and tips check out just to taste calm [Music] you", "y1yoxvTyn6c": "hey guys welcome to gingham and grit also part of twisted grapevines i'm kim beckmeyer and it's friday night in august in texas here i'm gonna go ahead just hit the glue gun and i'm gonna go ahead and make sure i'm sharing the right link with my other social media so hang on just a second i think i did it right it's been a while since i've done youtube live so usually i'm uploading to youtube so i just wanted to make sure i was doing it right um it has been a long long long week so we just started back at school and we just heard that from our school board this week that they've extended virtual learning for another two weeks so we're going to the 21st of september which is a good thing but um high school and virtual learning is it's a challenge it's a challenge for everybody it's a challenge for parents it's challenge for kids challenge the teachers so we all just have to give a lot of grace but i tell you i'm wiped out today um so what i have been promising to do i did a youtube video on the lollipops and the yarn balls using the chenille yarn so we've done these and then i started looking and i started seeing these other sweets and lollipops and candies out there the fakes and i've been really impressed by them all and haven't had a whole lot of time to get to delve and because some of that stuff out there i think is truly artwork some of the donut i saw someone had made some fake donuts today and i've seen the sundaes and other things in just quite beautiful pieces and um i'm not anywhere near there yet but i did watch probably about six or seven videos and i've kind of adapted my own own way of doing these so um laura with um she did a video and she used uh actually i did this candy based on her method she cut single strips three-fourths or i think hers were an inch i did mine three-quarters of an inch so i cut two colors strips three-quarter inch and just rolled them and you get this kind of and then i did the ends and i'll show you how to do the ends and you get this kind and i brushed it a little bit with some glitter i don't think i decoupaged this one i was just kind of playing with it but i really like the tight swirl of the two colors now mind you one side of it's really pretty the other side has a little bit it's not quite so flat and perfect and that's just because how you cut and that's okay and this was my very first attempt there's a little bit of glue on here plus it fell on the floor so it picks up a lot of the dirt off the floor unfortunately sorry that's kind of embarrassing but um so there's that right there like that so there's the good side and i just put with my pick i just put this and then i mounted this so it'll pop up in a room so that's what i did with that one and then i was watching another one and i started looking at it and i was like gosh there their things are a little bit thicker and so i sat there and i started digging through some of my supplies from last year that i didn't use and pardon me really quick i came up with this one so i found these candies that i had bought at wreath makers live and this pack of six was 12.50 and i think now after i figured out how to make these i think this is a really good price because let me pop this up but i'm going to show you unless this is craft foam that is striped i think they made it this way and i have to actually feel it i haven't i can't tell i think it might be yeah maybe it is that way i can't tell i can't tell if this was glued like they just cut half inch strips this way and glued them all together and then cut their strips the other way to get these stripes but if they did all that work then heck yeah this is worth 12.50 for six of them because oh my gosh that would be a ton of work so i don't know if they did that now if you look at this piece right here there's a curled edge on this side a rolled edge and a rolled edge on this side so i was watching i think it was scott waterman who did it and they cut their piece say like this and they folded both ends to the middle so i guess they cut this one wider and they rolled this up no i think they did about one and a half so they glued these down i think he might have used double-sided tape and i even bought some double-sided tape but this stuff didn't want to stay down mine didn't this was stronger and maybe if i was using the glitter stuff the glitter stuff is thinner and maybe that might have worked i'll have to try that i just got the glitter and i didn't realize it was thinner but it's thinner but so this was they folded inside like this to create a folded edge here and a folded edge here and then they would roll it up this way which is what i think this one did so you would have a rolled edge on both sides so if you were putting it in say for instance a centerpiece or something like that where both sides were visible i would understand the need for the double edge however if it's going on a wreath i made an adaption so i just took mine and instead of folding both sides in i just folded them in half so i cut these one and a half inch wide and then i just folded in half and so i have a rough edge here and the folded edge here which i really like this method and so if you look at this side i didn't treat this side actually use a cable mount tie to tie this onto your wreath we put this in our witches wreath um you'll see this side it's kind of a little and even a little rough this is the non-rolled side and then this side has the folded edge on it and then i dusted it with um the shiny the gloss modge podge and then i used the um extra fine iridescent glitter on top of it so be careful you don't og don't over glitter because i did that on one of them and it it doesn't change the color but it alternated it it went as vibrant as i wanted it to be it didn't pop like i thought and also i'm thinking i want to make these a little bit bigger too i want to make them these were two by two squares and i think i'm going to do three by two tonight we'll play and see because i like them if you'll see right here they're a bit fatter i like the fatter ones on those so it's a learning process it's me deconstructing and trying to figure out how to do all these and like i said i came up this is my way of doing it i just fold it in half but this side will never be seen because it's going on a wreath so my stuff is usually going on a wreath and so therefore i can you know shortchange a little bit and make it go a little bit faster because as laurie jacob says time is money and so we want to be careful and mindful of all that so as i was saying i cut these at an inch and a half wide and so i bought these right here from hobby lobby and i think they're what are these i think they're 18 by 12 maybe yeah these are 12 by 18 pieces of foam and you get them in all sorts of colors they're 99 cents you can buy them in packs um so just however you want to do it and then originally i didn't buy the sparkle because i was thinking i was gonna just single cut them and i was like well if i'm rolling them this way there's no sparkle on the edge so why would these are extra 50 cents why would i spend the extra money if you're not going to see the sparkle but if i'm folding them in half like i did right here you see the sparkle so um i went ahead and bought some the other day the only thing is is i wanted this green color and i haven't found the green and the sparkle yet that's what i really wanted because i wanted to do these three for this um gingerbread thing we have i wanted to do those three i still may do it and use this one and just you know do the decoupage the mod podge on it but um but there's a lot of pretty colors like i thought this would be this emerald's really big this year for christmas it was a really pretty involved like look at this red this is just really cute look at that red and green beautiful you could do a lot of fun candies with that you can even pick a white with it too you could do a three that's her um my business partner rivet um other part of twisted grapevines she i was going okay so do you want me to do you know green and orange orange and purple purple green she's like yes i was like okay look at all three so we did all three on this one and i think it came out really really cute all right so here's this guy right here okay and so um that's what we're gonna do so i'm gonna pan down i did just get um a new thing uh i or a new cordless um glue gun or ryobi for my birthday this week and if any of you guys i haven't even looked at my my facebook or anything all week i kid you not it has been so crazy at work this week with this virtual school stuff that i haven't even like to see anything but anyways my sweet husband got me a cordless uh ryobi glue gun and he got me two battery packs for it rechargeable battery packs but he forgot to get the charger so the charger is on its way and so anyways i'm still using this one and every time i feel the the cord on this i go oh i'm getting ready to get rid of that i'm so excited so anyways i'm gonna pan down and show you how i cut these and then how we build these so here we go so you can make all your own sweets for this holiday season all right so if you don't um can't see or you need a better explanation let me know so and i apologize my work area is a hot mess um so i'm gonna put this i'm gonna just line up this in and this in here and then see that and it's not gonna be perfect i tried to get these perfect and i was using a ruler and everything and it just doesn't go perfect put my phone over here all right so i got this really nice metal ruler i was wanting the quilter's ruler that was 18 inches can i want to so i probably need to order one i just didn't have time so i'm going to measure up from my baseline one and a half inch i'm going to put this side here and i'm going to do it on this side here all right and then i'm going to use my rotary cutter and then just glide it right along and i'm pressing down i tried cutting two at once and i really need to replace my rotary and blade and so two just wasn't cutting it now yeah the one cutting up that so i need to do i need to get new blades in here i hate putting new blades in though because i always cut myself when i put new ones in because it's so sharp and i've been dealing with the dull one for so long all right so i'm going to go up another one and a half inch so when i fold one and a half inches it'll give me three quarter inches all right oops but of course it doesn't get as clean okay so there we go all right so then what you once you get these cut one and a half inches you want to take your edges right here and we're gonna use glue or hot glue and we're just gonna run a thin bead i love this kind of glue gun because it's got that really thin point right there and then we're just gonna match them up and just hold it for a second the foam um it dries pretty quick so you don't have a whole lot of time to play with it and i kind of hold it there for just a little bit and i've got pretty calf's fingers and i just kind of pull the excess glue off okay and i've already glued these two together so i'm gonna do four pieces together because i made this one and just a smaller one it was three colors and i used four pieces all together and i got two two candies out of it so i had to reverse the colors on them because you'll use more since the purple's the outer color you'll use more of the purple so i reverse it on the other way these matched up pretty good sometimes you glue them together and they don't match up so bright and you're like whoa what happened to that cut job okay so i'm gonna glue and hold these here real quick and those of you who are joining in if you have not subscribed i would really appreciate if you could do that for me that would be awesome let's see here okay so i've got four strips right here and once you get the strips on there that one's looking i'm going to start on the other end just because it's going to be a little bit there all right we're going to run glue and like i said you could fold them if you wanted the the folded edges on both sides you could do it this way you fold this side in and that side in but um that's kind of long so i'm going to run glue right here toward my edge and i'm just folding mine straight in half you don't want to be right on the edge because then the glue is going to seep out and it's okay if it seeps out because it's on the cut edge it doesn't matter but you might burn yourself and that that does matter i'm not a big fan of burning myself even though my fingers are pretty i don't know we all say we don't have fingerprints anymore crafters because we you get the glue guns kind of burning off the hot glue does okay now the craft foam is pretty darn forgiving so if you mess up you can usually pull it apart and fix it so i'm just holding it down just kind of smooth it over and if it pops open just put a little bit more glue right there yeah i was going to wait till tomorrow afternoon and do this live and i was like i'm awake i've been wanting to do this you know how sometimes you just have things that loom over your head and it's like if i don't get this done i'm not going to rest like i said i've been wanting to do this always and they're just buzzing at time and i'm not for sure i think tomorrow night we're going live i'm not for sure it might be today's husband's perfect i don't remember if it is i'll go live um i've got a what i want to do i need to do it i want to do but i've got a real pretty cheetah print [Music] sorry brain just totally locked up there um awareness cancer breast cancer awareness week that i'm going to be so i had cassie who paints a lot of signs for me she painted and i gave her a picture off of the ribbon and i said can you make a sign out of this does that of course because i wanted the colors reversed now and so of course she did it splendidly all right so we're just going along this like i said i did it some where i put the glue out kind of in the middle and that didn't work out super great because it tends to pop open if you put it your glue too close to the middle so you want it a little bit toward the edge but not super close to the edge where it'll spit out if that makes sense because that's you know an official crafting trim spinning out all right yeah we're all starting to get the hang i teach high school math and so we're all starting to get the hang of the virtual classroom it'll be interesting monday nights are open house and we have to do it virtually so we were having to make you know introduction videos we're going to be doing zoom meetings for parents and they get a google doc to sign in on and i'm just like oh my gosh that's just crazy all right and part of my lights just dimmed i just noticed and i taken my other light source afterwards because i had to do my video for the parents but i tell you what is exhausting is looking at like three computer screens and a phone and just constantly all day long of just being bombarded with messages and oh goodness and i know it's got to be just as crazy for the kids having to find where everything is and we're all trying to do things real similar so the kids don't have to look in a million when places but big gracious think it's so confusing i know they gotta be confused their parents are confused it's just it's just hard and you just miss seeing your kids face to face i can't learn their names real well because i can't see them i mean i see you know a tiny screen but not very much of them so it's hard to it's hard to really remember except you know like if they need tutoring and they hang out afterwards with you and then you get to kind of talk a little bit because high school kids are so much fun to talk to and they break down the walls and kind of show who they are okay so i've got i'm gonna do one in the third power that dripped on the thing that drip glued down onto that there you go sorry about that so this part of my hand doesn't is it couched all right so i'm gonna do two different ones i'm gonna do one in threes and then i'm gonna do one in the glitters i haven't done the glitters before so i'm gonna do this way um so i've got the purple folded i've got the orange and i've got the green now when you start these so you want to make sure all the folded edges are on the same thing and i'm going to start with one first and i'm going to put just a little bit of glue right here in the center like that and i'm going to just tuck it over super tight and i'm going to hold it cinches there getting the very beginning super tight because you don't want to have gaps in it uh that's probably this is the hardest part is getting it tight and it's really kind of tricky with the three i didn't have so much problem with this one as i did with the other one like this okay so i get that one in and now i'm gonna come in and i'm gonna butt the i'm gonna bet the orange right up next to that curved end right there and if you want to put a little drop of glue to kind of help it hold it in place make sure you just put it in the middle because you don't want it spitting out i hope i didn't get too much right here yeah i'm good all right so see how i kind of just put that right there i'm gonna hold that and let it go down pretty tight okay and then i'm going to take my green and i'm going to stack my green in here too i'm going to just pull it yeah i'm going to just move it down about it looks like a quarter to an eighth inch right behind it so i'm gonna put a little drop of glue right there to kind of give me a little bit maneuverability i'm gonna hold it and see if you can see right there a little bit better so i'm gonna hold it right there as well see if i can pull this down just a little more nastier work area sorry guys okay so let's see start rolling like i said you want to keep it tight here at the beginning you're going to keep it tight for the whole thing okay i've got a little gap right there so i'm gonna go backwards a little bit and i'm gonna try and kick that a little bit tighter like i said this is the hardest part right here all right so i'm gonna actually put it down here on the table so i can have my rough edges are up so the fold side is down so it's all even down on that side because this is the back okay so see what i have right there whoops can you see all right so real tight so it actually works better to start on the bottom of the table i mean turning it upside down so i am just carrying this out here and we're just spinning it around and you're keeping it super tight you're holding it down on your flat table and like i said you'll feel your uneven cuts back here that it's being flat on the front and like i said i put mine on wreaths some people put these in plastic so i don't think the back would show either if you're feeling more sorry there's more of those if you're putting it in plastic you know like a plastic bag a decorative type thing and then tie me that i don't think that would be bad either if you have the the rough back it just seems like it would take a lot of time to to glue two sides down because you saw i mean that wasn't like super long to do that one color but it could it could start making it okay so we're just spinning eat some good music okay so that looks like a good size i mean you can make it bigger if you want to i mean just wherever you're putting i mean it's going to make a statement wherever you do it so just kind of you know wherever you want to finish it i'm going gonna go i'm gonna i'm gonna stop right here so i'm gonna you're gonna cut it in stages so i'm gonna cut the green one the one closest on the inside first and then i'm gonna put a tiny drop of glue right there in the middle okay and just kind of like we staggered it in the beginning we're gonna stagger it here as well so and if you keep this really tight you don't need to put glue anywhere in the middle as you roll all right so i'm going to cut this about it looks like oh let's say about a quarter of an inch longer than the green and i'm gonna put a tiny bit of drop of glue right there as well in the middle and we're gonna push down and hold it for a second and then i'm going to come with the purple the final color right and i'm going to make it just a little bit longer than the orange like i said we're staggering all of these about a quarter of an inch oops i didn't stagger that one very much probably should have done that one a little bit more it should have been a little bit longer oh well we're gonna put the candy tie right there anyways so it's not gonna i usually like to pull it a little bit longer so that way it's not quite so breast of a end right there i like it to taper a little bit more but that was me sorry a big old finger was in the way all right so that's what the three does so that's what you get it looks really pretty all right i'm gonna hold that just a little bit longer i'm gonna kind of mash it here in the middle make sure it's all flush to the front okay so once you're here you have a choice you have a choice of whether you want to make a lollipop or whether you want to make a candy so if you want to make a lollipop i use um i use my ice pick right here and right here where this piece is i would insert you know drill a hole right here and then i would use these guys right here you get these um i found these at walmart bamboo skewers in the um what is it the kitchen utensil area and right where you drilled that hole i would take the pointy end and put a drop of glue on it and insert it in there okay so that's how i would make a lollipop um and then i bought i think it was cindy who taught me this trick let me grab this really quick i found these on amazon because i was making a lot a bunch of lollipops for one of our reef kits and i got tired of wrapping ribbon and she's like look you know you can buy straws so i got this box 200 straws from amazon and it's got eight colors in it so you know you pick your color and i just put a drop of glue at the top and i just and i put it up to where it meets and then i cut the bottom and then i just put glue right there and look how cute that is i mean like if you have that inserted right like that that would be so cute and you don't have to wrap a shortcut so really like that trick so i've been using that trick a whole lot i like that one okay so i'm gonna do the candies on this one so i'm gonna use a piece of craft foam and like i said when i did this one right here and all the videos i watched they made these two by two squares but i like i think i want this a little bit wider so i think i'm gonna try a three by two tonight and i'm gonna get pinking shears as well so you know the ones that cut the zigzag all right then i'm gonna cut three of my four sides using those so let's see here we're gonna do all right i'm just using my scissors so one two three and then we want to do two i was like what is that and it's the tag that's weird feeling okay so on these right here i'm gonna go ahead and cut i'm gonna leave one edge long because that's going to be where we fit in i'm going to go ahead and paint the others so whatever color is on the outside that's the color on the little wrapper all right so we're going to fold this guy in half so fold it in half and i'm going to put just a little drop of glue right there at the end you don't want to carry your glue too far out because then it's going to be real long and skinny and i like them short and fat like see this one i made it too long i took my glue too far out i like them where they're just short okay and then i'm going to put a drop right here on the back and then we're going to follow this piece down we're going to do the same thing on the other side oops stay and put a drop right there we're gonna fold this piece back so you're gonna fold it in half and then fold it each side in half again so it's really in force all right ooh i like that a lot better yeah i like it wider so you can either put your curl this way or you can put your curl that way it just depends on which look you want um i kind of like it with the ridges up so i'm going to take this one i'm going to put glue on this end right here and where that was you know that sharp end right there i'm gonna put it right there a little hot not too bad but a little bit i use um multi-temp so i try to use the the cooler not the super super hot glue i accidentally i ran out of glue and i had pulled from an old bag and it was hot high temp glue and this is a multi-temp and you know i just assumed it was still oh good gracious it took forever i had a burn right there it took forever for that thing to heal that was not fun okay so that's what we have right here so let's do one more of these so i'm gonna once again i'm gonna pink the one one long edge and the two short edges and if you want these you know shorter you can always trim them i've trimmed some before so we're gonna put a little bit of glue right there in the middle i'm gonna need some more glue that's the thing i gotta get for my new glue gun too i gotta get some glue because this is these use those little mini sticks and my new one uses the big ones so hopefully i won't have to be refinishing blue quite so much so where always herpes is always like okay some more glue yeah oh shoot i stuck my finger right in there i tried wearing those little finger fingertip cards and it just doesn't work for me i've got to feel it which means you can feel all of it unfortunately all right so i'm pinching this and holding it or as rhonda says pin to it okay and i'm gonna put some glue right here and then i'm gonna go straight across this one and hold it in place make sure that they're both going the same direction both of these have the crimped edges going up like i said you could have made them go the other way it's just personal choice so there we go there's our little our candy for tonight that's using three and like i said if you're putting this on a wreath so here's what the back looks like so see i don't think that would be bad if you packaged it in plastic like right here so like say i had a clear plastic bag say this was a lollipop or something and you were to put it in the bag you know and tie it at the string like i don't think that would show like here's this side with the thing i don't think that would show it's so much faster to do to do just the one fold and the two so i mean it's just kind of like i said personal choice all right okay so i'm going to do and i tell you what to if you if your um craft tabletop is as dirty as mine gets it will pick up every piece of bread in your your table so um the pick the ice picks really good for picking out the stuff so let's go ahead while this is here and let's go ahead and um let's decorate it for modules so i don't like to use my super good brushes with mod podge because modge podge is like a glue so in case i forget to go wash it right away or if it gets crusty you know these little cheap ones you can get these at the dollar tree now which is really nice all right okay so i'm just gonna like well there you go we might need to put a little glue on this one to hold this guy on there i haven't had that happen before it's alive so it's going to happen right it seems to thank you all right so we're just gonna i'm gonna actually do my sides so i'm gonna go here on my sides you know get ready because you're gonna get it on youtube so it just and i try to go in here and if i have any of the the crevices or whatnot i try to fill them up it just adds a little bit reinforcement so it doesn't come undone and go in here and do this as well like i said can you really over glitter i don't know and you can glitter the back you want to if it's going to show on both sides this is only going to show on the front so i'm going to probably not do the back just because i don't have to put this glue on the back except we require you doing two different things all right so we're just going to cover this in mod podge like i said i got the shiny and i didn't even know they made shiny i think it was lara who mentioned the shiny lara jean and i was like oh didn't even know they knew china we're just used to the mod podge from the 70s where we would cut up calico strips and put them on plaster do i remember some of those who are all i'm old um old as me and we used to oh that was a craft we used to do with our moms all the time and it was um you cut old calico scraps and i remember we had this dog and uh you cut them up and you use pinking shears to cut them and then you would decoupage them on there or mod podge i think i got one of those in a white elephant gift one year for christmas when i was older when sam my husband and i went to a white elephant christmas party and here i am now you know playing with decapod or mod podge i always call it decoupage it's hard to call it mod podge all right so i'm gonna put this aside so i kind of did it lightly i didn't do it real you know real thick i don't want glitter snowballs okay so i'm gonna take this and i'm gonna just dust it like i said i have this real fine um it's real fine glitter dust i have this iridescent dust and the fine i have it in a not fine the not fine ones i use on what do i use on the chenille lollipops get the edges here you know just put on something that you can collect the glitter because i do reuse but falls off i'll get crafters reuse so here we go so it looks really light right now but when you um when it dries this is going to dry the mod podge dries clear and the sparkle shows so i'll show that right here so that's what we have so far okay so this is what it looks like when it dries so it goes from this too so the colors become really vibrant when it dries i really like that about the and that's that's because of the shiny that and the iridescent makes it pop a little bit too okay i feel like i'm in class and i say all right are there any questions that's what i've been doing all week okay does anyone have any questions before i move on all right so i'm going to go ahead and collect some of my glitter right here i want to do one more with the already glitter material because i haven't used that yet so that'll be this will be made in voyage with that stuff okay so let's see here and i was going to tell you too with these leftover pieces right here i think the green one fell down over here this one so now the green is the longest you can repeat the procedure fitting the green on the outside going this way and you'll finish with the green on the outside and you can get a whole other lolli i mean candy out of this one so oh hi angie oh thank you so much i have made and i actually did a tutorial with the yarn as well so like i did the balls and like here the lollipops so i did those too and um i i was watching something and i was like okay those are different and i was looking at them really close and so i go what are those made out of and i sat there and i looked and i go i think they're made out of foam and so i um i ended up watching like six or seven videos and i kind of came up with my own little method of how to do this so that this one right here was done on a single cut so this is three quarter cut three-quarter inches two colors and just rolled tight this was cut on an inch and a half but it's folded so this inch or this edge right here is um a folded edge and then the back side is a cut edge so because i use all of mine in wreaths i just use a cable mount on the back and do it like that if you want a lollipop you know of course don't put these ends on and you know put the stem right there but i use the shiny mod podge to give it that that really bright it really makes it pop and then use that iridescent fine glitter so that's what i do on those now this one right here i didn't make this one i actually bought this one this one the fold is on front and back so you could use this on something that you were going to see you know 360 all the way around like a centerpiece or something and so on that one i watched someone do a video and i'm looking for a strip of folded online but what they did on theirs was you would fold it in on this side and then you would fold it you know in on this side and then you would roll it that way so that's kind of what that one how that one was done right there they folded like that which to me is a lot of folding and a lot of glue and a lot of potential to burn myself um i saw one where they they put double-sided tape in the middle and then they folded it there but i couldn't get this stuff to hold it was i tried but i went having a lot of success with it so anyways i i just like the single fold because the rough side i won't it won't show on what i use it for and then you know and i do i did three colors and i'm getting ready to do one with two so this i haven't used before this is new so i cut i think three strips on this one the long strips and this already had the glitter on it i really wanted to do these three colors for something a project i'm working on but this one i haven't found yet in the glitter so i've got to check one more spot that may have it so i'm gonna just do these two tonight so let's see if we can get these going all right so when you start these you want to stagger them so you want one a little bit longer than the other all right and then you're going to start rolling and you want it super duper tight so i'm going to put it down here on my table because i may have not cut them super great so i want the part that's facing down on the table to be all the same length so if there's any parts like my glue for my fingers is coming off so if any parts are uneven they'll show up on the back not on the front we've got a new kit coming out soon we just got the gingerbread we have painted for us and it's in pink red white and the green and so that's why i was wanting to put the different colors i was thinking of putting the red with this too but i don't like the red with the white and the pink maybe the oh i bet the red and the pink yeah okay that's what i'm gonna do next so this one i don't think i'm gonna make it on this one i think i'll make a lollipop on this one i don't know let me do it so when you curl it you just want to make sure it's super tight as you curl it and um so you don't have holes in there and like i said we're keeping i can see i see my little bumps all back here okay so i think i only cut two strips of or three i think i cut three strips of the white i don't know why i didn't cut four probably i got distracted because that's where my head is today after a long week at work okay all right so that's how far we got like i said it picks up a lot of stuff off your table so i'm going to flip it over ooh that looks cool i like that look how pretty that looks right there that came out cute and it's already glittered so i don't have to glitter it okay so i'm gonna my white one ended right here so i'm gonna cut this about half an inch longer i may not need it a full half inch it may go more like three eighths and i'm going to put a little drop in the middle of glue you don't want to put too much because you don't want it to seep out both sides like that right there might okay and then we're just gonna hold it now so angie when you made your yarn and lollipops did you use the big yarn or did you use just the regular yarns or did you use that big chunky yarn i've done them both where's one right here i did um like i did this one for halloween these are in the little the little yarns i like the big and like here's the ball in the little yarns i got there's that double-sided tape so i did those and then i love mixing the the jude with it that'll really like doing because i've got a real retro halloween wreath that has a lot of the muted colors that i was going to put these two guys in but i like but i really do love the chunky the chunky's just just so bubbly okay look i have blue from that i think that's the mod podge all right so there's that guy right there so i'm gonna take this my i'm gonna just go in right there so i'm just jabbing it in and then i'm gonna take one of my um bamboo skewers from walmart the kitchen section and i'm gonna put hot glue on it and i'm gonna just kind of twist it in there we're going to let that dry and then i was telling them that i bought sam's club this box of 200 and it has eight colors in it let's see if my pink smells like they match okay so so then i'm gonna take this guy right here i'm gonna put a drop well let me put it on here first all right and i'm gonna put a little bit of glue here at the top of it and then smash it all these great verbs to not smash jab sounds so violent and then i put a drop of glue down here too if i need this to um mount in a wreath i keep it on there but more than likely i'm cutting it off but it's there all right so i'm going to go ahead and put the glue and if you wanted to you could put a real pretty bow right there as well where the straw meets the edge that's so cute oh my gosh and i got the cutest ribbon i'm gonna get that from i got a trendy treat but it's white with crimped um pink it's cut with the pink shears oh it's so super sweet but is it white it might be cream it may not work maybe you may just have to get a pink oh darn i've got to go look for ribbon you know i hate that so anyway so there's that one so this is done with the fold both of these were done with the fold that i made tonight and um that's just something i kind of created from watching all the videos i watched but you can make them also like i said in this singular these are pretty too but you could do them with the candy i like it with the wider so i do i do like we did these three by two so i like the wider cut and then this is with the the lollipop all right so that's what i got for you guys tonight i'm going to do another one tomorrow so let me lift up real quick so nice so there we go i guess i can squat all right so tomorrow i'm going to do one during the day i've had a lot of people ask how i make my pumpkins so i'm going to do tutorial i have i did a pumpkin and i love mustard so and this has kind of it's almost like a sear sucker because it's got the puckers on it so i'll make one of these i've got an order for some cheetah so i will make a cheetah one i'll make a couple different sizes and use some different types of fabric so you can see how they work and then i use real dried pumpkin stems that i got on ebay so i will do that tutorial tomorrow and i think tomorrow night we are doing a breast cancer awareness wreath so that when i think summer facebook live but i'm gonna do another youtube with the pumpkins so anyways lots of fun of the i've been having a lot of fun making all these um attachments for wreaths so i think they're just so fun and plus it you can do them really quick and it's like you've got something you've accomplished whereas a wreath sometimes takes a while to do so it's kind of fun to have something all finished so anyways oh you use chunky yarn too yeah i love the chunky yarn i think it's really cute and it's hard to find right now so i ran out of um wife the other day and oh my gosh i had to go to so many stores to find white it just nobody had white everybody's using it so um i really like the chunky one i think it's plus it goes so fast because when you do the little yarn oh my goodness it takes a long time but the big one you're done you have to make that sound too when you do it um so hope you can come join us tomorrow and like i said i'll do it on youtube the pumpkins and then tomorrow night we'll be doing breast cancer witness so hope to see you then y'all have a great friday night rest after year long week i know i'm going to and it was 107 degrees in texas today in the metroplex dallas fort worth it was so hot so i'm escaping to the roof room and just it takes it out of here so hope y'all have a great weekend and pop by and say hi and i'll see you later all right good night you", "T3xgRZfAEak": "how to make sea salt caramel lollipops [Music] hello everyone starting off with a medium-sized saucepan and in the saucepan you'll place one cup of white granulated sugar activat 2 tablespoons or an ounce of water a teaspoon of lemon juice a teaspoon of sea salt and a quarter cup of white or light colored corn syrup the addition of the corn syrup will help keep it from crystallizing too quickly and will make mixture smoother now stir this together over medium-high heat until it starts to boil once this starts the ball you're gonna add in 1/4 cup or four tablespoons of butter a little bit at a time so what I did is I took some cold butter cut it into cubes and then I'm just adding one one or two cubes at a time and stirring until the butter is melted and I continue to add the butter until it was completely combined in there and then you're gonna cook it on medium high boiling it until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit which is the hard crack candy stage and be careful when it starts to change color that's when you know you're getting close to the correct temperature and if you start getting some scorching you may have to move it off the heat a little bit but chances are it'll coincide almost exactly when it starts to get the caramel color as the time it'll be at the right temperature once it gets to be the right temperature take it off the heat and stir in a teaspoon of vanilla extract now you're gonna spoon your hot caramel mixture into some candy molds these are special molds just for high temperature candy making do not use those clear plastic ones that use for chocolate molding because they'll just melt they'll lose their shape make sure you get the hard candy ones I actually found mine online so just to Google hard candy mold you probably get quite a few buying options if you can't get them at your local hobby store i greased these molds very lightly with a little bit of cooking spray prior to filling them in I put in the candy sticks and when you're filling the mold make sure that you cover the stick with caramel so that it's nicely put together I did some heart molds I did these happy face molds these ones are probably a little bit too big for caramel cuz the caramel is a little it takes a little long time to eat compared to regular hard candy I get some little round ones which I think are the perfect size for this type of candy let them Harden and then don't pull them up by the sticks flex the mold a little bit and if they should just pop out quite nicely now if you like and I recommend it sprinkle on it's just a little bit more sea salt on top of the lollipops when they're done that salt will stick to them and you will have a really nice treat sweet and salty together is a amazing flavor and these are absolutely delicious they taste a lot like the Werther's original caramel candies if you've ever had those now store these in between layers of plastic wrap and make sure that you lay them flat I found that you stand them up oh after 2 or 3 days especially the large ones like these happy face ones they will start to droop over a little bit because all the caramel is hard it's not super hard and will Bend with gravity over a couple of days but I doubt that these will last this long because they're really good I hope you give them a try now if you don't have a hard candy mold or don't want to buy them or don't have the money to buy them there is another way and I've made lollipops without a mold in the past so here's the video on your screen right now if you want to go take a look this would work with the caramels as well but the finish on your candy may not accept that extra little sprinkle of salt after because of the cornstarch go and check this out if you're interested thanks for watching", "erJjlf6xJtY": "Ha, ha, ha, ha ha.

Ha, ha, ha.", "L5G9a2t8IKI": "hello I am Jacques Torres from Jacques Torres chocolates for howdini and today we're going to talk about chocolates chocolate and kids first let's talk about chocolates dark chocolates has a lot of good things for your health and lately we talked a lot about 60% 70% 80% what is that percentage basically what that means is how much are our chocolates from the cacao beans is into that chocolate this chocolate is a 60% cocoa contents 60% of that come from a cacao beans the rest is sugar and a little bit of licit in perhaps sometimes some milk also for milk chocolates so now I tempered that chocolate and I'm going to show you how to make lollipops kids can do that with you it's a fun thing I have some mold that came from a company called life of the party you can find that into the internet I put some chocolate bottom into those mold let me show you a more little bit closer here this one so those mold are almost disposable they are not very expensive and what we do we put chocolates in here and the battle in here we don't put any fat or anything into the mold chocolate will crystallize and shrink out of the mode naturally so just keep your mode very clean that's the most important so I put a baton like that the next step is very sample take a piping bag and if you don't want to use a piping bag you can use a spoon take the chocolate with a spoon and drop it into the cavity of the lollipops you go little bit faster with those piping bag put the chocolates into the bag just like that then squeeze the top of the bag and the last thing that you have to do is to put the chocolate into the cavities here remember to put a little bit of chocolates on top of the bottle just like I do remember to temper your chocolates all the time otherwise the chocolates will never come out of the mold then you have to give the lollipops with the mold the next step for that going to be going to tap those molds so take them all on your hands by tapping those mold very slowly like that the top became very smooth okay so now I'm going to put those mold into a rack and then are going to leave them into the refrigerator for about ten minutes so ten minutes pass and the chocolates are ready so the first thing that I want to show you is when you turn the mold you will see here a little place where the chocolate doesn't retract yet you see it's a little bit darker but I know that by pulling the the bateau here they will retract completely you see it opening in front of you here up that's it now the mold is coming out so basically what's going on here is that the chocolate crystallized the chocolate shrink a little bit and how that happen is when you male chocolates the molecular fat will break down and then you have to put them back together now remember that you can do different color you can put white there this is a gift this is a little snowflake so you can do a lot of different things with it then you can put them into a little bag put a little ribbon around it and those are beautiful gift to give to the family to the front of the kids to the school and they are pretty fun and easy to make eat a lot of chocolates is good for you I am Jacques Torres for howdini thank you", "6T1VjGSk2y4": "it's a video I'm vide one I can't hear what you just now get a sucker what else did you get your backpack there's a backpack what else did you get a watermelon oh my gosh that's awesome a couch whoo-hoo sitting next to you oh my gosh yeah say Merry Christmas what", "HnUZbSMQRfo": "hi everybody are you guys doing new camera new setup new lights same hands same business dawg are you making some little candies today this is what they're gonna look like they're like three quarters whatever you can use them for wreaths ornaments candy Garland's birthdays any holiday you're gonna do them in two colors you can do them in three colors yeah I don't know if you could do them in four that seems like it might be pushing it but you do you I'm using this sticky back foam right here you can use any kind of sticky back foam you want or even any kind of foam you want because I got this just because I thought a general and that's the only place I could go at the time and you come six one inch pieces of this and you pair that with another color and you can get six of these and each sheet is 20 cents of 40 cents you get six of these little candies that you can stick up sucker sticking like a lollipop sticking and wrapping plastic you can do whatever you want so you don't need the sticky back it's quicker it's easier it's a little neater but you can buy regular foam cut it and then just hot glue it together all right so let's get started to put these over here how much you guys could see all over here cuz it's like mostly clean been doing I've done orange and black I've done this kind of green fluorescent yellow green in black and I'm gonna do black and purple so I got my cutting mat down and this is something you don't need but if this is something you have go in where is this thing oh it's right there in the shape shape cut by June Taylor this is used to cut fabric into strips very easily very efficiently and very quickly I used it because I'm terrible at measuring things and cutting and you know so what you're gonna do is if you can see down here quick quick little tutorial there's these little notches and the six button on sets go in six across here we need to cut our strips at one inch and since that blade does not want to fill it in the first time I just go together you get six trucks like in seconds this is super handy if you I use this when I was like strip piecing things you know cuz you need a lot of like two and a half inch pieces of fabric these are not like this ones hanging over just a little bit so it's not perfect but it's not gonna make a difference hang it up over here where it goes because now it has a place instead of just being thrown somewhere we've got our pieces it's gonna make six candies in total and these are very easy to do especially if you have this feedback phone right here and here's a one by its 1x9 right so how we're gonna do this I'm gonna have to move my camera if I go whether it is too weird I'm gonna unpeel the back like halfway and we want these doubled so I'm just gonna fold it in half trying to get it fold it as neatly as possible and I kind of did like assembly line on these I cut all my strips folded all my strips glued all my strips together meet all my candies and then glittered everything so there's half of our candy right there and you can see it gets kind of like it's not straight don't don't work with that I mean I did obsessively into the poem over just like I have just got to get over this have your garbage can near I see you not just throwing stuff all over the place because then your mom will come over and she'll yell at you and say oh my god what's wrong with you with the black I love the way this stuff smells and I think it's a phone because I bought some oh I bought some regular foam from Walmart a while ago for a different project and it it has the same smell but this one smells a little bit stronger but it's also a little bit cheaper like the stuff from Walmart doesn't have all these pores in it I don't know if that's gonna you can't really see that scale it's just like a it's not a texture but it's just like it's got little pores in it pretty much alright so we've got our two pieces I'm gonna grab me a clamp from right in here this is a little dollar tripping lamp not necessary when you zoom in a little bit I've been doing these with my low temp glue gun in my office this is a high temp I'm sorry both should work this one might just take a little longer because you have to hold it longer because it's hotter it takes longer to cool but it's also stronger so we're gonna see what happens all right I want to make sure that my folded edges are both up or down or you know just keep them consistent and I'm gonna put just a tiny little bit of glue right there it's just the tiniest then I'm gonna stick this on top and pitch it together this is not what the clamp is for but if you want to just clamp it and move on to another one you can okay so I'm switching to green on that one dries so this is what you have I need to do yo y'all gonna have to bail with me while I get into this camera gig y'all this is what you have it's just glued together right there nothing special rounded sides on the top cut sides on the bottom and to start forming this this is how I do it I'm sure there are ways to do it but I was making I was making my bigger ones and I will you sing like a hole glue stick and I was like well that's not gonna work that's uh that's not good so I have some little straight pins right here they're about an inch so if you don't have those you don't need them if you have them try it out and see if you look again I said this is what we're gonna do I'm gonna put a little bit of glue right here a little bit of glue right there take this and fold it over and it's gonna feel a little funky not funky but it's like it doesn't want to go that way and it doesn't so we clamp it and we tell it to go that way and you're gonna get seepage out of here like it's just unavoidable with the low temp glue gun you can go back afterwards and just kind of run your run the tip over there and it kind of melts it so that white disappears but I'm covering with glitter I was arriving my glue gun over the scenes where the glitter was just because it was bothering me it doesn't bother you if you're gonna cover the glitter don't worry about it today we're gonna do the same thing again except this time it's with this one and this is why I wanted the low temp glue gun and I thought it worked would work better because you're going to get glue on your fingers like it's just unavoidable okay we're only using this clamp in the beginning because it's so small I mean you could probably use it with a pair of pliers instead of the clamp but give you life we're gonna clean up the glue that's seeping out as we go I don't really need the clamp anymore all right so to conserve glue and my patience this is how I have it it's starting to form that spiral I'm gonna hold it in between myself in my forefinger like this my forefinger index finger is that called the forefinger or sometimes did I make that up just now yes great let's buy the glue here wrap the black around and under a little tight if you want don't pull it too hard because it will break gotta go here and here you could put it across that whole thing you could turn it and glue everything but again I want to go fast I want to go cheap I want to go easy like me on a date okay so this is gonna end right here so before I do that I'm gonna see where it ends naturally I'm gonna just stick a pin in there now hopefully this is spot where you have in piles a bunch of glue it kind of feels like and what this is gonna do like this side is all glued and now this side has a pin holding all these layers together so it's not going to come undone and when I'm closing these I'll put a little tiny tiny bit of glue and then rub it out with the tip of the glue gun just so there's not too much squeeze out hold that there the exact same thing a little bit of glue wipe it out and hold it down now looks like we can actually clean this one off gonna come in again but will I stay in it wow that looks good this is still cooling a little bit let me show you one that's been cleaned up these are done the exact same way this one has a pin in it you can't see it but it's made with the same foam cut the same way glued the same way but you can see the difference between these two see how this one's kind of shiny that's where I melted the extra glue on top with the tip of the glue gun going in I think if you held us here like it would definitely start to melt but I'm not holding it we're just kind of grazing over it lately no pressure don't touch the trigger okay and now we have one that's kind of shiny but we don't see any of those white blobs and give it a second see with the low melt glue gun I was able to just turn it over squeeze it and it was basically dry immediately now this one I did pretty good on because there's only a little bit there's always gonna be a little bit of glue showing in the middle we see that without me zooming in and out there's a little glue right there goes a little right there we think now I'm just gonna go in it takes like a second cuz that tip is hot yesterday it's all gone there's a little piece right here she's just using this to remelt the glue and clean of any debris all right and here's a paper plate you need this brand I believe that it's great that you make this brand who cares this glitter though I find this is essential this is from Walmart they are 97 cents a tube whenever I see them I buy all of them because this is like the glitter you want to use when you don't want to be garish about something I don't want iridescent I don't want different colors like I don't want to do I don't want to paint on a little thing of glue and then only do this I then only do this I just want clear glitter that sparkles but is not iridescent or holographic anything like that so I have some in this little baggie I'm gonna use that that's right here I'm using Mod Podge on these which serves double purpose it's going to obviously hold in the glitter when we put it all on it and if there's any section of this like see this right here you can't really see that but I can I can move that because there's no glue right there and the pins there's a pin like right here so this little section if you wanted to it could be messed up like that so when you put the Mod Podge on it's gonna go into all these little things and essentially glued the whole thing together like a top coat and I'm gonna have to apply this very technically then I gotta get my good tools over here okay I like doing it with my fingers because I want to get it in all those little grooves you want to use a brush that's up to you I'm just into using my finger wish I had rough table yeah but whatever and now I'm just going to throw some glitter on let's see I cleaned up and I don't have anything to what my hands on cause it's gonna do like that and come back press it in a tiny bit there's a little candy and it looks it looks a little dull right now but that's because there's glue in between the little things I get old clear up it'll be fine [Music] [Music] [Music] of course the glitter is gonna cover a glitter covers all manner of sentence [Music] [Music] like flip it dip it and flick see that one's got a lot of glue one that you can see it looks almost all away but once they're done they will be beautiful and sparkly this is this is one with three colors did I use the same yeah I mustard you just can't go yeah three colors you can do that it's a little harder to start them but that's where you would definitely need to click for so I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope that this video file is not seven hundred gigabytes like the last one was because uh my computer did not like that so there you go thanks for watching if you remember to comment like subscribe share me with your friends ya know it appreciate it and again if you want to get a whole in here stick a lollipop stick wrap it up with some cellophane to make like a you know like a starlight mat deal oh my god that I just knocked that over again with my wild hand gestures okay put the top back on this when you're done alright guys see you later hi", "l4j3Daie3sc": "hey guys it's Claire and it's time for what's in the bag I haven't done these like forever so yeah so see what we have ooh it's but why are they feel it or this purse oh it's multiple things feels like three containers it's like some weird like shopkin gummy egg thing I don't know what to use he's like it sort of feels like it's like one of those kinder eggs like the kinder eggs are like you sort of like half the toys and stuff there's English shopkins oh no I don't like these so basically though I got a lollipop with chili powder okay let's go ahead and choose a thumbnail photo boil so let's go ahead to negative no more tears so I sort of only tried one like this before I've only tried the right one for so I'm like super excited to try these again guys I don't only like the chili powder this with them but I'm gonna really pop out of it so so let's go ahead and try so I'm gonna go ahead and try the red one I sort of already opened it sorry okay then perhaps just like your like you container you can like make around and pops of popsicles with if you have to work for just cool he's like once you eat so what's cool is a half a little like you know like ring pops had that little prong thing so wait I almost you know like ring box have a little prompt wrong theme like you that's inside the law to a lollipop this has that too so you can make like you may like popsicles with this too and I just realize that it's like right now I just realize that we could use those air bubbles which is cool so I might make a popsicle who knows can I have my laptop back woo okay let's try it [Music] tastes better than I remembered it's worth to take a talky just the powder not the actual thing how am I supposed to get how am I said how am I supposed to get to the actual lookout though I can't beat the lollipop yeah I don't like that so the chili pot is pretty good all right that 9 out of 10 but the cherry chili thing no and only know I'm supposed to put that back on so I go ahead and wait I didn't break the lollipop though altogether it's like a 3 so I might just wash off the jelly gotta or so many of that dust it off and like Etha like hop separate pieces lollipop so my kid i got like coat this powder on my chips or something made like tacky this one's sort of exploded mother I don't know if it's good it's sort of rooted [Music] that's big so I could try to like rip off a little bit so I can't really taste it the chilli powder is just a taking over okay yeah it's not gonna work so the most likely it's all gonna stay the same so I can't get the toy power off it's like sticky how do we know this is a taste this [Music] no it's okay so what labor is that what's simile now let's try the orange one so the Sham boy whatever squad end up being pickled fruit what is the right pickle food that just sounds strange and then sound like a good lollipop flavor so let's see if this line is any good this was mango I do like me go so seems promising scares me every single time it's like a jacket box do you want to show like - it's the same thing help it's like a rain pop I got stuck on my finger [Music] [Music] so the honestly it all tastes the same so it's gonna be the same reading just the same same rating so I think overall the chilli powder is a seven the lollipops are like so the cherry wine I couldn't taste it so my rated one for the camel layer would not it tastes the nasty some operating zero this slider taste a lot but also a red one so seven one seven powder 1 1 and 0 that was the overall ratings like thieves and I want to stay on so I not really like it I'm sorry if you like it and I don't because I just don't really like it I don't know why it's probably like because I'm not a big fan of spicy things we eat a lot of spicy things at once and just a spicy lollipop tastes strange so yeah so like it's time for candy fun goodbye", "X51qBFrtlJc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

toffee and butter crunch only instead of regular white sugar it is always made of brown sugar with the addition of butter glucose syrup vanilla and other flavorings that's all good and well some will say but what the fudge is toffee not to mention butter crunch well if you are a newcomer to the sweetness universe have no fear I've got you covered just check my posts and videos on these subjects the links are down below and you will get the hang of it in no time for now I'll just say that Tuffy's made the white sugar and butter butter crunch is made of white sugar butter chocolate and nuts and the butterscotch is made of brown sugar and butter now a few words about the origin of the name butterscotch the food historians agree that the world doesn't have anything to do with Scotland because the word Scotch means to cut or to score yes butterscotch has to be handled cut into pieces butterscotch is a term also used to describe brown sugar and butter flavor without referring to the candy so there is butterscotch sauce butterscotch pudding or butterscotch pie naturally for us sweetness lovers the only butterscotch is the sugary one so let's make some therefore have all your ingredients measured and your digital candy thermometer on hand and I'll teach you how to make butterscotch lollipops as usual the recipes on my site and the link is down below I've placed my lollipop mold on a tray and now I'll insert a lollipop stick into the each circle of the silicone mold next I'm gonna put melted butter light brown sugar dark Muscovado sugar water and salt into a saucepan and stir to combine I will put the lid on and bring the mixture to a boil when the mixture boils I will remove the lid and add glucose syrup I'll insert the probe of my digital candy thermometer into the mixture and continue cooking until it reaches 145 degrees centigrade which is 293 degrees Fahrenheit then I will remove the thermometer add vanilla powder to the mixture and remove it from the heat I will wait for a couple of moments until the mixture stops boiling then I will carefully pour the mixture into the prepared lollipop molds using the spoon and leave my lollipops to cool down [Music] my lollipops are done and now I'll take them out from the mold and treat myself to this sugary delight yummy delicious and yummy so good to eat I wanna let you feel your sweetness on my lips you will

forget to create sweetness every day because sweetness is happiness see you in the next video bye [Music]", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions

the garden but today I wanted to do something different I'd like to try to make some bourbon flavored and another batch with absent won't follow me in the kitchen and see how these turn out all right I'm back in the kitchen now I'm gonna do the Bourbon first and I'll put all the ingredients and measurements down in the show notes below I'm gonna start off with a quarter cup of bourbon here punch get that on the leg then I'm gonna add 3/4 cup sugar and 1/8 teaspoon salt I don't have a heat all right the second I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on but I got it put in three tablespoons of corn sugar all right that's in there and then two tablespoons of water so you can get the jar open or the bottle open there's one and there's two get that out of the way now let me go ahead and turn this guy on it's a little noisy but I set it for right what is it for 25 see if that'll do it we want to keep stirring this until against to 300 degrees when this thing gets to 300 degrees I'm going to go ahead and shut it off and then add one more teaspoon of bourbon and then pouring in our sucker molds so we'll just let that sit so it comes the tongue and I'll be checking the temperature with one of these the thermal meters then infrared thermal meters they look pretty good we can actually shoot it in then out and it's 99 we're locked on 99 degrees [Music] okay we're about 240 but another sixty degrees that go and I have some food coloring that I was gonna put in here but I'm only gonna do it to the absent just maybe one or two drops so for a lesson Green nothing for the burger looks like there's a nice brown haze hood anyway we're past that 3-headed marking go ahead and shut it off not only about 1 teaspoon of bourbon there we go and do that just that an easy stir there okay we're ready to pour our mixture in the a molds all right let's see if we can't do this without messing up it's a little foamy [Music] a little bit more [Music] I didn't add in the food coloring like I said so they got a natural amber color which is perfect and I'll have to wait till these cool all the way since I don't have enough molds to do the absent flavor now absent I think it's going to be really good it should be able to get that nice licorice taste along with extra sugar huh all that foam went away not getting a lot of bubbles so when I tried the absent I'm gonna let it cool for a couple minutes maybe that was my problem in the beginning it was too hot all right this is gonna be it [Music] okay we made 24 suckers with that recipe there all right I'm gonna do some accent suckers now so just like before the store quarter cup of absent the pre-op Davis was a Pharaoh corn syrup all right let's start his night and last time when I did the burden I was stirring it the whole time I reread the directions on the Loran oils you know like peppermint cinnamon they used in regular candy I reread the directions and they said don't stir it I just let it come to a boil at 300 degrees or until it reaches beyond their degrees so I screwed up the first time so now I'm just going to stir it until the sugars melted and then leave all alone and this time I am going to use the food coloring I'm going to put a couple drops of neon green in there this induction cooktop here is pretty good it gets the temperature pretty quick okay looks like all the sugars are melted so I'm just going to leave it alone so it gets the 300 and now it's 170 508 if about 260 and I know if we're just doing the regular suckers with that no alcohol soon as he gets around 260 and jumps right up to 300 pretty quick okay we're getting close we're up to 90 the whole spots in there 300 okay go ahead and kill the heat for another 1 teaspoon of absent the cheese spoon and then okay and here's our food coloring I just put two drops in there that's it make sure this rule we put a total of five drops in by having three drops just in all right these guys in the mold now there's that foam again now I make a little mess a little bit [Music] [Music] I don't think I'm going to make as many as I did last time last time the Bourbon we've got 24 suckers looks like we're gonna get 24 all right we're done I tasted both of them had a lot of defects so I had to eat all the defects the Bourbon I definitely would not do again you can't really taste any of the Bourbon so that was just that that wasn't a big waste there's only a quarter cup but I would not do it again and absent definitely gonna do it again it doesn't have a real strong licorice taste but there just a subtle but it's really good so definitely gonna do the absent again but not with any type of bourbon and remember on that bourbon I was stirring it the whole time don't do that I can see a little bit of bubbles in the Bourbon once and I think that's what was caused by me stirring it or constantly stirring it with absent I didn't like the directions said stir it until the sugar dissolves and then leave it alone until it boils and then just keep an eye on it to against the 300 and pull it add your food coloring and one other teaspoon of absent or whatever you're doing you know if you're doing brandy bourbon the absent cherry yeah a cure whatever it is at the very end take it off the heat and if you're going to add some color go ahead and do that and add one other teaspoon of that liquor to it all right hope you enjoyed it and if you like this

lolli *pops cheek* looks like a plant. smells like cheese. blue cheese? what colour's my tongue? it tastes like foot. blue cheese isn't sugary, so that's where it trolls ya. it looks like blue cheese as well. oh my god, this is disgusting! i'm really enjoying this. it smells so much more horrible than it is. i mean i've had worse lollipops. yeah. like, when you've found them on the ground. you can get the smell off of it but you can't taste it. it's not that bad. ugh, uh i just, once you to tell me about the smell, i can't go anywhere near it i feel like it's leaving that cheesy residue in my mouth though. it would kind of trick you into thinking it's slightly healthier than your regular lollipop. you got lipstick all over yours. it's a sign the lollipop's had a good time it smells like a pencil parer (?) this one looks like it might be spicy. oh, strong flavor. (various sounds of disgust) no! there's definitely two flavours going on here. there's the yellow flavour and the pink flavour. it's pizza?! that's pizza? this is pizza? this is rank. (?) in no way does that taste like pizza. the pink flavour tastes a little like done off perfume. (talking to the lollipops) you are not pizza, no, you are a lollipop of lies and the yellow flavour tastes a bit like feet. it's like licking done off perfume off of somebody's feet! where is the bread? where is the tomato? where is the meat? where's the.. nice? this one is so much worse than the blue cheese one. i would demand my money back, if i bought this lollipop. not getting a pizza smell, not getting a pizza taste. zero outta ten. do you know what it actually tastes like? what? you know that smell you get when you're near a bin. imagine pizza came in that form though. that was your whole pizza. that'd suck, wouldn't it? that'd be terrible. literally! this looks like wee. it's earwax. just smells like a normal sweet lolli, doesn't it? that's actually quite nice. it doesn't smell like wee. oh wait, there's something spicy. pepper? little prickles of fire, on my tongue. i don't like the feeling, that hurts me. kind of refreshing, like, that'd be the thing you'd eat if you had a stuffed nose, or something. yeah, it's just kind of boring. yeah! it's not tequila, is it? the sweetness definitely overrides the tequila-ness. habanero, that's where the spice is coming from. wh-- i would stay going with that, now. (?) really?! if there was no other sweets in the house. out of all three of them, this one i could actually eat. i wonder if there's more tequila if you bite into it. do it. oh! wouldn't it be great if there was a worm inside of it? i'm going to go out on a limb, and say it's cocaine. i don't trust it. smells familiar, though, as well. i know what it is. i just can't put the nipple on it! oh my, it does not taste nice. it's gone off milk. (?) buttermilk, cow's milk. it's sour milk. almond, or... goat's milk soy? breast milk! :D oh my god! **** off. that's disgusting! i'm really glad i didn't like it now because that would've been Weird. this is good! (?) i like this. i was like, \"it tastes familiar\" no! are they treated well? is this free-range breast milk? it's not that bad like it smells horrible but it didn't last that bad. you know what'd be great with this? a cup o' tea. (of course) this gets like, a minus five outta ten. this is not nice. best so far! yeah, definitely, one-hundred percent. *croaks* no. *croaks/hiccups/burps again* (inaudible) like to ween children off... the tiddies? it looks kind of fleshy. not that i don't like that... (?) oh, it's a spice! it's a, it's another, boxes you in the face job. hooo... that's disgusting. wasabi? yeeeeeah yeah i can get it now. it's very mild. ...hate, wasabi, why is it in everything? *more sounds of disgust* see i like it. no! ugh it's so disgusting why? ginger! i hate ginger! oh, the ginger's really strong now that i know what it is. why would you put ginger with wasabi? why would you put wasabi with any-- oh i don't care anymore i like this. no! *groaning* i hate it! it's nice though! ginger is the worst. it's supposed to help your stomach but it makes me wanna throw up, so, that's ironic. so i still prefer the breast milk, but this comes a close second. daaah, i don't know why i keep eating it because i keep getting so disgusted by it just like holy... *slurring words* all in the name of science, i suppose. some scientists are going to space. others are making disgusting lollipops. you know what, there's something very sexy about a girl with a lollipop. you know, standin' there, twirlin' it. when she's over eighteen of course!", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "xUpGTvPrCG8": "welcome back to unwrapped I'm Marc summers exploring the candy we like to lick that would be the lollipop the original lollipop machines were invented in the early 1900s and their output was 40 lollipops in one minute today's machines make almost 6,000 lollipops a minute and one of the biggest lollipop producers is the Spangler candy company the 1920s were all about great invention cars radios television and the birth of the dum-dum lollipop the best thing since sliced bread which was also invented in the 20s people have a wonderful nostalgic feel about dumbness the Spangler Candy Company bought the dum dum brand in 1953 today the fourth generation of Spanglish produces 8 million puffs per day the original sales manager of the Akron Candy Company which developed the dum dum pop thought that Dum Dums was a name that children young children could both say and remember weighing in at only a quarter of an ounce this tiny pop packs a punch after more than 80 years it's the second most popular lollipop in America at the Spangler candy company in Bryan Ohio it all starts with equal amounts of corn syrup and sugar get in a copper kettle in about a year's time for dumpling pops we used about 20 million pounds of sugar and about 20 million pounds after comes out of the copper kettle we add flavoring and coloring and mix it up citric acid from sugar and malic acid from Apple's add sweetness or tartness two different flavors there are ten core flavors in each bag but new flavors are added and old flavors returned every few years so a root beer dumb-dumb might be replaced by pink lemonade butterscotch or a primary mixer needs the candy for five minutes in order to blend the flavor and color throughout each batch then an elevator carries the candy up to a press to flatten it out roll it into a cylindrical shape and then insert the sticks the Pops hit this order where they get ready for dum-dum signature sashay wrapper it's got a little flat four fold on it and one of the nice things about it is it makes it easy to rap there were seven original flavors lemon lime orange coconut pineapple cherry grape and butterscotch but today flavor specialists create new pops based on their list of four hundred potential flavors this is spicy citrus and then we have a dragon fruit and here's a cinnamon bun but how about that mystery flavor that comes in every bag of Dum Dums do you think you know what it is what is this flavor what is a mystery flavor a lot of people say I love your mystery flavors the truth is the mystery flavor is different from batch to batch so they don't have to stop production in between flavors all of our dum-dum lines are continuous and a one batch of grape is followed by a batch of sua say strawberry so there's gonna be a portion of the candy that's gonna be a mixture of strawberry of grape or both mystery solved you never know what flavor combination you're going to unwrap producing two billion dum-dums a year the Spangler lab continues to explore a growing flavor frontier this one is a noir chata flavor it's a Hispanic flavor that's real popular it's a cinnamon creamy type flavor but one flavor in particular generates both complaints and compliment buttered popcorn which is one of the most controversial flavors we've ever had it was hugely popular and hugely unpopular that chocolate dum-dum didn't get a lot of praise either sort of have those flavors that you like or maybe your favorite flavor and it's like going on a little treasure hunt every time you open a bag you know it's just a little sweet moment in the day in a world that's you know not always so sweet", "nu6k-L4uPA8": "what's up you guys it's Alfonso and today I'm going to be trying out some Mexican candy I've seen a lot of Americans trial Mexican candy and when I was watching it my mouth was watering because I wanted to be having that candy right now but they weren't enjoying it at all so I thought why not let a Mexican show you how to properly enjoy Mexican candy and then would also fear that nobody knows what a tamarind is so I took the liberty of buying a tamarind from you know the local Hispanic market and here it is it's just a fruit that hangs from a tree and you know you just crack the shell there you go and that little you know poppy seed thing sort of like the green beans you know and you just know there's in every little bump there's a seed and it's not even spicy it's sweet and sour and it's just really good so even sour tamarind that's here you'll have a better look there you go you can see it you see it there you go we're gonna start out with the infamous bell on I've heard many of you call this hot poop and let me tell you it does not taste like and see how easy it came up people who are literally fighting with the container if you don't know Spanish you don't know that bolon means bald means a bald person in order to get the candy which is a soft tamarind candy you have to press the green part of the candy down so that the hair grows out and are well that's a short haircut but I mean you just you just lick it off you just eat it and it tastes great I don't understand why Americans or the videos I've seen at least I don't understand what how how can you not enjoy this I I would finished it you know another thing that we do I'm sorry about this laughing is that when you're running out or you know you're close to running out of the soft candy you will just pull these apart there you go and you just lick the rest off of the white part it's delicious I can't stop eating it but we have next is something you might know pretty well which is the Lucas gusano gusano means warm you know because it kind of looks like a warm if you put it sideways sword um and you have to squeeze it you know kind of like an accordion so you just twist this off and you pull it out like seriously I've seen so many videos with the Americans trying to open this and it's just so difficult for them let's get into it because whenever they try this they gag so you just squirt it into your mouth [Music] oh my god that is so good it is so good I can't stop oh my god my mouth just keeps watering it wants more how can you not like this next stop is a lollipop you know mangoes lollipops mango flavor um covered in chili you know as we do you know this one they went for it cuz even the stick is covered in chili and see the thing is that whenever I see somebody trying out Mexican candy they just do this no no I can't that's not how you're supposed to enjoy this please note that once you lick the chili off you'll get the sweet of mango flavored hard candy that's you know in there and you will have the spiciness from the chili powder mixed with the sweetness of these my mouth is water you'll have the sweetness of these my mouth can't stop watering you have the sweetness of the mango flavored hard candy mix with the spiciness of the chili powder that was around it and it is just good I mean some people just go straight for it [Music] mmm see you like yellow nice design that is so sweet mix with the chili powder from outside you know I just wanna keep eating all these I don't want to put them away it's not spicy it's just really good mixed up is another lollipop as you can see and this one is shaped like a corn and it's also covered in chili and it's the same principle as the other one the spiciness of the chili powder surrounds the sweetness of the mango flavored hard candy inside let's see if I can bite it without breaking my teeth Oh Celie illness inside that is so sweet again mixed with the spiciness it's just good next up is these gummies tamarind flavor as we do covered in chili powder also as we do and we're gonna get one by the way these won't last like two weeks I promise so you open it up somebody said that it smells like blood and from fact the reason why it smelled like blood is because mmm spicy Mexican candy has a lot of iron in it and so does your blood but it's not really the blood you're smelling it's the iron in the candy so we're gonna try it out [Music] hmm so good with feistiness surrounding the hing the gummy if you bite it it mixes with the sweetness from the inner gummy this is good if people were throwing up at this point it's just good candy it's sweet candy float sugar that is surrounded with spicy chilli and it's a perfect combination next up is the Lucas Micah's and if you didn't know my gosh means you know faces like the faces that you do when you eat something sour like me and you know you just twist it pull there you go got the sweet candy covered in chili powder again same principle and get to the sweetness mix this with the spiciness and you have some chili powder here as well and you just you know you get in there you know what do you do what you do but you I film this whole video finishing this this this ring pop that spicy it's sweet and that's Mexican candy now we have the broken letter bola which just means a broken little paw and it is just chewing gum with the chili on it mean and if you don't want to do this one dig into the drawer Goleta bola honesty you know because they come with a stick to and I think this one is a little different because there's like different hard candy layers on the top you know with chili of course and you have to get to the center where there is a little strawberry flavored gum inside I'm gonna try this in person you know that's good I used to eat these a lot and all okay we just keep licking until you get through all the layers and then you just chew the caramel that's inside let me see if I can buy it and let's show you the different layers [Music] there you can see those layers it's red green yellow orange and the the gum inside so now we're going to try the regatta ball you know without mystique I haven't actually had these before because I think they're mu I don't think they were around when I was a little kid but I'm licking it and I can't find a flavor like there's not spotted food it's leaving my tongue really red but oh yeah it's just like the rogue a little mistake you know different layers desired I'm guessing I come in the center so now we're going over to the Lukas Baba song and you know it's called a bomba so because boom bah so means a big bomb lemon flavor hot candy with chewing gum and it's called a bomba so because I don't know if you can tell but it sort of looks like you know like a missile you just push it there you go so as you can see there's you know spicy candy inside with a gum and there's this little scoop attached to the lid and you just you know you just scoop the spice cami out what you can do also is that you scoop out the gum there you go wait there you go you scoop out the gum you chew it Oh hard we chew it and the sweet is from the gum just really complements the spiciness from the tart Andy oh good you know what I should do a video of me trying out American Cathy see how that goes anyways I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you are a little more enlightened about Mexican candy it is not just spicy but if you want spicy you know go ahead if you down then there's a plane there's plenty of other types of candy that you know you can buy and they're pretty good personally I enjoy the spiciness and the sweetness that mix together and just create heaven my mouth is watering and just thinking about it that's all for today I hope you enjoyed

I've never had it before and I'm on a total learning curve I don't speak Spanish I don't read Spanish so a lot of times I make mistakes on the pronunciations and people nicely correct me original v.i.c that dull chest that Oh a little Otis helo tests a low test I don't know but it looks like corn on the cob almost but you can kind of make out the word strawberry flavored so interesting look to it for being strawberry flavored and look at that let's get this open so take a look at that now those of you out there that like this kind of Canyon had before then you know leave some comments there help me out be nice I'm gonna try it for the first time and then I have a rag here off to the side I'll wipe off my spittle who wants to see someone spin all right now I didn't fight it yet but there is this coating of that flavoring I don't get any kind of strawberry flavoring so maybe I've got to dig deeper I don't know so I guess I have to bite this hold on okay now inside I don't can't see it strawberry for some reason it's got a little bite to it you do get that sugar any kind of strawberry taste but it's not like you're eating a strawberry you know what I mean I don't know about this one it's good but you probably got to spend more time just enjoying it and not fighting it like I did but if you had it before then tell me hey this is your favorite or not if you've never seen it that's cool and you learn something new and thanks for watching it's really appreciated later this video is now over if you want to see more Mexican candy check the description search a channel or just click

citric acid one liquid form and one powder form I also am going to use two different types of molds I got these molds for Christmas this mold here is meant probably for chocolate but it worked for lollipops but the best way to make lollipops obviously is by using a lollipop mold that has a place for a stick so let's get started alright start with two cups of sugar 3/4 cup corn syrup 3/4 cup of water turn your heat on to a medium heat and stir this up until the sugar dissolves try to keep the sugar from collecting around the side wipe the sides down with the wet paper towel to keep it on sugar now let that boil until it reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit let a boil in the pot for about 20 minutes add about 10 drops of food coloring of your choice stir that in we want the water to evaporate now add the flavoring I'm using apple flavor one dram of apple flavor by Lorraine's oils and add a bout a tablespoon of this at a tablespoon of tart and sour I'm just gonna guess and you can purchase these at a cooking shop or probably on Amazon I don't know if that's going to make it sour enough so I did add some citric acid I've seen them do it on lofty pursuits so I'm gonna try it out but see it's not going to boil out so it won't burn I put lollipop sticks in these molds and these do not require in volley pop sticks so we're gonna see how that works pour them into your mold and take the stick and just twist it a little bit there you go all right the pot would be a mess so all you need to do is fill it with water and the water will break it down and clean it up all right it is possible to use these molds the only problem is you have to keep standing them up until the syrup is hard and there you have it some sour apple lollipops thank you thanks for watching",

shape we have the color and then we stir carefully to boil all the water out we don't want any water left because this will make the candy stick while it may look like we're adding more sugar here or not we're adding citric acid most fruits have an acidic content to them and our flavoring doesn't so we need to add it back in the citric acid may only be added after a certain point where the candy will be too hot and the acid will burn leaving a lousy taste in the tasters mouth the candy that was against the table and the bars is now cooled down a lot but the bits of the center is still scalding hot wave to mix the candy together to make it get to an even temperature so we can work with it as the candy changes states it goes from liquid to semi solid to more solid and eventually it gets solid enough that we can put it over a hook and fold it again and again until it becomes white the sugar starts as a deep amber but as we fold it over and over we trap millions of air bubbles and it makes the candy become a brilliant white each one of those little air bubbles acting is a mirror to reflect the light it's time to assemble the candy and we're going to move the candy to a temperature controlled surface that will slow down the cooling of the candy to give us time to do our assembly we're making red and white stripes the white stripes are there to reflect the light through the red stripes to make it look more jewel like if you want to order our candy you can try it for yourself and get it at our website WWE Network now that we have a big log of candy we need to get it down to the size of a rope so we can spiral our lollipops we do this by pinching off one end pulling out a log slowly and then pulling out rod by rod until they all are right to turn into lollipops we twist the rope making the pattern go around it and then we take the rope and we make it into a spiral the heart-shaped lollypop starts as a traditional circular lollipop then the lollipop gets passed on to the second candy maker the second candy maker takes the candy and puts it into a steel form which they press it into the shape of the heart they then take a wooden stick and insert it into the candy making it into a lollipop if you ever make it to Tallahassee to see us make our candies live here at lofty pursuits you can also go to our website wpri.com", "MuxjpnmqeI4": "it's time for your your bank's 12 hi everyone today I'm going to show you I'm going to call it a demonstration rather than a tutorial because you need these particular molds to be able to do this and I know that some of you may not be able to find them these are for Halloween they are witches fingers and there's some eyeballs and what you do is you fill up the little molds with the candy melting wafers and then you can put a sucker stick here and then you have little suckers when you're done so I'm going to show you how to make these and what I would suggest is you take a look at your local craft stores if you have a bulk barn which is a bulk food store in Ontario then you may be able to find them there these are the sucker sticks they come in I think there is a hundred in here and they're from the bulk barn and these cost two dollars and forty nine cents which is fairly reasonable so there are the sucker sticks okay we're gonna do the eyeball first we need white red much Brown and I'm going to make blue eyes so we need blue these are candy melting wafers they taste a little like white chocolate is what they taste like and they're especially designed to be melted and when they harden in a mold they're nice and shiny I bought these at the bulk barn however I know you can buy them online under the brand name merkins or in Wilton or Wilton and you can also get them at craft stores so I bought these at the bulk barn and I store them at room temperature in these little plastic containers now you can melt these in a ziploc bag but if you have some concerns about Ziploc bags and the fact that they may release chemicals into the candy and don't use them um I'm going to be making a couple here to show you so I'm gonna put some candy melting wafers in a glass microwave of a bowl and we're going to microwave and I'll show you how to do that so I'm going to put the candy melting wafers in here now the secret to melting these is to melt them at 50% power or if you don't have that on your microwave melt them on defrost mode so I'm just going to show you my microwave here I've got power level and I'm going to go to power level 5 which is 50% and we're going to start off with 30 seconds and we're going to do start and after 30 seconds we'll take a look if they started to meld we'll give them a stir if not we're going to do another 30 seconds this is after 3 30-second intervals you can see they're starting to melt a little so what I'm going to do is just take a spoon and just give them a stir because once they start to melt it doesn't take long give them a little stir just like that that's enough I'm going to put back in for another 30 seconds ok and we're good and once they're melted as you're working with them if they start to harden up not going to take long to get them melted again they seem to retain heat for quite a long time this is actually perfect consistency for dipping or for whatever you want to do sometimes they get too sometimes they're too thick if they're too thick and you need to add a little bit of vegetable shortening to it stir it around and it will thin it out and still be perfect for candy making so there we go they're melted in this bowl but I like to use them in ziplock bag I find it's just easier so I'm going to transfer the melted white into a ziplock bag and then just hold onto this bowl with a spoon and use it again next time you have to melt some if you have a whole bunch do go first thing we do start off with the very center of the eye which is going to be just a little bit of chocolate we'll just let it drip and then we'll just tap the mold a little bit and let it spread out and do the same thing with the other one okay now for the color part of the I'm going to do that in blue now I could let this brown harden first but I'm not going to because I'm just going to be careful like so and I know it doesn't look smooth but all you have to do is give it a tap and it's just smoothing out now what I've done is I put some red in a ziplock bag and to get the veins this is going to be hard to see but to get the veins I'm just going to fill up the little veins with the red like so and I'm going to go put this in the refrigerator not for long I'd say for 5-10 minutes to let it harden before we go on to the next step but before I do that actually I'm going to do a witch's finger might as well do a witch's finger I think we'll do a finger nail and read so hope you can fill it the nail bed now we're going to fill this with green and what it's just about full we're going to add a sucker stick we want to make sure it's further enough into the candy melting wafer so I give it a little turn to coat it and then put it in just like that and if you think it needs a little bit more to hold it in there we'll add it and then just a little tap you'll smooth out and you're going to put the refrigerator to harden so now that the center of the eye and the little veins are set we're going to add the white to fill it up so it's almost full and then we're going to add a sucker stick and I usually give them a little turn just to coat and you want to make sure there's enough of it to hold the sucker in place and then I add a little bit more it will even up and all the bubbles will come to the surface as well that's another reason why I'm going to tap it some light Tufts bubbles will come to the surface and then refrigerate again so once there's the really chilled you're just going to pop them on the mold and if they're cool enough they should come out quite nicely and they should be nice and shiny there's the eyeball eyeball and another witch's finger now to serve them you just put them a container and hand them out or you get these little treat bags they also sell these at the fall form and you put your little treat inside like so and then you can put a twist tie around here if you want or a piece of ribbon I mean I don't have any orange or black ribbon which would probably be best for this because during it's Halloween but just so that you get the idea tie it with a piece of ribbon and you can curl up the edges if you'd like and there is one little Halloween tree for somebody next one I make though I will let the chocolate ice enter Harden before I put the blue you can see how it they've kind of bled into one another the colors so I think I would let the chocolate harden before I put the blue that's the only thing different I would make I would do with these same thing with this one that the blue what you wouldn't see the blue going into the mid Center like that if I would have let the brown chocolate harden first but they're still cute and I'm still just as edible so here's one where I let the brown part of the eye harden before putting the blue and you can see how it's a lot nicer a lot nicer and there's no bleeding into the brown into the blue you", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "Syvb_msai9A": "all right it's time to cut this thing open and see what color it is wait we know it's a pink one i don't we don't know i think it's because it's a moon and stars cross it's a hybrid between the moon stars and i think a yellow watermelon so moment of truth i thumped it this thing sounds full of water very nice is it red oh it crossed with that a hybrid melon that the other one crossed with yeah look at that seed color looks good mmm smells good all right taste test real quick i should have held one to end up here i'll hold these two up all right maybe you can see this better it's super drippy dude all right so cut this open rebecca you want to try something he's doing his homework i said oh okay all right oh it smells good mmm is it just as good as the other one yes i feel like i'm gonna say that on every time or every i know you gotta have one bad water this is the sweetest one i've ever had [Music] try that we're pretty successful at growing good watermelons though getting sweet watermelons thumbs up or down whatever too sweet that's why you get watermelons what do you think blake it's pretty good pretty good is it too sweet yeah yeah what's up too sweet tastes good it's like a raw watermelon oh wow well you're no help get out get out of here i love it what about me can i try it by it yeah take it over while it's chill because it's warm that's what it is it's warm we'll put these in the refrigerator and eat them in a minute what do you think we'll cool them off actually this is less sweeter than the other one but still really sweet yeah i like that one better than the other one because i thought the other one was too sweet this one i think this one's at a good uh mature or ripeness the other one's a little too soon i think this one's like perfect yeah the other one was really sugary like it literally tasted like someone poured a bunch of sugar on it this one's like a perfect sweetness i think i think i like to texture this one better like the other the other watermelon that we opened in a previous vlog that one we're thinking about making sweetener out of it because that's how sweet it was i dehydrated some of it and it was like pure sugar yeah i'm gonna dehydrate a piece of this and see what it's like are you gonna open this one too um because i'm gonna can it yeah let's open it all right we got one more to open let's see we got a ton out there right now so yeah i hope this one's a yellow one all right drum roll watch your fingers oh yeah here's the dehydrated watermelon it's super duper sweet like cotton candy cotton candy it is exactly like cotton candy like when you smash the cotton candy down all right drum roll what color is it i have this yellow yay boy we love the yellow watermelons let's do a taste test between the two now all right that's good all right he went straight for the fork all right well that was less less sweet less sweet yellow watermelons are our favorite they're the best hands down all right give this to mom i think let's see yeah not just a better flavor all the way around that's cool i don't know what it is give me a red one blake i gotta taste test them together and this one has black suits yeah this one's easier let's taste these two together red good this one feels sweet but doesn't have that super kick of sugar like that one does and once left the yellow one has a cleaner flavor like this one the red one almost you could taste almost like a fermented fruit flavor in it but the yellow one's cleaner like i can't explain it oh really see i thought the yellow was a tv this one tastes more like uh melon almost but like real clean i like this one the best almost like a slicing cucumber would taste but super sweet i still the yellow is still my favorite [Music] well those are our taste test for the watermelons and i made a mess someone turn the camera off so i can go crazy i know that's what you're trying to do okay super pretty hold that there you go [Music] got it do it again blake and it's so scary now do me now you", "uXiPssq5EGk": "that we're what often they're grown is Georgia I don't know I don't know where they grow watermelon but today where are watermelons grown I'm ruined your intro today we are taste testing watermelon that we picked up at the grocery store to figure out what is the best tasting watermelon and then we're gonna make a video on how to pick the perfect watermelon I'm very curious to see how the American watermelons taste and when I was in Europe it was just the juiciest and it was so sweet good would you say this is like 20 pounds yeah watermelon is supposed to be heavier than it looks normally I think it has to do you have to do some like knocking oh my it sounds different than yours listen do I have to cut one is there right when it comes oh there's always a cut away producer man help [Music] I can tell it might be a little soft I mean I got Crunchwrap the bad stuff Oh oh I like this one there's no sweetness it's not very sweet it's it's more sour that is true this may be my favorite one yet this is going straight straight to the top of the class for you kid it was good taste good texture the brine seems appropriate size not too big texture is their flavor mm-hmm I would have preferred if my producer would have chilled it a bit more cuz I like my watermelon colas but yeah [Music] this is what your watermelons supposed to look like folks this one and it's it's more pink I would say yeah it's actually a very pink looks this one just lungs mealy Wow yeah this one has a lot more pink miss you I don't like that at all this one's a little bit more sour yeah looks like that done maybe a little under right I don't know this make sense but it is more hydrated like it's sure there's more water content I agree this one tastes sour he doesn't have a watermelon TASIS and it's not as crisp as the first one was I feel like this one is gonna be one of the worst I really like that one I'm already this one looks not good look at the rind on this one holy moly that is so much rind don't eat it oh we're not gonna know I don't eat this it looks like kind of woman I don't know if they're gonna keep this in the video but this if a Waterman had gonorrhea I imagine this is what it would look like as I'm about to take a bite don't eat that mmm is that just is that bad or is it like not ripe at all I don't know but it looks disgusting yeah I have that's going at the end it it's very gummy here zoom it punch in it's kind of tastes like a honeydew a little bit oh it's real crunchy so that makes me think that it's like not even close to right that's like kind of jelly mm-hmm yeah it's not good No oh this one has a pretty green ruff I think it's very short run to compared to oh you know we haven't been looking at Ryan I'm actually I'm actually learning about water right now and watermelon is one of the foods to have the highest content water yeah they're actually carrots and cucumber have more in fact isn't my worst one this weakness is good but I cannot do the texture I don't even know if I can eat anymore mushy not sweet what no my bees it was really good it has more of a sugary flavor but it's almost like it's like a day too long like it's not bad but it feels like tomorrow it might be bad tastes like mashed potato watermelon my first bite was a little crispy or my second buy it was like where the mush was yeah I'm not going straight down just think of like a watermelon slush that's what it tastes like you know it's too like mushy I like it I like a firm watermelon [Music] so we have confirm that the shorter the rhymes we're not yeah yeah the shorter the rhymes the better the watermelon this one looks mushy I can tell like a death wish me it's almost like everyone oh no it's me Lee things are really good this one is dark and mysterious yes this one has a has a troubled past Taylor there's terrible but I only like the texture I don't like the most she like oh you're smashing buns now like when you have like watermelon candies it's the flavor I get a lot of that flavor from this not so much of the sweetness but that what you associate with watermelon paper this one has a lot of that flavor wait so are we wrong we're wrong about our Ryan theory so maybe the theory is no one actually knows [Music] this one just looks like it was cut it's a nice firm stiff watermelon I don't know this looks pretty nothing this one's too juicy well let's taste really good and this look at this deep red color this one for some reason so look the seat on this one you see those red has juicier but there's no flavor mm-hmm sweet but like I'm not getting any of it there's no this is delicious now texture wise this one has a little bit of that like kind of mealiness I like that you like them you like the firm I like the firmer watermelon no it's complete mush this one had a lot of flavor right off the bat but the closer I get to the rind I lose a lot of the flavor and no out of the sweetness for me this is really juice water sweet not good sweet not crisp refreshing sweet I don't even get a sweetness I wouldn't even put this below this hour because it's like nothing these two the winner bright lots of flavor but a lot of sweetness this one is just so rich I'm gonna put that I enjoyed this one more which makes me think maybe I like a lighter more so everything right something like that yeah that one just had so much more flavor and sweetness and crispness mmm and that was actually pretty easy it's kind of crazy like how differently shaped tasted that was the best on I wonder if it was as soon as everyone else's I'm questioning that one I don't like that much milk a lot of flavor and some sweetness great texture yes ii know it kind of changes from size to sizes through this section of the watermelon that you got probably like it varies you know these ones I'm afraid locked those I'm pretty sure of an anime sour and this was just merely yeah so we swap pouring and wash so it goes 5 1 4 I actually like this one too hmm still love it but super sweet sugary but the middle of these three I would eat them like I would eat them I would be happy it would be fine see just one there's one still taste doesn't don't taste ripe enough to me it's got that greenness that maybe you like like you'd like it a little less ripe but this one is just so just like perfect I just I can't I'm gonna judge can't accept this in the second place cuz I believe in it being first so much so our favorite was number one showcase number one our second was number five five number six number five number one one this time was just a perfect combination of sweet and juicy and crisp yes which is I think watermelone this also goes to show you when you're at the grocery store just because it's all at the same grocery store came from the same place there can be totally different flavors of watermelon which is why it's really important to know how to pick the best one you really want to not just randomly pick a watermelon I think you want to give some in thought and in tension between what watermelon you're picking out versus just singling this one looks good and taking it but if you want to if you want to find out how to pick the perfect watermelon check out our other video and you'll know watermelon drop slam everywhere right is there more with this one cut up because I want there's a whole bag a whole garbage bag like a melon don't say garbage [Music] [Music]", "gRRQJPLGArk": "[Music] guys I'm here again with another DIY for my kitchen and this is the fabric lollipop you can make these as large as you want I'm going to show you how to do this this is a very inexpensive adorable and an adorable punch to your Christmas sweet kitchen meet me my craft room I'll show you how okay so to do one large lollipop let's see I'm just gonna measure I'd say it's about 2 and 1/2 yards of this for one again I'm making this big also you can buy these different widths this is a real thick one they come even smaller and I'll probably do a couple small small ones just to show you but let's get started with this one so the first thing I'm gonna do is you're gonna take your hot glue on the tip of this and you're going to put well this is the way I do it anyway you can do it whatever way you want but I'm going to glue down just so this end is already covered okay [Applause] and then you just start winding it what you start winding it whatever way you want okay and make sure when you're winding it that you I wondered in an angle okay like you can see now you can start putting hot glue a little bit I don't put it all over just certain spots but you want to make sure that you're covering in other words you don't want to go like this trying to show you you don't want any of this exposed okay but you don't want to overlap too much because then it's just gonna be too much material and there's no reason to you know use up that material by just overlapping it too much you just want to make sure you're covering enough of the piping to where you're not gonna see it [Applause] okay this would be adorable too for a little girl's room if she had like a candy-themed or oh I don't know or a playroom or for a baby shower think about a baby shower you guys and put big bows on the sticks also let me tell you I didn't even tell you um okay so what you're going to need is you're gonna need your material your piping your dowels and I got these at Walmart I think was well it doesn't have the price it was only a couple dollars and then your hot glue that's it that's all you're gonna need for this so if you see I'm winding it at an angle down but making sure that I'm covering the next piece okay so now I'm just gonna randomly put a little bit of hot glue like I said not on every round but just so it's adhering a little bit every now and again okay and this does not take long you could do this watching television very easy you could make some of these for a birthday party you could make some as a bouquet for a friend [Applause] with a gift card maybe you know what I mean these are you'll see what I mean once it comes together it's very cute [Applause] so I'm gonna keep rapping and then before I start putting it together I'll be back because there's no sense of me just having you sit here watching me wrap this whole thing okay so I have it wrapped okay and I'm getting out of dehl now I'm leaving my Dells natural I want them natural but you if you want you can paint them you can wrap them with ribbon whatever you want but like I said I'm leaving my natural okay so now what we have to do is we have to start wrapping this around to make the shape of our lollipop now this is where you will use the hot glue more okay some people you want to get this tight too some people will go to the even to the point of sewing in between these I don't I'm just going to glue okay so I'm just going in to the between the crevices of where I'm boiling it around [Applause] now you'll see why you need more why you use so much because like I said this was two and a half yards right one doesn't go far once you start doing this and make sure to keep pushing this down so it doesn't start coming up to a peak you want it to lay flat it's a lollipop right I just hold it for a minute [Applause] and you'll get the feel of it you know when you should glue and when it's okay not to and put the glue in enough to where you're not gonna see it I mean sometimes you can't help it but if you can [Applause] just take your time be patient with it let the hot glue dry and as you see I put the glue and then I pull it a little bit and then hold on to it hold it against that last part and remembering to keep pushing down to keep it flat [Applause] I think these are cute when they're exaggerated meaning big you know whimsical looking you're seeing it now right [Applause] this would be adorable for a little girl or boys birthday party in the theme the color of whatever you know the birthday is or if you had like a carnival theme [Applause] cute I love these I really do these are so cute [Applause] and like I said what you could do is you could just be watching TV and wrap these and then the next day glue them you know you don't want to do this if you're tired as far as glowing [Applause] should always have cold water next to you when you're glowing in case you burn yourself [Applause] I just want to make sure that that glue is pushed in tight because you don't want gaps [Applause] and I like making these in threes when you're putting them in a display so I'm gonna go around finish it off and I'll come back to put the stick okay so I have it all glued together okay cute and now you're going to take your stick and decide which side you want to be the front all right so now you're going to glue it now what I do is all glue right about not in the middle a little bit below the middle okay but I'm going to take a little piece of material after I glue this on just to help secure it but first I'm just gonna glue okay [Applause] and then I'm just gonna press down being careful again because that glue can come up on you I've had glue where I've glued my finger and I've had to peel it off real quick and had skin come with it yeah you don't want that so keep your little bowl of ice water [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that could even use really I could use yeah you go well it just helps to secure plus it finishes it off [Applause] and what you could do is get longer dowels if you wanted you know depending if you want them to be different heights or you just put this stick down closer if you want [Applause] I've got paint at O my hands look awful sorry but that's the life of a crafter right okay there you go how adorable is that oh my gosh now all you do is put a ribbon on and I'll get some ribbon when I finish the others to show you and then I'll show you where I'm putting this okay so I have all of the lollipops done okay what I'm gonna do I'm not going to do any more than this because I have others that I bought from that I bought from Hobby Lobby so I have three of the bows already for this I'm gonna put bows down here I was going to put a smaller ribbon I didn't like it so I'm using this really cute and I think it's very whimsical this game like I showed you so I just folded it like you saw then here now you can use wire or Chanel stem I'm just using this game ribbon and I'm gonna come here and short go even now like the two different sizes of gingham it's cute so I'm going to just flip that out this is wired which is nice okay and now we're just going to glue them and I did try to just tie this ribbon you know how you would tie it I did not like the way it looked it was too bulky it just didn't look right to me so my glue gun heated I can't see which bows because I made them different sizes blank down better put the glue on okay these were so much fun you guys and like I said you can do these for any occasion these would be adorable for a little girl's birthday party or little boys they would be adorable baby shower what about a baby shower you look cute in the kitchen okay [Applause] [Applause] okay I'm gonna glue the last one and I'll be back no okay guys so here they are what do you think I think these turned out adorable so I will be showing you where I'm putting these so you'll be seeing these in my home tour for Christmas and you'll see where I'm gonna put these in my gingerbread and peppermint kitchen guys I hope that I've inspired you to try this yourself use any kind of material you can use them for any time it doesn't matter what the holiday not a holiday whatever you want it can be a birthday it can be a shower it can be a holiday it can be or you just want to decorate with a candy theme whatever the case I hope I've inspired you and until we get together again remember the world's a better place because you're in it don't ever ever forget that there's one you and you brings something to this world nobody else can talk to you soon [Music] you", "z7nXJ7Wmv4k": "Oh! What?? No!!! Ever wondered what your face would look like\nas a giant lollipop? Neither have we, but we found out anyway. Firebox is a London-based company that makes\ncustom lollipops the size of your entire face. We know, it\u2019s a dream come true. All you gotta do is submit pictures of yourself\nthrough their website and BAM, they\u2019ll send you the candy version right back. Here are the pictures we sent in. You open it. I\u2019m scared. I see black on the lollipop so it must be\u2026 Oh my god! No!! Oh! You don\u2019t see a surprise then. No!! Why do I look 40?! What are these old-ass wrinkles? I went from 24 to 44 real quick. They cost a whopping $57 each and take around\n2 weeks to ship if you\u2019re in the U.S. \u2014 but they\u2019re hand crafted, so you can\u2019t be\ntoo impatient when living the couture dessert life. As terrifying as they are, we have to admit\n\u2014 the attention to detail is pretty impressive\u2026 Aside from the fact that my lollipop looks\nlike she\u2019s 45. I\u2019m trying not to take it personally. I still look good. CUT TO OUR PRETTY GLAMOUR SHOTS! We wanted to see how convincing they really are. Which was not at all! But we had a little fun around the office\nanyway. So we get that these lollipops are meant to\nlook like us, but the REAL question is, how do they taste? This is a part of Alex\u2019s ear from a candy. Can you eat it and see what it tastes like? Sugar? Does it have any flavor other than sugar? Is it fruit? It\u2019s some sort of fruit. A peach! Peach. It tastes like peach candy. It\u2019s actually not bad. What does it taste like? Like peach. It turns out we actually taste pretty good. It doesn\u2019t just taste like sugar \u2014 which\nis honestly a relief because I could, and would, eat my entire face. So are these really worth the hefty price tag? Probably not, but if you had $57 to drop on\na big-ass lollipop, this could be the perfect treat for you. You\u2019re getting more than just a giant sucker\nthat looks like your face. The minor details are pretty on point and\nwould make it a great, unique gift for someone you know. Just make sure you send in a flattering picture\nof them. In conclusion, this big ol\u2018 lollipop is extra AF, and we can\u2019t really tell you if dropping\n$57 on a sucker is worth it. But if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, then go for it!", "a1icutJ42pg": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everyone its Lara from our early house comm and today I'm going to show you guys how to make a healthy lollipop and this recipe is in perfect timing for Easter if you follow me over on Instagram you saw my stories that me and my kiddos were working really hard on coming up with this recipe it took us several different tries to finally nail down a sucker that would pop out of one of these molds and it tasted good when it gets close to holidays I like to think of things that I can kind of recreate so they can stick to a more clean eating healthy lifestyle even during the holiday time but I don't like them to not be able to have all the fun things that kids have and so I know in a few weeks when it's Easter time there's gonna be a lot of candy and suckers and things like that and so I thought I would try to come up with a recipe where they can still indulge in suckers but not get all those food dyes and refined sugars to make this sucker we are going to be using coconut sugar and honey as our sweetener so because it's still going to be really sugary it's not something that you want to give your kiddos all the time but more for a special treat but at least it isn't refined sugar and it's a much healthier option than giving them store-bought suckers so to get started we are going to turn this on about medium heat and then we are going to bring the ingredients that I have here which is coconut sugar honey and apple juice to a hard crack stage which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit so I am going to pour in I have 1/2 a cup of coconut sugar and I talked all about coconut sugar and the different benefits of it over on the blog if you're interested then I'm pouring in 1/4 of a cup honey and then I'm going to use two tablespoons of apple juice now if you don't want to use apple juice you can just use water that will make the suckers turn out just fine I just thought if I added in some apple juice it would add a little bit more flavor okay so I'm going to let this come to a boil now I'm going to stir it a few times and check it with my candy thermometer until it reaches 300 degrees now this part is crucial if you don't stir it often enough or if it goes over that 300 degrees then your sucker will taste burnt and if you don't get up to that 300 degrees it will not solidify and turns hard like a sucker and believe me I know we messed up multiple times so make sure that you have a trusty thermometer and now you keep an eye on this because the temperature that you get it out is definitely crucial but other than that this recipe is foolproof and it's really easy to make while this is warming up I'm going to prepare my sucker molds and by preparing I just mean putting the stick in you don't have to grease it at all or spray with anything once they are hardened the suckers pop out really easily I found these sucker molds on Amazon and they are adorable these are two of the molds that came with it actually has three more designs that it came with and it has little circles with swirls in it and flowers I think there was smiley faces stars and hearts so these are super fun because it makes the suckers and all different types of shapes which the kids love and the other thing I really liked about these molds is that they came with reusable sucker sticks so these are little plastic reusable sucker sticks and they just popped right into the mold and so I'm going to push these in now and then we'll be ready to fill these when our liquid is ready [Music] [Music] after you remove it from the heat and kind of stir it a little bit let the bubbles go down I like to add in some essential oils for flavor so you can do citrus oils are really good we are doing wild orange today you can do lime I have tangerine we've done lemon all of those kind of make a fun lollipop for the kiddos and so I am doing about 15 drops here of wild orange and that just makes it taste super good now we're just going to pour it into our molds and then you're gonna let these sit for about 30 minutes or until they are completely hardened and then you can pop them out and let the kiddos enjoy them [Music] [Music] last week I shared a recipe for some healthy Easter jello so if you guys missed that video I will link that down in the description below and if this is your very first time by my channel I would love it if you hit that subscribe button I get out new videos every single week on essential oil education healthy recipes and natural remedies thank you so

video bye guys", "GAShBDghjYE": "[Music] [Music] okay guys welcome back to my channel we are going to be connecting these pool noodles to pool noodles together to make one really long one we're going to use these to make lollipops and this one I have already done but basically just for extra stability instead of just gluing them together I put some hot glue on the toothpicks and inserted them now I'm going to put hot glue on this end pretty well saturate it so that when it goes through there's going to be glue also around those giving it just a little more stability alright once we do that we're going to use the white duct tape and we're going to stripe this like a candy cane but once we get that done we're actually going to be rolling it into a circle to make the lollipop alright so we'll be right back alright so we're gonna come right up here at the top and I like to kind of stretch it as I go to make it fit fairly tight to be perfect this is gonna be rolled up and it's gonna wrinkle the tape a little bit anyway but we just keep rolling the pool noodle just keep going until we get the entire thing done as you can see here it's striping it quite nice alright I won't make you watch me do the whole thing okay so we have it striped and we're ready to roll it up into the shape of the lollipop and if you'll notice those little white dots that is some double stick tape I forgot the brand it was something like super glue or something that made them that is just for a little extra insurance if you will because this is plastic and it has that sheen on it and when you start rolling this up I mean it's hard to glue plastic anyway but when you start rolling it up it starts putting that pressure to unroll so I just wanted a little added added stickiness if you will so now we're ready and I'm just gonna put some glue here at the end first you can see that but we're going to start down here at the end and then we're just going to fold this over and hold it tight and let that glue set up just a little it's comfortable okay now while I'm holding that I'm gonna go ahead and put some more glue all the way up to the sticky thing and in between these two and so we're just gonna roll it then I'm gonna hold it again [Music] you so you can see what it's looking like here now one side is always going to look better than the other so once we're actually ready to put it together will determine which is going to be the front and which is the back I do want to grab a rag real quick this is what I did with the other eye rubber bands were not big enough so I tied it off and I'll let it cure for a day or so look can you see that this is why I want it to cure I don't know how they do it on the other videos that they don't unroll or if they're editing so that you don't see where they're trying to enroll so this I'm going to let that sit for a few days and we will be back when we're ready to put the dowel rod in and put the cellophane on with the bow but this at least gives you an idea of what you're going to be looking at looking like and I wanted you to be able to see how tight that is and that it's not as easy as it's made to look on some of the videos you're definitely gonna have to fight to keep it rolled while that glue cures and if you can do anything to give it a little added help I would say do it and as you can see I'll sipping bring it up close see where it came apart in the middle there's a lot of pressure when you're rolling these things up because they're not in that shape they're meant to be straight so anyway just wanted you to see the things that can go wrong as well as how cute it can turn out we just need to let this cure so I'll see you in a bit okay just a quick look at some of these that are rolled the green one there as you can see I just did solid color and that one has the flat edge shaved off to make it roll a little easier and and I do like the way it turned out its tapered there at the end where I was able to pull it in tight here's one of the the red and white stripe that I put some glitter in the crevices just to see what that was going to look like there's one that's already under cellophane that one I don't know if you can tell by the video but the tape is coming off of it that was used that was made with Dollar Tree tape I won't get that anymore and then there's the one that was actually in the video that I rolled up and I have it under the cellophane here is one that has been cut in half wrapped in the tape and then rolled up just to show you what that would look like it's definitely an easier roll but it's not as big lollipop there's another solid color this is one of them that was cut in half and rolled so you have that flat edge that you're rolling this one I would use less glue on the next time because I don't know if you can see it in the video but you can see glue dried on it see there in the crevices but that was the first one that I had done and I was using a lot of glue so I would back off on the glue a little but I do like the look of those that are cut in half it's just a little different so if you're mixing these you know I think it would be a fun look now because they're made with pool noodles and duct tape plus wrapped in cellophane you can put these outside easily I'm going to try that this year I do want to see what the weather does to them as far as the heat and then the Sun that's out during the day I want to see if it loosens any of the glue that's my curiosity but they're made to be outside of course you could also put them inside and now I did make something really cute whenever I shaved off the flat edge on the lollipops I took that flooded flat edge and rolled it up and it made these cute little lollipops so you could put a dowel rod in that and either put them outside on a flowerpot or you could even put them on a tree these were the two I did though I hadn't made any others yet with the red or anything but just to see what they were going to look like before I threw the shavings away I do think they're adorable so I'll hang on to those as well so nothing's wasted so anyway guys hope you enjoyed this video and it inspires you to make some yard decorations and I think this will be the last Christmas decoration video at least for a while I just wanted to have these up early enough in case you wanted to do some crafts before the holiday decorating started so have a great week but bye [Music]", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "ZNri5C00aik": "and then failed high school student winds up in the hospital after eating some lollipops yeah these weren't any old lollipops

the size of my palm so they're pretty big you can make these as big or as little as you want to so these are just a few that I made so what you're gonna need in this video a skewer lollipop stick or a cake pop stick whichever one you prefer now I use the skewers because they are a little bit longer but they do get heavy like the longer it is they do get heavy so it tends to bend a little bit I haven't had any snap on me but so first I'm gonna show you guys how I make my twist lollipops alright guys so you will need some polymer clay any color that you want to use you can I'm gonna be using a pearl teal color purple color and also a dusty rose color and a white need this for a little while just until it becomes soft so this is what we call making a cane so first you're gonna make a cane they're not really difficult I know they look kind of difficult and you're like how the heck did you make that well it's pretty easy alright so you want to make it about the same but you want to make these smaller and take some of our white make about three smaller ones to go in between each of these alright so with our white piece of clay we're gonna take our colors and we're just gonna start placing those on [Music] what you want to do is you want to mash these together mash those mash it on down [Music] [Music] just because those two are getting kind of close together and it might cover up that white I'm gonna put a piece of white right here just to make sure it doesn't cover up the white but I'm gonna put a little piece right here that way these won't cover up the white either [Music] [Music] kind of thin it's not too thin but it's getting kind of thin so you're just gonna turn it you're just gonna turn it you're just gonna start spinning it make sure you're very light which and he asked cuz you don't want to mess it up so you're just gonna turn it turn it alright guys so once you have that you're gonna sit it out the way and what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna make another one and this one's going to be teal and white [Music] [Applause] alright guys for my lollipop twist I like to use a skewer so I just take the skewer and I just wrap the cane around the skewer just wrap around it's really easy self-explanatory you guys can see it so you pretty much get it [Music] and what you're gonna do now is place both of them on a baking sheets I put a little foil down and then I put it in my toaster oven and I bake my super slow but I want you guys to read the directions on the back of your package so that you can do it correctly next up we have our lollipops so I'm going to show you guys how to make this really quickly [Music] [Music] dead of rolling this around a stick we're just gonna roll this on itself as he you come up with a big spiral circle that looks like a pinwheel then you're just gonna stick a lollipop stick in there I get in the oven Inger done now I did add some extra glitter for this because I wanted it to be sparkly so that's optional you can do that if you want to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so after its baked and it's been cool for a while I'm just gonna take some of my triple thick gloss that I got from Hobby Lobby and I'm gonna glaze this up real nice now this is optional it looks beautiful the way it is but you can opt to make it a little more shine here so do this if you want to if you want to keep it matte looking

you will have to scrape away the excess chocolate from the sides of the cast place the lollipop sticks into the stick channels and give them a 180-degree turn to ensure that the chocolate adheres well

Maple\nQueen. We're going to need the following ingredients:\na cup of maple syrup, a cup of corn syrup, a cup of white sugar, a candy thermometer,\na small saucepan, lollipop molds, sticks, and bags. I have already prepared the lollipop molds\nby lightly spraying them and inserting the lollipop sticks, and I have set them aside. And now I'm going to combine the ingredients\nin a small saucepan. A cup of maple syrup, a cup of corn syrup,\na cup of white sugar, and I'm going to mix this in a little. This will melt as it gets hotter. I'm going to insert the candy thermometer,\nand we are  going to cook over medium heat until it gets\nto 300 degrees. It's important to not leave your syrup unattended\nas it could boil over or it could reach a temperature too high. Once your syrup reaches 300 degrees transfer\nit to a spouted glass measuring cup capable of withstanding high temperatures. Ok, now you are going to let this cool to\n270 degrees, remove the thermometer, and immediately pour into the prepared lollipop molds. When finished you can clean your utensils\nby boiling in hot water. I prefer to get my lollipop supplies from\nLeader Evaporator, a supplier of maple equipment and supplies for more than a century. After filling the molds, let them sit at room\ntemperature until hardened. Remove from the mold and immediately place\ninto bags and tie with a pretty ribbon or string.

Today I'm gonna show you how to make the cutest chocolate lollipops. So if you haven't made\nchocolate lollipops before, I'm gonna walk you through all the steps on how to make it, and yours\nwill turn our perfectly. So let's get started. So first you have a choice\nbetween two different kinds of chocolate when you're\nmaking a lollipop. So you can either use regular chocolate, like finding a chocolate\nbar at the grocery store and melting it down using that, or you can use Candy Melts. The difference between the two is that Candy Melts is set at room temperature, they're also called Mercken's, and they stay hard at room temperature. You don't have to do any extra effort. Other chocolate, or more pure chocolate, because candy melts are\nkind of compound chocolate, not really actually\nchocolate kind of thing. Some people love the taste of them, I personally don't but\nthey're very pretty candy. (laughs) and they're really good\nif you are new to this. But if you prefer the flavor of real, traditional chocolate, there\nare some other steps for you. So you can either temper your chocolate, which I've tried so many\ntimes and I have failed, and where you bring the chocolate up to a certain temperature\nand then cool it slightly, and then bring it up the\ntemperature again, I think. And either way, it gives\nthe chocolate that beautiful glossiness to it and it makes\nit snap when you break it. When you melt chocolate\nit gets untempered, so you have to re-temper it\nevery time that you melt it. So yeah, that takes a lot of effort. You can buy tempering machines if you really want to invest in it. But usually what I do at home if I want to actually use\nchocolate instead of Candy Melts is I just pop it in the fridge and I store the lollipops in the fridge, and they will stay nice and firm while they're in the fridge. But they will soften a little\nbit at room temperature. So the Candy Melt option allows you to kinda handle it a little bit more, and they won't melt in transportation. And you can keep it room temperature. If you're using real chocolate, like just a chocolate bar that you get at the grocery store and melt down. You're gonna want to\nkeep it in the fridge, and keep it in the fridge\nuntil you give it to the person and have them put it back in the fridge. So it's totally up to you, but those are the two differences. All right so today I\ndecided to use Candy Melts because we have the cutest color. We are using pink Candy Melts today. And if you want to pick some up, I'll link them down below. Wilton makes a ton of them, this video isn't sponsored by them, but everything I used\nwas actually from Wilton. So all the products that you use will be linked below if\nyou want to pick them up. So I'm using pink and brown Candy Melts to get my desired effect. But again, you can use\nwhatever you'd like. So first things first, you\nwant to pop the Candy Melts, or your chocolate, whatever you'd like, this is the same for either material, into a microwave safe bowl. And microwave it at 30 second intervals, stirring each interval and just keep going until it is fully melted. The reason why we melt\nthem at 30 second intervals is so that you don't burn the\nchocolate or the Candy Melts. If you heat them too much, they can burn, and they can get all lumpy. I remember someone commented\nsaying that happened. And that's what happens,\nchocolate can burn, it's really frustrating. So you just want to gradually\nheat it and melt it. Another tool that I have\nthat has saved my life, it changed everything for me, get a little melting pot from Wilton. What it is, is basically\na little silicone pot that you put in another little thing. And when you turn that\non, it gently heats, you know the Candy Melts or the chocolate. And so it allows them to\nmelt without burning it. So this is more of a fail safe option, if you want to use it. If you're melting chocolate\na lot of the time, get this, it's so much\neasier, oh my goodness. So once your chocolate or\nCandy Melts have melted, pour them into any kid\nof mold that you'd like. So for lollipop sticks, you want to get the molds\nthat have the little spot to put the lollipop stick. I'll link a couple down\nbelow for Valentine's Day, since Valentine's Day is\ncoming up pretty soon. And then after they're in, grab a little lollipop stick, again these are also from Wilton, and just kind of swirl it\nin the chocolate a little so that you coat all sides of\nthe tip of the lollipop stick and then just set it into the little space it's supposed to be. Coating it on all sides just makes it a little bit more secure and so that when it's completely hardened, the lollipop stick will\nstay inside your lollipop. And now what you want to do is carefully transfer that to the fridge. Candy Melts do set at room temperature, but they set even faster in the fridge. And they set a little bit firmer. If you're using pure chocolate, I usually put it in the freezer because it sets much\nquicker in the freezer. You can put it in the fridge, but you'll be waiting\nmaybe like an hour or so. Whereas the Candy Melts it's like 15 minutes and then you're done. So then just un-mold them and you can get some more Candy Melts to\ndo a little drizzle effect. I like that effect because it makes them look like chocolate truffles. I melted some brown Candy Melts. And I popped them into a piping bag and I just snipped the end\nof the pipping bag off. So that will create a really beautiful and consistent drizzle. Sometimes you can drizzle it with like a fork or a knife. You can just dip it in your chocolate. But if you want it to look like more natural, and professional, and cleaner, and you want the drizzle to have kind of a consistent weight to it, put it in a pipping bag, or a Ziploc bag, and just snip a little hole at the end. It'll make your life so much easier. And then pop them back into the fridge for that layer to set, and we are done. So thank you so much for watching. I hope that you like this video.

Bye.", "4sfOiLjglac": "hi guys welcome back to my channel in today's video I am going to share with you how to make these really cool giant life of decorations they're really effective and if you look online you can actually find them and they are quite expensive so it's definitely worth making them at home if you fancy being a little bit creative if you watching this video and you're new to my channel I would love to you subscribe I post loads of different DIY videos on my channel so if you like that kind of thing then I would love for you to hit that button it down below so for this DIY you are going to need some pool noodles so I have got two two blue ones and I have got two yellow ones because I am making these two different and lollipops the reason you're going to need two noodles of each color is because you want to join them together like this because if you just use one noodle you're naughty pop will not be a giant so as well as using two noodles you're also going to need some duct tape I have got this pink one because together with the yellow and the blue it just looks really really effective we're also going to me that some piping this is actually just poking from whips you can get from any hardware store and it's actually just like a plumbing pipe it's like a solid one that's hollow so it's really really good for this DIY you're also going to need a glue gun and finishing touches you are going to need some of these compact sticks because this is what I kind of use as well to secure everything together and then since cellophane in a bone to finish everything off so what I would suggest you do first of all is get your cool noodles and just bend them slightly this is going to make them a little bit more flexible because when you buy your pool noodles to begin with they are quite rigid and tough so obviously you as you will be bending them you want them to be quite flexible and I just got these from Amazon so you can kind of get this pool noodles anywhere they're $1.99 a noodle and you like I said and buy these big lollipops for quite a lot more than that so it's definitely worth making your own if you are interesting right so the first thing that you want to do is to get some of your glue garnet blue and then stick your two pool noodles together once but quite generous onto two ends of your pool noodles so they stick together and just hold them like that for a couple of minutes to make sure everything is dry and they will stay in place what I also like to do is go over the join in the middle of first off so I will wrap my tape around there and then I will get your duct tape and then just work your way down the pool noodles wrapping it around this way it gives a really nice lollipop look and it gives a really kind of vibrant look as well what I try to do is make sure I go in with a join in the middle as well just to kind of like straightening up so once you have done that then you're ready to roll when it comes to the rolling process it is quite hard work so you need to either get someone in to help you I got my husband Chris as he was the official roller and I would put on all of the glue stick down at the very first part of the roll this is I would say the hardest bit to get stuck so just make sure if you have this bit right then the rest of your noodle will roll up really really well as you work your way down and you don't just keep on applying your hot glue gun glue and just do it really slowly to make sure everything sets while you are rolling once you have finished rolling up your noodle you can then secure everything with your kebab sticks I just put four kebab sticks and I push them through the middle to get all the little sections to join together once you have done that you are then ready to cut a hole at the base of your joint roll up and you can then pop your little filament tubing into the hole I like to secure mine with a little bit more glue and just to make sure it doesn't go anywhere once you have done that you are then ready to wrap everything in same thing pop a bow around it and you are ready to decorate your party [Music] so much for watching today's video I hope you enjoyed it let me know if you try these out at home and I will see you next time bye guys [Music]", "VfFmaCwmaBY": "hey guys today I'm going to be making a lollipop bouquet but this time it's not going to be a topiary it's going to be in a cool ice cream sundae dish so I got this in a set of four it's a six inch tall ice cream sundae dish it's a glass like a cobalt blue glass really pretty you can get these in clear I also saw some in like a light pink and some other colors but I really like the blue and I'm going to be using some the silly straws I think I'm going to do the yellow because I have the yellow tissue paper but you'll want to get you some foam balls unless you've got some styrofoam leftover from some packaging that you can cut down to size to fit into your your glass dish and you'll need some dum dum lollipops I've got this huge box I've also got some fit zero pops that we're leftover and I'm going to use those for the top to make a sort of like a cherry on top type of a look and some ribbon I've got a little bit of this happy birthday ribbon which is good because this one is for a birthday and then some that have the the blue and yellow balloon this is a three inch foam ball I got a package of six can see that this just plugs right down inside of this particular ice cream sundae dish that I have it may be a little bit too low into my dish because it really needs to be about like this in order for you to properly put your suckers around however I didn't have a four inch foam ball the other alternative I have is this five inch but as you can see it's going to be way too tall for me for what I want to do so what I am going to do is just work with this 3 inch ball I'm going to wrap it in this tissue paper and be pushing that into my ice cream sundae dish so that it actually will help my foam ball sit up higher but the yellow paper will go down in here into the dish to kind of offset some of the blue you don't have to have anything into the dish or an alternative is if you really want to get crazy with the candy you could put some Hershey's Kisses or whatever their favorite candy is down here in the bottom but you want to be sure that whatever you're using it if it's styrofoam or if it's these little foam balls that you wrap this in the tissue paper so that if you do have candies down in the bottom of the ditch you don't contaminate it with any kind of styrofoam or foam shavings that may flake off now wrap the styrofoam ball in the tissue paper and I have just set that down into the glass dish by putting this tissue paper on this 3-inch fall now this sets up high for what I need and it also fits nicely in the opening so I don't even have to shave anything down for this I've got some multi-flavored deliciousness going on here with my first tier of the dum dum lollipops so I've just put a first row of suckers here on the bottom but where the glass dish and the foam ball meet I poked them in to the side there they they have a little bit of a an angle going into the foam ball and you don't have to do that you can have them going straight in like even some of mine here are not perfectly straight or sloped I have them differing because as you put these suckers in this the stem of the sucker for the lollipop when you stick that in there you're going to be fighting with the rest of the sticks as you go along because these are you know it's a small area to put all these suckers in so you just have to kind of work them in however you can but for the most part I try to make them as uniform as possible now for the second row I'm going to take the dum dum lollipops again but everywhere that I have a space like right here I am going to pop another sucker and then go all the way around doing that with another row of the dum dum lollipops here is that second row of suckers and this is just some more dum dum lollipop like I said I was spacing it to where this next row of suckers would go in between the bottom two so that you have an even coverage it just makes it look a little bit better and then also alternate your colors as well because you don't want to put the same flavour right side by side and if it works out as you're going along that maybe you have you know two root beers diagonally then you can just change that out if you want to unless somebody just really likes root beer suckers and then you could just load it full of them on this open area here you can do a couple of things a video that where I got this idea to put this into a Sun a dish she used blow pops for the next row so that they would then kind of stick up more because the blue pops are large in size just like the Tootsie Roll pops and then her Center on top was these cherry flavored tootsie rolls I don't have any blow pops so I'm just going to make more of the center with filling in with some dum-dums and then I've got several here of these red cherry to SeaWorld Pops oh you can mix that up however you want to do it I'm just going to use a third row of the done dubs and now I'm going to put in my red 2-0 pops here in this area and then put the raspberry in the very center so actually what I'm going to do I'm going to go ahead I found the very center of that I'm going to go ahead and push this down and notice I left it really tall because that is going to be my cherry on top and to further the cherry aspect I'm going to fill this in with the red Tootsie Roll pops so that it looks like just one big massive mound of cherry the only other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take some extra suckers and just go around and anywhere I've got holes like you see I have a little bit of a little baby hole right there I'll pop another sucker in I did wind up going ahead and making a fourth row the dum dum lollipops since I don't have any blow pops I'm just going ahead and using those up so I wound up with it was 60 dum dum lollipops and all because once I made the additional rows of the Dum Dums because I didn't have any blow pops I then also went around and filled in any little holes which I did have some holes around on the bottom so I filled in those holes I grouped my red 2-0 pops and the raspberry tootsie roll pop I grouped those closer together so that it would look like a massive cherry on top the other thing I'm going to do is take one of my silly straws and I'm going to use the yellow one since I used the yellow tissue paper in the center to cover the foam ball I'm going to put the silly straw into the suckers and it will color coordinate with that yellow tissue paper I have now put the straw into my sundae you could actually do it at more of an angle if you wanted to I'm not going to I think that looks cute and I'm going to put some ribbon around the bottom you don't have to I've just got some birthday ribbon and some celebration ribbon some with some coordinating balloons that match the tissue paper and that blue dish this is the final item here I made with dum dum lollipops and some tootsie roll pops a silly straw that has a little squiggle and then I put some finishing touches of some happy birthday ribbon and some ribbon that's got the matching blue and yellow balloons and if you get those jumbo bags of the dum-dums and you only want to use dum-dums then you could actually just do the entire thing with them domes you don't have to worry about trying to make a cherry on top I think this turned out really cute and I also put the link to the lady's video that I got this from I think it was right out cutlery I don't know if I'm saying that right but anyway she did a really cute or actually two too cute ones using those blow pops that way you can see what it looks like but anyway this is my version of it with sometimes n20 pops she'll also be able to keep Sunday class and have some ice cream later so I think that's a really great idea and so cute to do for one person it's also you know if you're going to have like a candy buffet table this is still a cute idea to do instead of the dumb dumb topiary trees if you just want to go with like an ice cream social type of theme you can also if you have a themed like baby showers and things in certain colors you can go to Oriental Trading calm and get suckers that are in specific colors and then do an entire candy bouquet a lollipop okay in that one specific color if you want to I like to have it all mixed up I think that looks really cute and it's something happy you can do this for someone who's in the hospital this is a great Getwell gift and birthdays it's just do anything that you want to do with it for tonight's sunday bouquet of suckers I'm going to try something different I thought it would be cute to use marshmallows to be the whipped cream on top of the sundae and then put a lone cherry Tootsie Roll pop in the very middle for the cherry so we'll have the the sundae the whipped cream and the cherry on top in order to do the marshmallow suckers I already had some in stock but they're these 6-inch sticks that I got at Joanne's and I just popped a six inch stick into the base of one of my marshmallows and then I add some little love some little Silla Fame bags these are the kind that you do the pretzels in or so I just use that and cut the bag off to the size that I need it and then just put the twisty tie on it so this is going to be a little bit taller and that's what you want because you want the whip cream to be on the top bye guys thanks so much for watching and have a sparkle rific day you", "tp3pKeXOkZg": "today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops but not just any [ __ ] lollipops these ones have got vodka written and if you have enough of them it's going to be a good [ __ ] night but before we begin I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone I'm ready who shared my video I've got the word out there that means a hell of a lot to me so thank you very much anyway vodka lollipops first of all you're gonna need some vodka about quarter of a pint and a tablespoon of powdered food coats followed by 450 grams of sugar add the vodka to a measuring jug with a little bit of water and then put a pan on a low heat and add the sugar a glucose and lastly the vodka next year stir it until it dissolves and then crank it up to a high heat and put the lid on then just put grease proof paper onto a baking tray and get you all these sticks out after about three minutes just get the mixture and pour it onto the lolly sticks the shape might come out a bit weird if you're not very good at it as you can see like I am but it doesn't matter because you can still eat them anyone after you've done that just let them call until they pardon oh these are delicious I know that the shape came out a bit weird but nonetheless it's a sugary lollipop with [ __ ] vodka in it what gets better than that make sure that you subscribe make sure you tell your friends since that's the only way we can get this [ __ ] show out there and I really appreciate you guys talking about talking about how you're going to do your recipe so leave a comment below I'm off to get drunk on sweet", "0rW3NHgY9PI": "[Music] hi friends it's auntie CooCoo and today I'm sharing with you guys my Christmas in July DIY so the summer is a great time to get some crafting done before the busyness of the holiday set in this year out front I want to do a whole gingerbread candy land theme and summer is also the perfect time to pick up pool noodles so let me show you what you'll need for this project first I picked up two of each color of pool noodles from the Dollar Tree as well as some colored duct tape I also picked up some of this clear wrap now out of this one roll you can wrap 2 of our giant lollipops then you'll need a plunger yes a toilet plunger from the Dollar Tree one for each lollipop and I just pulled out some white paint I had on hand to go ahead and paint it to look like a candy stick you'll also need lots of hot glue I also figured out rubber bands came very much in handy for this project let's get started the first thing I did was remove the sticker from my plunger and I left the plunger portion on as it made a handy stand for me to paint it I went ahead and gave each plunger two coats of paint letting them dry thoroughly in between and after and now we'll just set it aside and get started on our pool noodles remove your stickers from both then we're going to glue them end and I used my hot glue for this and once I had held them in place to stick for a few minutes I went ahead and added a layer of duct tape to secure them now let's go ahead and take our duct tape up to the top and get started on striping our candy so just start at the top winding it evenly removing any bumps and then it became quite easy to go ahead and tuck in the top portion doing this on a large flat surface definitely made it more easy I would just pull the tape out and then roll my noodle continuing all the way to the bottom before I snipped off my tape and tucked it in now I found where both the duct tapes met and decided which side was going to be on the outside and which part I was going to hide inside of the Roll I did find out that doing just about two or three passes of hot glue is more than enough it's most important to hold it in place while eight dries so for that we're going to go ahead and pull out those rubber bands I mentioned after you've glued it together and secure it so that it can continue to dry for at least 10 or 15 minutes now it's time to attach our candy stick once your noodle has dried it's time to remove the rubber bands and get started attaching our stick so you can do this with either a razor blade or scissors I just poke my scissors in twice to make an X and then go ahead and start cutting to connect those little triangles and then you can remove them then you're going to want to stick your scissors through to sort of puncture the next two layers and sort of carp it out now it's time for our hot glue I filled it up with quite a bit before 6:00 my stick pushing it down through three layers and letting it dry now we're going to do our clear wrap you may want to have on hand a rubber band or a zip tie before you get started on this just measure out the amount that you like go ahead and cut it and then it's time to wrap it around your lollipop gathering it around the bottom before securing it with either a rubber band or ribbon you could stop here I decided to pull out some white ribbon I had on hand and use it as a bow so I'm using two zip ties removing that rubber band and some ribbon I had on hand just securing the first zip tie and then snipping off the bottom to create the bow turning it over and tightening the second zip tie and again snipping off the bottom and that's all there is to it I just love them and I know if I were to go to a store and try and buy them they would cost me so much more they only cost me 450 apiece I'm really relieved to know that I've already knocked out this DIY and they'll be waiting for me to decorate the front of our home come December I hope you guys enjoyed seeing this Christmas in July DIY thank you so much for watching and I'll see you back very soon in the next video you", "h53AKwAqL7E": "hey there welcome to another edition of DIY Friday I'm your host Liana Halldor for Halldor homes here in Sacramento California we're right in the midst of flu and cold season so I wanted to show you a quick and fun remedy you can make at home for those persistent coughs today we'll be making honey lollipops these can be used for stirring into tea eating on their own or as a little Getwell gift I especially like these if you have little ones as a lot of cough syrups are not safe until age six let's get started here are two tools that will help this project go a lot easier first I've got my candy thermometer this is really gonna help you gauge when to stop boiling the candy so it is just the right texture for the lollipops the second is my favorite measuring cup for measuring sticky things like honey what's great about this product is that when you pull the cup down you just fill it with the sticky liquid and then pop it right out no mess start with adding 1/2 cup of sugar 1/3 cup of honey and two tablespoons of water to a stainless steel or aluminum saucepan with a wooden spoon stir ingredients gently so there are no splashes on the sides of the pan turn burner on to low heat and stir until all sugars dissolved about 5 minutes now attach the thermometer to the pan and let sugar mixture boil on medium low heat until temperature reads 295 degrees Fahrenheit or the hard crack stage while candy is boiling place a sheet of parchment or wax paper on your preping surface to help with any spills when pouring the liquid place the sticks in the molds make sure you are keeping a very close eye on the boiling liquid as you do not want it to burn or scorch as soon as it hits the correct temperature take the pan off the heat and add the lemon juice or extract ginger and cinnamon and stir well pour the liquid into the mold slowly there may be bubbles so you can go back over the unfold once once it has bubbled down once the molds are filled push the sticks to make sure they are fully coated and leave to cool at room temperature once lollipops are fully cooled you can decide if you want to store them or give them that way as gifts place parchment or wax paper on work surface peel lollipops out of the molds and place on the paper if there was open flow gently tap the lollipops with a butter knife and it should flake right off lollipops should be kept stored in the airtight container to keep them from getting sticky layer parchment paper or wax paper between each layer when storing if giving us a gift is clear good fats as rappers [Music] tie your ribbon around the bottom to keep the wrapping airtight incorporate a fun lug to give with the gift add some tea bags to the mug and a piece of wrapping paper for color [Music] all done [Music] are you silly huh [Music] [Laughter]", "Fs4fJYrX9JM": "I've already made a lollipop video but I have these brand new molds so I'm going to make more lollipops but with a different recipe this recipe is from Loraine oils from their website and that's two cups of sugar 3/4 cup water and 2/3 cups of corn syrup stir it up wipe down the sides with the wet paper towel so that the sugar doesn't crystallize and we're gonna keep stirring this gently until the sugars dissolved this time I'm using watermelon flavor by the rain oils and I'll be using red food coloring you'll need a candy thermometer to check the temperature before I use this laser then it's not ready yet prepare your molds by putting a little oil on your finger and rubbing it in there I don't know if that's necessary or not have the stick portion go halfway through your lollipop pick about 15 minutes to get to the 300 degrees add your flavoring it'll steam up a little bit and the red food coloring [Music] you can start pouring the lollipops now but if you're going to add citric acids you need to wait until it's a the temperature is below 265 degrees ok this is about 260 degrees so I'm going to add two teaspoons of citric acid and you want to add it at less than 265 degrees or the citric acid will burn [Music] [Music] [Music] this is an example of losing losing control but you can just knock off those extra bits so lollipops are pretty easy to make and they're pretty inexpensive because they're basically sugar corn syrup and water and whatever flavoring that you want to add the citric acid is optional but it gives it a nice sour flavor because some of the flavors are not that great on their own you can wrap these up in little plastic baggies with the little ribbon and they make cute little gifts great for Valentine's Day or any holiday thanks for watching [Music]", "4SuWqm67hZY": "[Music] hey y'all welcome back to our channel my name is rod this is my daughter and today we're going to be trying toffee lollipops and it has chili powder with it but yeah me personally um i honestly do not even like takis um that's one that's one of the kids things um not really my cup of tea but when my daughter saw it in the store she felt like that'd be a good thing to put on there i don't think they have these at walmart i have not seen them at walmart and i actually look for them at walmart end up finding them at the dollar tree yeah no i'm live um and actually it was just a dollar for three lollipops um about two packs yeah so we ended up buying two packs so i'm not saying we could eat i know i'm not gonna eat all three of them more like this thing yeah it's more like this will be the kids thing so we will give it a shot and give y'all uh honest opinion and we will go from there make sure you like comment subscribe and share this video yes so we could have opened it up let you open yours up okay so okay so at first when i felt it in the car it felt weird because like i felt this powder stuff but i didn't feel the lollipop until i took like a different spot right and i thought the lollipop turned by itself and then the powder okay so the way it's filling is the lollipop in here and it's a powder here now i'm assuming the way to eat it is to probably you know taste the lollipop for a little while and then dip it in the powder and then kind of have your whole sensation from it i would like to repeat it again i do not like tacos i just want to throw that out there taki's are good though he just don't like the way it tastes or whatever i don't know why kids like them like kids all over the world love tacos and i really feel like i don't know if y'all need to get looked at yeah so let me go try this out oh wow yeah i don't like the way she just said that okay so it already has the chili powder so he can't can't even taste the sucker oh wow okay so this stuff is drenched on the other side and it's crazy because like i don't know if you're supposed to keep on smell spicy so this is the thing yeah why is sucker spicy like some of these suckers spicy they're good why i can smell it from here i can smell it from here i'm trying to okay all right so what we gonna do is we gotta give it a shot um y'all keep your fingers frost at least for me i think she'll probably like it i like the smell but it smells hot but it smells like something i had before honestly and if anybody i've already tried this please comment below i want to know your results from this and see y'all comments on how this tastes so anyway further ado bang it's good to me why i know it is oh the sauce reminds me of them you know the mexican um lemon suckers i mean mango suckers are you okay that's it oh my god is this a dessert like is this candy ah wow whoa that's a different something just seriously oh my god i don't know why she's seriously [Music] don't bother you at all okay we have different taste buds um is it chewy no i think this is mango flavored how do you know that it tastes like mango i can tell you what it tastes like to me but okay i had one of these before but in a different shape it's like one of the mexican suckers i wanna i will show y'all i'll show y'all uh this ain't right um oh yeah that was it for me y'all um my results from ned from one to ten i'm going with nick negative one oh my god that is a weird taste whoever liked this like i said please tell me why you like it it's good yeah it's mango flavor all right so with that being said um i'm going to set up a dentist appointment tomorrow because i'm pretty sure she better lose half her teeth off chewing candy like that i'm just saying like you gross are you i still taste it in my mouth any comments it tastes like mango i'm gonna keep saying it but it tastes like mango like it's it's the candy that i'm talking about is really good it's really good i'm gonna take a word for it um that was our quick review i don't know how she's doing that she's a she's a soldier i'm definitely gonna throw the rest of this away because i can't take it or you can have the rest of it you got other kids here yeah i'm just saying yeah i definitely don't want it but that's our flip flop she love it i hate it but like i said i didn't i don't i'm not a fan of talkies anyway so and she's still doing it very disgusting anyway that's it for us today if y'all can give us a thumbs up wait a minute we didn't try what the chili buy itself really really okay she's still at it some kind of way sorry like i said different taste buds wow wow with that right there i'm definitely signing out", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "w-0gupR02Tg": "hey guys and welcome to mixing with the lab manager so today we're going to be making a watermelon lemonade and now this is one of the recipes that I did at our last DIY night this is a really easy recipe easy as four basic starters to start and let me show you how what we're going to be using so we will be using F a watermelon flavor art watermelon as the first main flavor of this and it will be my primary and secondary flavor this gives the nice taste of the flesh of the watermelon not too much rind and the percentage that we will be using this at is 4% now at 4% we're going to get a nice fleshy nice bright red watermelon flavor that's kind of like a thick ready-to-go ripened watermelon straight from summer the second concentrate that we will be using is Slav aura lemonade now this is a really really nice base but it also doubles as sort of a primary it's got a really nice almost icy pole flavor to it and this is really really detrimental to the lemonade basis that we've got around this water on because basically what we're going for here is kind of a juiced watermelon lemonade drink we are going to use at 5% because it will give us a really nice lemonade kind of Tang just like an icy pole gonna have nice vibrant notes of watermelon but it's also going to come through with a really nice back-end note of the actual lemonade and we're also going to be using an enhancer we will be using capella super sweet at 0.5% it does exactly what it says it makes things super sweet it's fantastic along with that we're going to be doing a mix of 70/30 70 percent VG and 30 percent PG now today we'll be mixing with scales I do have all of the measurements right here but the percentage that we will be using in this bottle in total is 70 percent VG twenty point five percent PG so we're still going to keep it to that thirty percent PG and 70 percent VG ratio now I've got a little 30ml bottle in here and that means that our concentrate is going to just take up a little bit at the bottom and I think it's time that we get mixing first things first I'm going to turn on my scale wait until it zeros off and that's when it shows all the zeros and then I'm going to place my bottle on these scales now with this bottle is says 6.15 grams I'm going to press tare and that's going to clear the scales once your tat scales have been Ted and they're reading at zero we're going to go ahead and pick up our first concentrate which is floral lemonade now this is going in at floor for a lemonade at five percent which is one point five four grams and that is done now we are going to move over to flavor art watermelon now flavor art watermelon we will be putting in at four percent which is one point two four grams on the scale so we're just going to write here retail our scale so they read zero pick up our beautiful bottle of flavor art watermelon fantastic smell or at four percent which is one point two four grams and there we go now we've finished putting in flavor art watermelon now I tend to after the first to concentrate mixed in especially then being main flavors before the enhances in I'm just gonna pick that up I know that my mix is right and I'm gonna give it a little bit of a spin so it has a little bit of a mix not totally necessary to do before the pg/vg but I personally like to do it because it speeds things up let's retell that and then we're going to grab our enhancer now capella super sweet is our enhancer we will be using that at 0.5 percent which is 0.15 grams on the scales now this you need a steady hand for don't bump it too much because you can tend to overuse sweetener a little bit if you do put a little bit too much in because you can put too much in and we're going to be putting this at once again 0.15 steady hand steady as she goes and she's done perfect now once this is done we are going to move on to our PG now we're going to move on to the PG which is twenty point five percent which is six point three three grams so we're going to turn our scales on that tare mode get those zeros happening again and put in six point three three grams and now it's time for the VG but just before that we have put our PG in now that we've got a little bit more of a base give it a little bit more of a shake and then we'll add our little PG in there now straight back onto the scales reat air once more VG this is our biggest component to this juice it is coming in at 70% T 6.45 grams so taking a little top off of this and fill it up finish it off with the last little bits perfect off off closing little lid straight on with cap now I'm calling this one watermelon aid what a great name give it a good shake remember when you're shaking good wrist motion make sure that you get the oxygen rolling in there because you want to see all those tiny little bubbles and she is ready to go she is ready to go now this will have a steeping time of between one two three days but it is pretty much just a shake and bake so you can shake this and vape it straight away it is a nice little lemonade actually you know let's give it a try really front notes of watermelon and they're staying just about on the same line with the lemonade and it's coming through nice and sweet so we've done well really easy basic juice to do that's still gonna get your juices running I hope you guys like this looking forward

just starts to disintegrate and you start eating the cardboard stick you won't do the cut with this because it's plastic mmm so we had three of the red ones and I'm guessing that they're all the same flavor take these two Maria we're gonna try the yellow one and I'm going to do my very best to not have it fold in on itself although I don't really understand how I'm supposed to roll it so we'll figure that out together so here oh that one came off it smells the same and then I roll it up like this it'll just be a blob here so do I just go like this maybe oh maybe this maybe this one's not as

predominantly watermelon vape I know it's a very very mild sour note on the back end there's something with that watermelon that I'm not understanding good rape vapor production no throat hit after after the first couple of Apes you do get the sour but not as much as I'd like but the watermelon flavoring tastes exactly like a watermelon Jolly Rancher they said previous and for me that this one for some reason the flavor is a little bit muted like I wish there was more flavor in this e-liquid but I'm not getting it I wish there was a little bit more flavoring other than that it's a very mild watermelon sours it's a watermelon a juice but not so much on the sour and not so much on the flavor which is weird because the strawberry one was real good so one last hit and I'll let you guys go

and now it was summer coming and the fruit season coming along I wanted to share with you some of my favorite candy when this comes out of the dehydrator is going to be like a cross between taffy and cotton candy this is so delicious now everyone slices about this then watermelon is interesting it has in the seeds a the seeds have a substance that make them kind of a diuretic which means that if you eat the seeds along with the rest of the melon that would keep your body from unnaturally retaining too much water if you get this too thin then it gets to be too hard to get off of the sheets so you want probably those thickness if it gets too thin in it it doesn't dry up as well as it could and it's kind of sticky so you don't want too thick and you don't want it too thin and depending on the type of fruit and how much moisture is in it and the thickness of it the length of time is going to vary here's a thin one that has stuck on to it but even that comes pretty good normally they don't come off that easily I'm going to turn these over see if maybe that'll quicken their drying time now this one is at a really good stage I like the stage that this one is in you can tell that it's drying a little bit leathering this one is still too moist see how it kind of springs back up there's still a lot of wet pockets in there so that's going to need more time this one is still wet inside you can see so I'm going to put them back probably by this evening or maybe tomorrow they should be done this is how they look after about a day and a half of drying there perfect the worst part about them is they don't last very long and are so good it's like caramel candy taffy cotton-candy all mixed together this is some of the best candy you could get ahold of as a whole food tastes great it's going to be hard to save some for John when it gets home from work I can do three very true you you", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least

corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "MXYyFN2FNH4": "hi I'm Cassidy and that isn't

you see it okay um the video but keep watching our videos", "ehsJ_1YyNnQ": "what's happening guys it's Mike here with growing doors 365 this is going to be a super quick video I just wanted to talk about something this is what I got I got some watermelon here I'm going to be returning this Warner now and actually I want to hear it down below have you ever returned a watermelon that you opened this is a crazy thing but basically I'm really not into GMOs okay if you can if you could tell me something else and something different than what I'm about to say please do in the comments have you ever seen a watermelon after you've opened it up and it looks like this I've actually just I took a piece off right here just to kind of try it and see what it tasted like have you opened a watermelon and you've seen it look like this let me actually just guess I got to make it brighter I'm not sure but basically you can see exactly what I'm talking about okay it looks like that guess why that happens okay do you know yet okay if you don't know let me tell you real quick I'm this is just it's just so unnatural when I open something like this up just doesn't look right okay after doing some minor research I realized after reading some things all the way in Asia the Easter apparently they still use it because the EPA calls it non carcinogen I'm not sure if it's banned in the u.s. I didn't do full research on it but before I bagged this up and returned it to the store tomorrow I just wanted to do a quick video and make other people realize if you don't know and if you've seen it like this do not eat this watermelon okay it is super super genetically modified okay it's full of a certain type of I guess fertilizers now I'm not sure if it has something to do with the pesticides obviously some it's not an organic watermelon okay so there was probably pesticides number two whatever was used to fertilize it whatever was used to feed the actual plant to produce this delicious luscious beautiful watermelon it did this to the inside and what it does what it did was basically it made it grow too fast for its own body and it creates that crack inside this is one of the biggest tell tales of how do you know that a watermelon has been said some funky stuff that just it's a hormone okay that's basically what it is it's a hormone that it was fed to to create to make it grow as fast as possible probably to meet market demand at the summer you know closes in people are enjoying watermelons right now they might not be soon but this is what some farmers might do they you know to increase size and weight and production and so forth so when you have a little watermelon they jack it up and they make it a little bigger watermelon really fast by feeding it hormones and this is what happens you know imagine it's like pretty small as it develops develops the inside can't keep up with the development because it's supposed to be going a little slower and it's smaller but that the hormone just made it to go too fast and it cracks like that inside if you open it up a watermelon just like that do not eat it just it just made me think I was like man what can cause something to do that you know and I'm just I'm just so not into GMO produce I mean obviously nobody is give me the thumbs-up if you're not into GMOs hopefully all the thousands of subscribers you're not into GMOs also I read that you know another another tell sign is a lot of white seeds it's obviously we're supposed to have more black seeds black seeds develop as the watermelon develops also in the watermelon I'm seeing a lot of the white seeds I literally just got this I've been taking down I've been eating like a watermelon every like every four days okay I love to just cut them down and take one I put it in my Tupperware I take another put in another Tupperware and morning at night whenever it's delicious it's incredible for the digestive system I love watermelon I'm actually gone 200 percent now going to be committed to growing my own indoor watermelon pesticide free and with good old nutrients that I could you know come out with so anyway again I just wanted to show you guys this before I bag it up I thought it's really important for people to know especially people that are in certain climates that only seem Porter Mellon time to time I mean obviously we you know you get watermelon you know all the times most of the time because they get imported from wherever but in the summer times we see a lot of watermelon or in our local supermarkets and if you see that do not eat it return it to the store and say hey I'm just not happy with it I did you know I'm not into these type of watermelons I don't know why there's a crack whatever say something that's what I'm doing

[Laughter]", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "6C2h1f6cfIk": "hi and welcome to 365 fitness tips I'm Marty Kate today's topic is watermelon yes and it turns out watermelon has some great little benefits just like that little blue pill you know we're talking about leopard upper it's caught by a Gras so there was a recent study done and we're about to get into that so stick around so you can see what it's about ding ding ding ding ding you don't have to take Viagra you can just eat craploads watermelon now so there was a study done in Illinois's by this grandiose doctor here and he found out that it helps to daily connect fishes so you don't have to be taking the blue pill all the side effects you can just sit around all day and eat watermelon yes yes yes yes yes slice it up dice it up however you want it but you want to make sure you get in a daily if not weekly supply of good old watermelon to increase the benefits in the bedroom so here are some of the nutritional benefits it's an excellent source of lycopene which helps reduce colon prostate breast endometrial and lung cancer hi and citrulline an amino acid that helps relax blood vessels much like viagra without all the side effects and it also helps eliminate free radicals that can oxidize cholesterol and increase inflammation so watermelon is really one of those cool fruits that you should just be eating just because it is pink in nature with the little white wine and the the dark green and it turns out you can eat all the way down to the rind cuz I Ryan really has some good nutritional value on it as well too I have to do another you know showing that to tell you what that's all about but definitely aunt watermelon cific grocery less want it like that and one of the great ways that you can tell if a watermelon is really ripe sometimes you get them too early you think because they're small they're really good those are bad ones to get cuz they're really not sweet you want to make sure when you get a watermelon that you have little yellow spot the yellow spot tells you that it's been laying in the patch and so it's been ripening so really that's an indicator that you really got to get watermelons so as always I want you to eat healthy yes I want you to exercise daily yes and I want you to enjoy your body and I also want you to become fit and empower with me Marty Kay because if you eat healthy the exercise day and you enjoying your body would just come you know I've been listening at this guy called Jeff Olson is a slight edge and if you just do those things incrementally every day like at every meal make sure you're eating something healthy every day make sure you get in 10 to 15 minutes of some sort of exercise you will benefit exponentially in the long run by", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "neOErb5QOck": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the sour patch kids a lollipop with sour candy dipping powder there are 25 individually wrapped packs in here it says each pack includes lollipop and dip these were 3.99 at target and honestly i saw them there and i would not have thought a thing about them but ashley our daughter is absolutely crazy about anything sauerkraut and she is very very familiar um these are all raspberries she is very very familiar with uh the what they offer from sour patch and she said i've never seen anything like that before and so she bought and some for her uh i think to give away to her kids at school and uh or to eat maybe to eat because when you go into her house her uh her place she has a ball like welcomes you when you go in the door and in that bowl is all kinds of different sour patch things bags and and she just loves stuff like that and so when i told her i said well i'm gonna buy she bought a bag i said i'm gonna buy a bag and uh because she really wanted two bags uh to have enough for all the kids and i said i'll buy a bag and we'll review them and i said then i'll give you the rest of the bag so that's what we're doing um this has pink raspberry and it has red berry there are it says one pack 25 servings per container one pack 15 grams is 60 calories so 60 calories for each of these if you eat the whole thing um includes lollipop and dip so this is like um a different dipping stick is that what it's called or which and you could you have a place on the back to put two in from um i've got the red there you go okay so so you get the the pop and it's shaped like one of those children around the front with the hair it's already got powder all over it [Music] i like the red berry flavor i don't really get sour from them made in mexico okay okay now all the powder in the bottom is white so and you get a little tartness from it but it's not a lot it looks like it's got hair oh i can dip his whole head and make maggie mustard hazel yeah that has white hair that is actually really really good no it's not bad i get a little bit of sourness to it but but not much it um frosted the frosted tips um a little bit of sourness but um it has a really nice flavor for me personally i would much rather just buy this in a candy form than buy it on the stick yeah i'd rather have like a gummy or oh it has his face on there too oh see i was looking i was looking well i thought it was just the shape of his head i was looking at the back of his head the whole time and i turned him around he actually has eyes and a snake it looks like a tiki uh a tiki face yeah liking gilligan's alan yeah um okay these are pink raspberry i like the flavor of that one's a little stronger oh that's really good i like that one better i mean it looks good this one seems to be stronger it's really nice raspberry um oftentimes when we try candies i'll compare i'll say these remind me of something else whether these remind me of a lifesaver starburst jolly rancher these don't remind me of any of those these are in a category the flavor the flavor is in a category all on its own these are very distinct sour patch kid flavors that don't remind me of other candies do they you no but i'd still would rather have just the gummies the gummy candies oh i would too the sucker is just more to deal with you got to have the stick you could take somebody and you when you grab a gummy and just stick your mouth and start chewing well or um if if sour patch kid made these in like little hard candies i would totally well i mean they they would that that would be something really cool um for me i'm not going to eat it and we've said this about other things about dum dum suckers that we've got i wish they sold these in hard candy because they sell some really good good flavors um but a stick is is not something that i'm going to walk around i mean these are great for kids i think kids will love them adults will love them too if you don't mind eating suckers i would just rather not have a sucker right i would think ashley will eat a couple of these but i'd say she'll be sure because ashley's not i don't i can't imagine actually sitting around on the couch eating these i just can't but you don't know so uh but they're out there they were new to her and so i don't know if it's a new thing or not uh but i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "IKbCbUcvZxc": "hello and welcome to my cooking show for today I'll be showing you how to make your own homemade Zahle pops these are fun and easy to make and they're really good okay now let's get on to the story all right so the ingredients that you'll need are sugar Cointreau blue Jolly Ranchers red green and purple and also you will need four appliances lollipop sticks and silicone molds the first step you will need to do and to make these is we need to crush up all of your power Jolly Ranchers except for purple this is because you will need those later on for your dark background then you put your different color matches into your molds separately randomize them for different and cool colors then you want to pre-heat your oven to 275 and then you want to put the Jolly Rancher molds in for 15 to 18 minutes and then when you take out let them cool after these have cooled you want to set these aside and go get your sugar and your corn syrup for this next step you will need a bowl to put your mixture in boil your mixture you will need one and a half cups of sugar 3/4 cups of chords are [Music] and 1/2 cup of water and then you will need to mix it around till it's a big mush and it looks sort of a brown color now you want to boiler your mixture until you get to 300 degrees Fahrenheit stir frequently for good texture and smooth surface for your lollipops now with your mixture you pour some and take each of them home that you'll be using so fold them up next crush your grape Jolly Ranchers do you have a a nice big shake now put the pieces of your grape Jolly Rancher into the molds as you had done you earlier make sure it's good and tight

try sour patch kids lollipops we have two flavors pink raspberry and red berry you see it comes as a lollipop and a dip now i'm not going to try both of them because that would really mess my teeth up so i think i'm going to go with pink raspberry okay so includes a lollipop and dip i think it's kind of like fun dip okay this is gonna be really hard to open apparently there we go hope the dip doesn't get everywhere so i really like sour patch kids i'm sure these are going to be pretty awesome so let's see yeah that's really good basically just tastes like a sour patch kid got turned into a jolly rancher um yeah if you know what sour patch kids taste like this is pretty much you know what you're getting if you know what sour patch kids taste like this tastes exactly the same except it's a lollipop it's got the um sour candy dipping powder when i saw these on the internet i figured these were going to be really good i think most everybody really likes sour patch kids except if you don't like sour candy yeah it's pretty sour you just taste it let me just try it without the sour on it without the sour dip on it yeah that's really good i really like these a lot out of all the things i've tasted so far in the show except for maybe the detroit style pizza this is probably the best thing i've tried i know traditionally for valentine's day you want to get your you want to get your partner chocolates but i think these would be really good for for valentine's day i actually have a big pack of them that's how i was able to get them the packages the packages the package has hearts on it so i presume that they made these for valentine's day since they're putting out valentine's day candy now valentine's day comes sooner every single year like christmas and halloween but the thing about halloween and valentine's day is the candy's not going to keep for very long i guess everybody wants to try it wants to try the candy wants to have it for a while yeah i'm sure the red berry tastes great too i mean again this isn't one of those things where it's like sour patch kids sometimes are good they're good all the time um you have you know like sour patch kids you have the sour patch watermelon these are really really really good i would be thrilled if i got these for valentine's day and if your partner likes sour candy too they probably would love these for valentine's day they might not even know these are out but i got them on amazon i'm sure you can get them at target walmart whatever yeah these are awesome anyway as always thank you so much for watching have a safe and fun valentine's day and please like always likes and subscribes are always appreciated thank you so much see you next time", "QH3sASz3_AY": "[JEFF]: Hi. \nI'm the beard behind the bar and today we're taking it tropical. There's nothing \nlike sitting on a beach with a delicious drink in your hand. Mai Tais, Pi\u00f1a Coladas, and Daiquiris, all instantly put you\nin a vacation state of mind. So, what do you do \nif you can't get to an island? You make a summery sipper \nthat packs a punch at home. Mini melons are not the only\nthe main ingredient for this drink, they're also perfect \nfor serving the drink. Start by scooping out the mini melon, and putting the watermelon \ninto a blender to puree it. Then add 2.5 oz. of Appleton rum. 2 oz. of guava juice. Squeeze one half of a lime \ninto the blender. That's about 3/4 of an ounce of juice. Add a 1/2 ounce of simple syrup. And, then the final ingredient \nis an ounce of Aperol. Aperol is having a little bit \nof a moment right now. It's an aperitif that combines \norange and mandarin orange flavors with a nice balance \nbetween bitter and sweet. And, add a little ice. Blend that all up\nand pour it right back into your melon halves. Add an umbrella \nand a couple straws to share. And, boom! You're on an island\nwithout ever leaving home.

thumbnail you realize we're going to be doing some hammering some cutting in dissecting of candy and this candy is we actually did a video this that I didn't eat it I didn't do anything in the video but there's been a ton of comments there on that video so it's time to finally get some more and break them open because I want to see what's inside this candy so I bought a little screwdriver set because I'm going to use those as a chisel and then there's four kinds here in regards to flavors but only to bugs we have the Scorpion and the worm and unique flavors here what do we got banana tequila blueberry and strawberry so I'm going to open up one of these first so these kilo one and then probably not all of these but one of these maybe the banana let's just look to see where the bugs are placed how's that this one here is right near the edge so I should be able to break through this pretty easy now the scorpion that's a nice big scorpion and the blue one this one here seems a little disheveled and then this one's pretty nice too mmm I might want to break open a disheveled one but we'll decide I hope you're prepared I guess people have headphones on so I'll be doing some hammering as you can tell I should need to warn you that it's not a normal video it's a little sticky it's gonna be a messy video obviously almost out okay let's take a good close look at that it's gonna be hard on the brown kind of blends in so he's right at the edge so I should be able to chip away enough to get in here I'm going to use one of my finer little screwdrivers and just chip away a section here let me try this flavor okay so I rounded out right by Oh super sticky that's your different shot but sticking to my teeth I'm trying to isolate it or her or it whatever this bug is the stickiness I realize how sticky was gonna be Wow now I need to come down this way we're just getting right into this whoo look at him he's somewhat mushy he broke a little bit there be a little more careful well little bug pieces just fell out I think for the most part most of them is intact there's the front some kind of bugs spine in there is it a rope he just broke he's so brittle I thought we had a tact worm close it was a close dissection you get another little tool in here and see if I can take my worm apart it's very dry the worm it sure does look like a real bug I hope you're running well there's no way that's a real bug well this piece looks challenging to eat it had a very well I've never had bugs before but I'm thinking that I just ate a bug the flavor on this not too strong this hmm interesting I'm not sure I'll do that again it does look like a crystal or a piece of glass doesn't it when I break it now it just tasted like sugar really there's no it's hard to die dissect digest I mean to pick out different flavors when you're biting a chunk of sugar um but it did have some kind of I guess bug flavor to it like the dryness of that hmm kind of piece stuck in my throat let's check out this guy here let's move this worm yes this is gonna be one of those videos that will go down in Lucky Penny shop history bug pieces everywhere strange dissections but you know that's what everybody wants to see so I'm just going on with what everybody wants to see they wanted to see me eat it they wanted to see the inside okay this one's gonna be much harder I think if I break off half it's very chewy that's better last Oh strawberry flavor much better than tequila work on my hair I'm not this one I'm try everybody I don't want to use we broke his front piece off see here look on this side I took that candy out of my mouth because it's very wants to stick to my teeth let's keep going I want to get to the body and we're working our way in oh look I put a little hole in my cutting boards oh man all the name of dissection I guess oh we got some of the body exposed hold on see it there let's get in it looks like this is just gonna be one of those cool look his leg came off right there see it's exposed now and here we go getting closer there's another body piece now here we go I'm going right into the main body chunk look at that it almost got them fully exposed now I'll hold this here and split them right in half oh there we are we are in come on bug show yourself it's okay don't be afraid I'm not gonna eat you oh there we go there's for sure bug pieces here now this is not as easily to get out as the UM the worm who would eat this now let's go let's hear it in the comments oh now you're all gonna think I'm crazy here okay I think that's pretty much the main piece this is just not a normal video Oh something saying eat it but then something saying don't eat it there maybe I should reconstitute this in a little water a little warm water let me do that I'll be right back I'm gonna get some water all right here we go I got some water you know when I started this video I never thought I'd get to this point I never have any real plan these are like a forceps that I found in a collection of tools that I had and it's warm water so I'm hoping it just melts off the the sugar which it is let's put too much pressure let me just let it sit in there basically almost hot water yep that there is a bug and the forceps are or if I call them forceps let's see now most of that is melted off yep that's some kind of bug matter well I don't know what I've resolved here this one's really tasty that's for sure what I eat the whole thing that's a good question I got bug skin everywhere what a mess uh I'll leave it in the comments eat it yes or no and what did we solve hmm it's gonna think about that well maybe I'll leave it in the comments and then uh if you want to see the other video we'll have a link there and I just show it I don't even open it touch it lick it nothing and that's about it if you want to see other candy dissections we recently did a giant jawbreaker smash that was fun lot different in this one this one's a little sounds a

like this please give this video a big thumbs up I would love that step one is to combine 1/2 a cup of sugar with a quarter cup of light corn syrup for this particular recipe I recommend that or Lyle's golden syrups only step two is to give it a stir it will be crazy thick but that's what you want step three is to cook your candy in two minute increments and you can find the recipe link in my description box there are two very important facets to consider when creating this candy and number one is to be very careful the sugar syrup will get very hot so you don't want to walk away from it you want to keep your eye on it and number two is a very important factor as well probably the most important and is that you want your candy to reach 300 degree Fahrenheit this way your finished product isn't too brittle or too soft and gooey and that it's just right but beyond that you can really have fun and have creative Liberty and inject in some edible glitter or whatever your heart desires step 4 is to pour and decorate and I'll link in my description box the lollipop sticks amusing I hope you guys enjoyed this video there are a ton more DIYs coming at you this month between

a few ingredients you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar 2/3 cup of corn syrup and 3/4 cup of water you're also going to need some kind of flavour I'm going to do cinnamon and then yours you want food coloring then you're going to need food coloring so let's get started first you're just going to need a pot this is a small batch so here is my pot I want to go ahead and put in my 2 cups of sugar 2/3 of corn syrup you're not going to get all that out so just do the best you can and then I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on medium-high then you're gonna add your water and you want to stir that up I put it on medium-high for a few minutes so this sugar can start to meal you just want to mix that up all we do now is wait just a few minutes and let that melt just a little bit get warm and I'm gonna turn it up to high heat and insert my candy thermometer okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and turn it up on high and you're gonna need a candy thermometer and when you put it in the pot you don't want the bottom to touch you just want it down in the sugar mixture and what we want to do you don't want to stir it you want it to get up to at the end it's going to get up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit but at 260 you're gonna add your food coloring if you want to add food coloring I'm going to add some red food coloring since I'm doing cinnamon and want to put in maybe three or four drops of that and you don't stir it up you just let it do its thing it's going to be a rolling ball and I'll show you when we get there okay while we're waiting on the sugar to bowl to get to temp I'm going to put sticks in my lollipop molds and this is the only part that I'll let mommy help me with because this is very dangerous that sugar gets up to 300 degrees and what little bit I got on my hand the other day you know it doesn't feel good so this is the only part that I will let her do because I do not want her to get burnt I don't know how many it's gonna take this candy mold works good except the the cut out part where the stick goes it's just not quite deep enough and whenever I put the sugar in there I have to turn the stick a little bit so it gets coated but that's okay that background noise is not chocolate tempering machines and they are noisy so sorry for the noise the sugar is starting to bowl so we got to wait for this to get up to 260 it's up to 200 right now and that is hot so when it gets to 260 I will put my food cart in and right back okay the mixture is about to 260 and I'm going to go ahead and put some food coloring in here and be careful it will steam do not stir it up it will mix around and then when it's done balling when it has gotten up to 300 you're gonna add the food care line and mix it up so it's gonna stir it up anyway almost 280 right now wrap for 300 just win put in this flavor right up to 295 so I'm gonna get ready and add the food coloring or shake the flavor all right open up my cinnamon hall take out the thermometer and shake it a little bit that's a pretty read or in the OL during it and be careful this is really hot it's pretty now I'm going to turn you around - all right I'm bad - pour too much it's hard to tell too much strong never done cinnamon I've just been doing fruit flavors would see that's what happens I can salvage that one on that before in his notes to me here too much the whole gram in there woof stick I didn't step to hurry times already starting to some of those need some more my toast cool and then I'll show you what they look like that is so strong my eyes are burning [Music] background on man and put it on there and just break it up into pieces [Music] I might pull that into little pieces for Billy but what I do next maybe insane I just have to put water back in the pot to clean it and put it back on stage to bowl get it from the old miser Burton and let it melt roll it that waste not some heart you consider oh and then there's some places that I can't get out hard to pizza water is really hot and let it melt too but this is what I do I might call it in two pieces but really because he said he wanted to summon some wax to make them just to put these it I don't know if they like school night spots Oh I cut it into pieces I'm not gonna do it perfect over there just getting old which is not always a perfect at all it's not for anybody been really hard it's so strong he's very emotional but since it's for really I don't care what it looks like [Music] just don't care my eyes nose still burnin so what I'm gonna do when that calls I'm just gonna wrap it up and wax paper for Billy to put in his pocket this is boring so I want to get that clean they're gonna have to clean the side on the sink so we're still waiting on these to cool they might be a couple here we go simple lollipops these are cinnamon and when you purchase in when you you cinnamon be sure to have a good ventilation I do not have that in here so there you go that's how to make hard candy most of it still shiny and we'll let it cool but I hope you enjoyed this video and got a good laugh of me coughing and hacking I hope you guys have a great day and stay tuned for more candy videos [Music]", "A6-ApxPabg8": "hello I'm

gonna be reviewing Cowboy Bebop Oh a classic anime from the 90s back when the aunt what Oh or not okay let them what are we reviewing Oh oh sweet aunt jemima alright well this is something called a scorpion pop and it happens coming a blueberry flavor of course because when you're actually eating a scorpion you don't want that tricky poison to come kill you that would be now you don't want to taste the poison this is the first time I've ever actually had to put my life in danger for a can you review I don't know how active the stinger is or if I'm gonna have some sort of allergic reaction to this thing but I do it all for you I do it all for the people this is from a company called hot licks and they're notorious for making all sorts of weird candy infused treats I mean from chocolate-covered maggots to barbeque crickets yes barbecue crickets they don't seem to have a filter as to where to stop so alright I'm kind of afraid of eating this thing one thing I should note is that it's really heavy like I don't know what this scorpion ate before he died was really weighing this thing down alright well let's go ahead and crack this bad boy in half oh boy there it is and then it looks a lot more terrifying and light than it did in the packaging actually this reminds me of this old SAP candy I used to get back in the pic back in the 90s basically what they would do is they would take the sap from trees which I know comes naturally and just court of occasion and sell it it was like maple honey this is like maple death alright here we go now let's go ahead and okay let's go ahead and now let's go ahead and say good take a dirt oh why is it so crunchy why does it taste like I'm eating a giant cheeto oh okay this is the one thing I truly regret eating at the same time I don't regret eating because for one thing the blueberry flavor sort of tastes like cotton candy surprising that's for one thing but the Scorpion it tastes like a toenail clipping that's been sitting on your desk for the past two weeks if I had to compare it to something scary well you know that big ball of foil that sits in the back your fridge you know the one your parents ain't never ever to touch yeah well I imagine that's exactly what this tastes like oh man what have I done what have I become two papayas out of six", "maO2R4jmnYM": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make a super simple strawberry lollipop now I know a lot of people get really nervous or scared or think oh my gosh I'll Ollie pop how do you even make that and I know when I started making lollipops I was nervous to be handling molten-hot sugar but I promise it's really really easy it's so simple and as soon as you learn how to make a really basic lollipop you're gonna be hooked okay so the first thing you need to know about lollipops is everything all the ingredients get measured out so right here you can't really see it but I've got my measuring my food scale and what I'm gonna do is take my pot and set it on the scale and turn it on and that's going to bring it to zero so then what I'm gonna do is put my ingredients directly into the pot so the first ingredient in lollipops is glucose or corn syrup now when I'm making lollipops at the shop at Fiddlesticks I don't use corn syrup we use a non-gmo glucose that does not contain corn so we're not using corn syrup but this is the easiest thing to find if you're looking for your ingredients at the grocery store or at a craft store you might find glucose that's in a little tub but today we're going to use corn syrup and so what we're gonna do is pour this corn syrup directly in the pot and we are looking for 200 grams of corn syrup or glucose so I'm just watching it go up okay so we've got 200 grams of glucose or corn syrup in the pot so we're gonna tear this back to zero and then our next ingredient that's going in is pure cane sugar and so we're gonna put in 300 grams of sugar on top of our glucose so that's 300 grams and then the last ingredient in our lollipops is just water so I'm going to do 112 grams of water onto this so the key with the water is to pour it in really carefully so it doesn't splash your ingredients your sugar anywhere as long as you don't get sugar granules splashed up onto the side you're good to go you don't have to touch this again so what we're gonna do is move this on to a cooktop and turn on the heat and let it go okay so we've got our ingredients onto the cooktop I'm turning this on and so we're just gonna let this go we're gonna let it come to a boil you do not stir lollipop syrup so at this point everything is meshing well we're just gonna leave it alone that's probably the hardest part and also the easiest part of making lollipops just don't touch it I know it's so tempting to stir it so once this comes to a boil normally I would put in my candy thermometer but today I forgot my candy thermometer at the Fiddlesticks candy kitchen you don't have a candy thermometer hanging around you might have one of these this is a thermal thermometer it's one of those things that you can like point at the wall and see what the temperature is so this works for candy as well so you can just point it right at your syrup and it's gonna tell you what the temperature is so that's really important when making lollipops because you're going to want your lollipop syrup to come to 305 degrees or about 310 so on your candy thermometer typically it'll show you the hard crack temperature and that's what you really want when you're making Molly pops so once this comes to a boil if you've got a candy thermometer you're gonna put it in there because everything will be bubbling up nice and beautiful so while this is boiling I wanted to share with you how we're going to add our strawberry flavor into the lollipop syrup so you basically have three options my personal favorite way to flavor lollipops is using a really good Jam from a local jam maker so if you've got somebody in your town that makes really super yummy Jam go to them first because their flavor is going to turn up in your lollipop the best now if you don't have that handy like I don't today your next best bet is to use a flavor emulsion this can be found in the baking section of any craft store you'll see on the front it says bakery emulsion this is a Lorien gourmet brand now your third option if you don't have a an emulsion handy or you don't want to use an emulsion your last option is to use these tiny little candy oils it's from the same company Lauren and it's just a strawberry flavor oil so the biggest difference with the oil versus the jam or the emulsion is when you're going to add it to your lollipop syrup so if you're using a jam or any mole j'en you're gonna watch the temperature on your lollipop syrup and when it gets to 290 degrees that's when you're gonna add your flavoring in if you're using the oil like this you're gonna wait till it comes to the hard crack stage about 305 degrees or so and you're gonna pull it from the heat and then you're gonna add in your oil so the reason we do that is because the emulsion and the jam has some extra water that's gonna need to cook off whereas the oil doesn't okay so while our lollipop syrup is boiling remember we're not touching it we're gonna go ahead and prep our lollipop molds so you can find molds at any local craft store sometimes they'll be silicone like this one that's my favorite or sometimes they'll be those white plastic molds either way it'll work no big deal but if you've got a plastic mold you're gonna have to spray a little bit of nonstick cooking spray on it if you're using silicone it'll pop out really nice and easy no big deal so what I like to do is take a small baking sheet about this size and I put my lollipop mold on top of it because when we're pouring our lollipop syrup into the molds we're going to want to fit to get all the bubbles out and the easiest way to do that with these silicone molds is to have a baking sheet underneath so we're pretty much ready if we were gonna put any sprinkles in our lollipops we might put some sprinkles in now before we start pouring and then otherwise all we have to do is put our sticks in so we're going to prep our sticks into our molds and I put the top of the stick about halfway into the middle of the lollipop shape and we're just using a basic 2-inch lollipop today so that's it we're ready so as soon as that syrup is done boiling we can go ahead and start pouring our strawberry lollipops into the molds oh one last thing so one last tool that you're going to need for pouring your lollipops is a good glass measuring cup with a handle and a pour spout this makes it really easy to pour your lollipops and also reheat the syrup if it starts to get cooled down too quickly so make sure you have one of these handy and a little spatula would be super handy as well alright so our lollipop syrup just came off of the stovetop so it's still bubbling I'm gonna go ahead and pour in my oil my flavoring oil and you've got to be careful when you do this because sometimes it lets off a bit of steam and you can see it rising or you might be able to and some fumes with it so kind of keep your face away and I'm just stirring it in remember we didn't stir anything up until now don't stir the syrup until you add in the flavor so I'm just gonna stir it and let this steam roll off and keep going until all the bubbling stops alright so our lollipop syrups stopped bubbling all of the flavors mixed in really well now I want you to remember this is molten sugar it is so hot it looks really not scary but it is really hot believe me trust me I've accidentally burnt myself several times with a lollipop syrup and it hurts it is over 300 degrees so it's basically like sticking your hand in an oven that's liquid so just be careful don't let your kids do this part we're gonna be super careful but we're going to transfer the syrup the lollipop syrup from inside of this pot into our really helpful pouring measuring cups so we're going to do that now so here's the thing about lollipop syrup it's sticky it's sugar it's gonna make all these little strings it's gonna be messy you've just got to embrace the mess I feel like that's good life advice in general just embrace the mess just go with it you're gonna make a mess but it's actually surprisingly easy to clean up and as long as you take your empty pot and put it right into the sink with some water on it it'll actually be really simple to wash out as long as you get water on it before it starts to harden okay so at this point if you were gonna add any coloring to your lollipop syrup you're gonna want to do it right now I'm not planning to add any extra coloring I just kind of like it when it's the natural color but it's fun to play with color too so if you're gonna add color you want to use gel food coloring not regular food coloring because it's water-based gel food coloring will mix in better you only need a teeny tiny bit a little bit goes a long way with the color and the lollipop syrup so you would add that now mix it up with a small spatula or a little popsicle stick would work really well but for us we're ready to pour our super simple strawberry lollipop so we've got our mold we've got our sticks in there we've got our syrup here we're just gonna start pouring I like to use a spatula to kind of balance my my measuring cup and we're just going to pour very carefully into each mold let the syrup come up over the top of the lollipop that's where this tree three okay and then do a few taps to make sure that all the air bubbles come out okay so our strawberry lollipops we let them sit for about thirty minutes they're totally cool so if we touch them they're definitely cold cool and so now it's just time to take them out of the mold it's one of my favorite parts so all we do is gently lift and pull them out of the mold and you have yourself a lollipop now you could get really fun and creative and maybe put on a little freeze-dried lollipop on top of this to give it a I'm sorry a freeze-dried strawberry on top to kind of let your guests know it's a strawberry you could add all sorts of sprinkles or colors or anything but this is just your basic strawberry lollipop remember if you used Jam or even the emulsion typically there is some color that would come through so you might have a little bit more pink or red definitely use jam it'll look way more like strawberry but there you go you've got your hard candy lollipops", "BmgZ-UlguNI": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm Vaughn chewy strawberry kills our countrymen will kill the Jeopardy raspberry Jolly Rancher triple bomb three in one volleyball", "dx3yct5Upc8": "[Music] you [Music] well that's nice that okay so the inhale is pretty one-dimensional it's probably the best way to describe it that what you do get is essentially watermelon now I'm not getting any type of candy with this it is essentially a watermelon with a very slight touch of sweetness flavor just going right over the tongue sweetness the very slight bit of sweetness I'm getting is just right in the middle of the mouth at the back what is nice about is is how fresh it is there's a slight floral note there and is a slight earthy note as well which it tastes like the rind of a watermelon that's probably the best way to kind of relate that to anything it's watermelon related but it's not something you generally associate with watermelon as an e liquid flavor after the inhale holding it in you do get more of that floral essence come through a lot more sweetness kind of works with the floral element here as well [Music] very subtle notes of the candy like base that I what I thought would be there on the in how it is on there after the inhale very light though doesn't really stick to anything which is really odd the watermelon is the forefront flavor here you've got the dash of sweetness just lingering around with that and then you just got that sweet candy sort of thing going on just underneath it really isn't binding anything at all but what is really important to this flavor is the sweetness that you do get it's it needs to be there this sweetness otherwise the watermelon will become very bland and it's borderline bland as it is watermelon really to me isn't a forefront flavor that should be used in any liquids it should be more of a undertone note which it's kind of been used in the wrong way here the watermelon is very potent it's a very strong flavor and it is the main flavor of the liquid it's watermelon slices so is what you saw and expect the exhale is very empty the watermelon flavors gone you're left with a very slight floral note which is very reminiscent of the the rind that I was on about earlier it's there's no sweetness the candy elements gone it's just not very nice that there's there's level issues with this juice balance problems it's just not vaping very nice at all overall there's problems with this it doesn't taste nasty but what you get is just something isn't balanced very well the flavors to me are too muted I'd like a lot more sweetness to be applied with this the floral notes the that rind sort of taste that I'm getting shouldn't be there this is a watermelon sliced it should be a lot more sweeter and it should be a lot more fresher within that sweetness the watermelon is just the watermelon and watermelon on its own generally doesn't beat very nicely it needs something else and it what it needs isn't here what it could what it should have isn't more I don't design e-liquid but if it was me I'd probably put some strawberry in with that or something it's just not very great it's one of them ones you could probably just fake and go well I'm glad there's only a 30ml bottle of that because you're not gonna be probably vaping it anymore I definitely won't be vaping it after this it's it's unusual it's very unusual so there you go guys that is watermelon slices from the tuckshop range by dinner lady done I hope you find informative make sure you like this video comment and subscribe thanks very much for watching guys I shall see you soon Cheers", "DxVx5My-Zkc": "hey guys welcome to taste of love i'm marine and today we are making jolly rancher candy grapes so before we get started go ahead and give this video a thumbs up click on the subscribe button and turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time a new video drops so let's go ahead and get started okay so here we have our supplies we have our cairo syrup white food coloring blue food coloring toothpicks jolly rancher grapes and a one cup measuring cup so before we get started we're going to prep our grapes our grapes have already been washed and dried they would drive using a paper towel and now we're going to insert the toothpicks into our grapes so that we can dip them in the candy now when it comes to dipping the toothpicks when it comes to putting the toothpicks into the grapes you can't put it where you remove the grape from the stem on this side you put it on the opposite side on the bottom so you run the toothpick through the bottom of the grate so that when you shake it and you dip it it won't fall off so we're going to insert our toothpicks into all of our grapes make sure you go through your bag of grapes really carefully because a lot of the time some of the grapes are rotten and they're deforming so you don't want to dip those grapes into candy so we're going to stick them all and then you want to put the toothpick not just a little bit in so that when you go like that it'll fall off but more all the way in so when you shake it because you would have to shake off that excess candy it wouldn't fall off [Music] and then you put it all the way in so that it's sturdy so that it really holds onto the grate you can use any other food color that you want also i'm using blue because i wanted mine to be blue and i'm going to flavor it with the blue jolly rancher candies also [Applause] but i'm going to show you guys that in one second so you also need your thermometer and a deep size pot because sometimes your candy batter does bubble up for this recipe we're doing the four one one method so we're using four cups of sugar 1 cup of carrot syrup and 1 cup of water now if you do put your toothpick all the way through and it comes through the top it doesn't matter because when you slip it out after you dip it in candy it'll still come easily out [Music] [Applause] okay so right now we're going to add our ingredients to the pot to make our candy batter so we're gonna add four cups of sugar [Music] one cup of water [Music] and our cairo syrup [Music] now i'm going to add a few drops of white food coloring [Music] and i'm also going to add the blue and just two drops of the blue now i'm going to start my stove and turn it up to 7.5 so that my candy batter can cook and we're going to leave our candy batter to cook until it gets to 300 degrees okay you see the the colors is getting all mixed up on its own this is why i don't mix it because i like when it gets mixed from cooking it gets a more even mixture then if you try to mix it up but that's just what i like so this is why i didn't mix it when i put the colors in [Music] [Music] all right our candy has finished cooking it's gotten to 300 degrees look at how pretty that blue is so we're gonna take our pot off of the hot stove and then we're gonna get ready to dip our grapes okay so i have my pot angled to the side it's leaning on the stove just so that the angle would be i guess kind of able to tilt all my batter down so that i can get it and what i have here is my food processor which i'm going to crush up my jolly ranchers with so i'm just going to drop some of the jolly ranchers into my food processor and crush them up real quick and the reason i wait for my candy to be done cooking while i do this is because i don't want my um my candy to my well not my candy not my candy batter but the jolly rancher candies to get sticky and stick together and then it's hard to use so i'm just going to drop them in here really quick and blend it up so i'm opening my blue candy first because what i'm going to do is take this blue candy and drop it into my candy batter so that it'll flavor it i'm just putting two of them in here the candy is hot [Music] so it will melt it [Music] so now i'm going to drop my jolly ranchers in here really quickly so we could just crush them up if you don't have a food processor you can put them in three ziploc bags i will triple bag it and then use a rolling pin and crush it [Music] that method has worked for me personally for a little while before i started putting it in the fruit processor the food processor just makes it more fine and more dusted than really chunky and i like it finer than more chunkier because if you ever ate candy grapes you know that when you put it in your matcha bite into it if it's really chunky it can like scratch the top of your mouth and it's really painful so i'm just putting all my candy in here [Music] and i don't really need a lot because we only did a little bit of grapes [Music] okay so i have all the jolly ranchers that i want in here now i am going to turn it on so we can crush these up [Music] there we go nice and fine now i'm going to take them and pour them out into a little bowl so that we can go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy mixture and add jolly ranchers to move this inside nice and crushed so now we're going to go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy okay so here's my grape i'm going to dip it into my candy shake it off and roll it into my genre and there we go that's how it's going to look here now let's dip all of them shake it off you don't want to exist and also i use a spoon to keep the jolly rancher constantly mixed you can use a fork so it doesn't really matter because if you let your jolly rancher sit still it will start pumping up and get hard [Music] and i would suggest putting them in the refrigerator immediately after dipping [Music] i do suggest putting your candy grapes in the refrigerator immediately after dipping because it does get sticky and it starts melting almost immediately candy grapes is one of the fruits that will melt really really fast like really really fast from the minute you dip the grapes into the candy it starts to melt because grapes are a water-based fruit so they don't last very long you can put your grapes in the freezer after you dip them to try to lengthen how long they last but it does not lengthen it by much maybe by just a couple hours and putting it in the freezer would not change the taste it would still have the same great taste so we're going to go ahead and keep dipping and then add the jolly ranchers too [Music] look at how pretty that color is now the reason we add white food coloring is so that the color does not become transparent if you don't add white food coloring to your candy your candy will be transparent meaning that you can see right through and you can see your fruit like if you guys remember in the candy tangerine video we didn't use any color so the candy was clear your candy will be clear with like a light color if you don't put the white food coloring in the white food coloring is what gives it the background basically so that your grapes can turn into a different color so they won't be like you know green with a light blue look and i've tried dipping red grapes however red grapes are really really really sweet so they're not as tasty as using green grapes i think it's more delicious with the green grapes because the sweetness weighs out with the sour to give it a nice taste but with the red grapes it's just overly sour and i mean overly sweet i apologize it's just overly sweet so it's not really [Music] that good because to me too much sweet just takes all the flavor away from it [Music] i was about to dip it in the jolly rancher without putting it in the candy bag [Music] and you see how good our toothpick comes in handy um you can use skewers if you want to um i think the skewers are too long personally i don't like using screwers that's why i choose the toothpick method but there's like a different way for everything and i tell you guys this all the time i teach you guys what works for me i like showing you guys what i like to do there's always a different way for everything i just show you my way and what works for me because you can do it and say oh i don't like her way of doing this i like this way better and that is perfectly fine because there's always a million different ways to do stuff [Music] so my jolly ranchers are almost finished i'm just going to [Music] start using my spoon so i can pick up if you wanted to add a flavor to your candy also you can use the lorraine's flavor oil and you can add that instead of adding the jolly rancher like i did i wanted my jolly rancher flavor since we're using jolly ranchers and their decorations [Music] i'm running out of space [Music] let's just give them a flat bottom instead of a flat back and then you have to dip these real fast also because depending on the temperature of your house the candy batter will start to harden really fast because these are hard crack candy that's why we get it to 300 degrees 300 degrees is the point of hard crack [Music] it's how a lollipop would be you can use the same batter to make lollipops also and of course if you guys try this and i would love to see what you guys did so take a picture and tag me on instagram my instagram is in the description if you guys make these you had problems with them it was easy um whatever happened just let me know leave me a comment let me know if you liked it if it was delicious just let me know how it turned out i would love to hear from you guys [Music] and you see that the jolly rancher candy is already [Music] [Music] the whole time [Music] okay so we're almost done [Music] then i'm going to show you guys how to easily slip your toothpicks off and get ready to serve them eat them enjoy them put them in the refrigerator um if you're saving them for later later like you don't want to eat them right right now put them in the freezer so that they don't start breaking down as fast because they do break down very very quickly very very quickly like i believe candy grapes only last i think a maximum of about two to three hours depending on how you make them depending on the time of the year um to me i find that they last longer in the time because it's colder depending on how hot you keep your house also um in the summertime if you have them outside they will almost melt immediately and the same thing goes for your candy apples also they melt really quickly i'm gonna sprinkle it some of my candy is still on wet most of it has already dry and hardened it gets hard almost immediately after dipping them they dry really really quickly okay we're down to our last three grapes so now we're going to get ready to start pulling off our toothpicks from our grapes and separating it last two roll it in my jolly rancher last one i'm gonna cover it in our jolly rancher there we go [Music] all right so there we go now we're going to slide them off of our [Music] toothpicks and i'm going to put them [Music] and you can tell that the candy is hard when you squeeze it it doesn't get soft or squishy [Music] and that's how it looks when you like into it [Music] it's really crunchy and there we go jolly rancher candy grapes if you enjoyed today's video go ahead and give this video a thumbs up

this oh boy how to be fun haha the seven per container is about thirteen and I really feel like there's a lot more than 13 in here to be honest I feel like there's like thirty maybe okay the amount per serving is 60 calories zero fat zero total fat zero saturated fat zero trans fat zero cholesterol five milligrams of sodium sixteen grams of total carbohydrates zero dietary fiber 12 sugars zero protein I don't think these are really cute friendly I'm about to go over my carbs for the day just trying this out for y'all this is only 20 calories per pop okay there's only 20 calories in this I feel like this is a little bit little 420 calories but I'm going to try every single for y'all it's gonna randomly grab them and try them but I am gonna be trying every single flavor it says this package material has been manufactured in a factory designed and built sleep cynical building guidelines on an equipment powered by 100% wind generated electrical energy which may not have it if the machine is made on is powered by electrical energy okay so the very first one I'm going to try that I just random to grab is perfectly peach I love peach flavored stuff like slight baked peach flavored stuff so hopefully this is good it's pretty it's got like two colors in it it's little it's round it looks like a caramel pop but it's peach it's got like this like two different caramel colors one's like a caramel brown and there's like a car mode dark brown but it's peach flavor try yep fake peach plant flavor I really like this this is if you like pate if you like baked peach flavor you will enjoy this very much Feli can you chew it do social ease permit it's kind of hydrating actually but it does stick to your teeth in that cavity filling type way where it's just like sticky sugar is attached to your teeth I mean it's candy either way whether it's organic or not it's still candy so it's so going to stick to your teeth so if you have issues without I wouldn't recommend these okay the next lever I'm gonna try is strawberry smash and this one is also kind of like two different shades of red what whoa what hold on guys what guys this doesn't taste like plate fake strawberry this tastes like actual strawberry like real strawberry flavor what yeah guy that guys that is a real strawberry flavor right there's not that is not a fake strawberry flavor that fake strawberry flavor like really gives me a headache this is this is like true strawberry flavor what again like a hydrating pool filter because it feels like I'm sorry guys it's like sour like a natural strawberry mmm definitely got that pack that pucker padge to it it's not super sour but it's not fake short way it's like pucker is like an actual strawberry it's really good it does have that hydrating feel to it and the teeth sticking gum I really like that I don't like fake strawberry but I really do like that ok the next one we're going to try is pomegranate a pucker speaking the pucker [Music] and this is like a dark red maroon color I really don't know what pomegranate tastes like I have not had it in like many decades but I'll be honest guys this kind of tastes like a cough drop laughs enjoy this tastes like a loss injure like a lost engineer without all the medicine inside it honestly I don't know what Paul McGann tase is supposed to taste like but if the other toothpaste was like they were supposed to I imagine this is I don't know how I'll contain is supposed to taste like Tomica pomegranate but it's good though it's good it just tastes like that outer hard candy of a loss injure yeah I really don't know what a pom aren't supposed to taste like but it has a hijacking feeling it has that stickiness to the teeth and it's got a pucker tight feel to her let's try very very cherry I love Martian on cherries but I've never had a candy that actually tastes like one let's see if this has that fake cherry taste to it yep tastes like a look at your lollipop it has that fake cherry taste to it like I'm you know like I'm on Valentine's Day you get those like really huge heart-shaped lollipops and you really know what flavor they are I imagine cherry because that's what this tastes like it's good though I but I like cherry flavor it's not fake or real so I should have borne more it starts the taste like by cherry and I like black cherry more than regular cherry I really like that but I'm biased because I really like cherry flavored things but to me that was delicious we four down four more to go oh my gosh let's do razzmatazz berry and I have no idea what that means but I'm assuming raspberry because there's raspberries all over the picture and that's the only thing that's on there is raspberries and it's red so I'm guessing it's raspberry flavored I think I've ever had fake raspberry they were I've only had blue raspberry flavor or mixed berry remember just had raspberry we'll see my teeth kind of heard guys has a lot of sugar three months ago this would have been nothing to me but I don't really consume sugar now that I'm on keto and Wow the yeah my teeth actually feel really heavy would not recommend eating all eight Kent all eight flavors in one sitting and if I was not doing the video for you I would not be doing this I I don't even like all these flavours to be honest okay let's try raspberry huh I guess I don't know what fake raspberries supposed to taste like because I don't taste anything let me bite into it and see if that does something cuz sucking on it I don't taste anything but I don't know what raspberry supposed to taste like only blue raspberry pepper and it's definitely got a pucker to it Wow hmm yes super pucker issue out that it was very sour hmm I'm gonna say sorry but it's very peppery it tastes like the poem I got one too I'm being completely honest um yeah that just is that the pomegranate Ameen hmm and again I don't know what Paul McGrath supposed to taste like so pomegranate and raspberry know what they're supposed to taste like but they say so same to me I may have a very big pucker to them whoa three more to go let's try one that I really am looking forward to I am love watermelon flavored things so I have high hopes for this one you would think that it would be green but it's not it's like a red and then like a reddish white pink a pink color I really thought it was gonna be green yeah definitely that really fake sugary watermelon flavored delicious I love fake watermelon it's really good to me yeah definitely yeah I really like that I really like that a lot mm-hmm Jim Monica we're gonna try the mango tango we don't really know what mingles supposed to taste like guys but I think I like it it's like half orange half yellow which I imagine this the color of a mango um there's mingos supposed to taste like orange like actual orange guys because that's what this tastes like tastes like an orange candy to me okay I think I know what the Mango Tango means okay guys I think that I know why there's two different colors this orange color is orange flavored and this yellow color is mango flavored so this is like an orange mango type flavor Wow mm-hmm and it definitely has that like fake orange soda type flavor to it it's really good I like this I like this a lot yeah I was definitely a flavor of orange and a flavour of something I've never had which I'm assuming is probably mango and if that's fake Meena then yeah fake mangoes actually pretty good and I saved at my least favorite for last I absolutely actually I cannot sense fake star berry and I can't stand fake great so I'm really glad that tasted like real strawberry considering this is completely purple I think this is gonna be fake gratefully right and I really really really do not like fake great flavor but I'm going to do this for you yeah it's most like grape kool-aid or something that I just really don't want to put in my mouth I'm so glad this is the last one oh my gosh ice I just ate sugar for 23 minutes straight oh my god yup fake grape flavor if you like baked grape flavor spot-on you will love this if you are like me and do not like fake grape flavor you will check this in the Josh this is not berry but I'm going to find someone and give all the grapes because I really don't like this big I honestly do not like this fake great type flavor but it sort of tastes like it tastes like what it's supposed to you bite into it it just really tastes like grape kool-aid yeah I would say a lot of these head pucker to him if not all I think all had pucker to them anyways I hope you enjoyed watching me eat sugar for 25 minutes straight because I did not enjoy that anyways guys if y'all want to give these a try these are the young earth organic pops they are actually pretty good I like them I just want to recommend eating eight in a row there's just no I don't know where you would get these because I got on from stock market and I don't know if they are made by five market specifically or if you can just get the or like I don't know if yummy earth is the part that makes them yeah I think it's yum right because it says your mouth calm so I guess there's a part of could call yum yum yum earth but again I got this from Thai market so anyways yeah I hope y'all just enjoyed meeting all that sugar and I hope you have a great day bye", "4dDTG6Ti6YM": "hello everybody and welcome to the video that you've all been waiting for how to make sugar-free lollipops first set the oven to 350 degrees have already done that though next is the mixing since these are sugar free will be using xylitol so first to get half a cup of xylitol okay and the next you'll have half a teaspoon of cream of tartar okay guys I screwed up and accidentally put half a tablespoon in but hopefully it'll be fine so yeah okay next will be 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid just in case you're wondering use cream of tartar there sick citric acid fabric okay so yeah here it oh okay so just gonna get that again one time we put too much citric acid in then what you're gonna do is you're gonna mix it all around so then next what we do is we stick this thing and then we stick it like right there like in the middle of the oven and it's pretty hot as you can see 25 minutes hmm so then you cook it for 25 minutes and then you start it yay okay so you have to do this part very quickly so what we're doing is we're putting coconut spray inside I like you know like the lollipop molds right now so then what I got to do is you know like I'm gonna get like one drop of red food coloring and then one drop whoa that's fine it'll do it'll just be it'll just be red then I guess and then no and then the flavor will be Barbie and then I put Barbie and cream in and then you'll need to mix it up and then what we'll do is we're pour it in there okay so we put the liquid in the lollipop molds and we uh put the lollipop sticks there now just let it dry for four hours",

recorded a video ups if you're like they recorded a little minute so today I decided to do a collaboration video it is a text test video with a couple of my friends from a YouTube nor group and we decided to do either gluten-free cupcakes or mexican lollipops i was going to do both of them but i just decided now I'm the stick with the Mexico the lollipops so I look to my local candies don't i pick them up boom and i got two of women i decided i'm going to try them with you guys today this one is K mango and so we're going to try a mango right now this is what that looks like alright taste test Mexican lollipop let me take my glasses over this Mexican lollipop taste test let's do it like sour but max these our life this is the outer letter Leia said that it was like chili powder of an outside so sure it takes a little bit different on the inside but I can't get past it wait look fat chicks our not volleyball okay okay go with that one I got a little flavor out of it and it does have a little spice to it got a little kick to it after you get like into it so you keep going I'm getting more flavor as I know no lather up the saliva there so it does have a little bit spice to it as you can see on the back I've tried to got in them the chili powder gone now I can taste the mangle tape which is interesting because mango flavor candy only tastes slightly like a mango I love mango what's good to make all good but initially that first case is sour and then after this hour it's a little bit spicy but i like to eat spicy food so it looks not that spicy for open rule so but after you get past the chili is good it tastes like candy I'm just going to have to say this the mango lollipop was good at but it's initially sour with a weird tastes like sour winter like a really weird taste and then when starting to the chili it gets a little tiny bit spicy but not spicy enough to say oh my god i don't like spicy so i can't eat that it's not that serious it's not even half way that the spice of a hot cheeto or playing hot cheeto or you know like plain and watch it why not it has a little teeny tiny tangy taste to it but then honestly that's just a bit this is not really that Peggy is more salary and this weird taste it has like when you initially eat eat some of it like first couple of licks enhances the leader taste to it it's good it's a little you know color and everything so I'm gonna have to say the Mexican public pop was okay i wouldn't search high low for it but you know every once in a while is good to have a little switch up and the mexican lollipop is a good way to switch it up alright so now i really hope that you guys enjoyed watching me taste that mixtape a lollipop oma had some really good facial expressions for you guys don't forget to rate comment subscribe let me know what you think about my video and if we have ever tasted a mexican lollipops please let me know your experience and what do you think about mcternan epoch so also please don't forget to check out my brother and sisters of the lab videos for this taste test we have someone depends on gluten-free cupcakes and also the mexican lollipop so free to check out their information i will have their links down in the description box thank you so much for watching my name is Kayla I'll see you next time", "gNWykIf6GSw": "hi and welcome everybody I will be making prison lollipops today so here's what you need to make prison lollipops first of all you'll need the fold top bags or as you know I used to like to call them the baggies these are the ones that just fold join any fold over you look for the sandwich bag you'll need some of these also you will need some q-tips okay and then you will need a bag of Jolly Ranchers or two if you want to make more the other thing you do that we did in prison is that we had a stinger which is a coil that is wrapped on a cord it's like it's a coil and then it plugs into the outlet and you heat up water so what I'm doing is I'm heating up water on the stove because we're gonna have to boil this okay so what you do first of all is I already have another bag of Jolly Ranchers I'm sure you guys wanted to see me hammer out these Jolly Ranchers I'm sure there's another way to crush them but I actually used a hammer and what I did is I open the box and I took them in I kept them in this okay because then I put a piece of plastic down and then I just smashed them inside this so what we're gonna do is once then they're smashed yeah I have already smashed ones over here they don't want to you watch me hammer forever that's horrible so I'm gonna get my baby out okay and I'm going to put well what I like to do too is I'm making two different colors of lollipops I'm gonna make the green ones with the green apple and then I'm going to make the cherry and watermelon together so we're just open them up and put them if I can get it open rights you know in so many ways I made my pajama it's like super hot in my apartment oh and then I made it go everywhere okay so let me pay attention while I'm doing this because this is the obviously notice the second video I did and the very first one I got Jolly Rancher stuff everywhere so this one's gonna be a little bit better I mean I didn't hammer in the bag so that's that's the smart thing so anyways like I said my apartment is like super hot right now we have in this department we have those old-time heaters so you know radiator ones so it's not like I get to change my heat you know what I mean so when it's cold outside they turn on and it's like super duper high you just turn this down yeah so all I'm doing is supporting the Jolly Ranchers I know you guys can't see this they really need to get a better setup um yeah I wouldn't like the picture that's a me and my mom and jab now when Jasmine was a little baby we did the old-time photos in Wisconsin down it's pretty cool it's sad to put something up there you know I think it looks a little bit better okay so see I got all the green ones together okay and I hope that's enough um and what you're gonna do is once it's in the baggy you're just gonna dip it in there because what you're gonna do is mold these what happens is the Jolly Rancher candy starts to melt it's very hot so it starts to melt and you might also want to grab a towel so then you can like instead of burning your hands you can kind of just kind of mush it together see houses like turn to mush but if your pieces are smaller it's a lot faster than lot easier to actually wash together Marsh what a great word um so what I'm doing is see there's a lot of clumps in this one you can see a lot of clumps is not mushing that well so again I'm gonna keep it in here this don't surprise little velvet oh there she comes the queen bee herself what are you doing my little love book something to you okay so I'm doing is trying to mush this so you got for Mom and into anything you want right now it's looking like a big green blob okay and this is great for the kids too they would have a lot of fun doing this you know melting stuff kids love to melt stuff and if you just let it sit in there it should have crushed them a little smaller it was like the smaller pieces when you have the smaller pieces it's so much easier and they're more finer and a lot easier to form yes so oh yeah this is going good now now it's getting smoother so again you can make any shape or whatever you want I'm going to try and make like a heart shape so you just mold it that's what you're doing so I mean right that's pretty cool huh okay so now I'm old with it right now the fun part about this is you got the molding and when it's hot so it does look like a heart right okay so when it's hot I'm gonna put this back in but right now I'm gonna cut my stick so cuz in prison we didn't have anything to make a stick with so we used a q-tip you know and just cut off to the ends of the q-tip like so this will probably go flying someplace I don't want to go but yeah there you go so you got the little stack all right cut another one you know or you can even peel this little q-tip back right here and cut closer again probably gonna go look went flying okay so now I have it one hold it so I'm gonna open this up okay kind of push that together and the thing is what I want to do now is I want to get this part right here the bottom part heated up so I can slip the stick in okay here we go this guy and you don't have to heat up too long but you got to make sure water is boiling and then what I'm gonna do now to make sure I grab my towel I'm gonna put the stick right inside there okay so you get it in there like that like so I don't if you do sticks there see and now I'm going to kind of just see I lost the shape of my heart so I'm gonna kind of mold it around the stick make sure it's covering on all sides and again I left a little bit of shape of my heart okay so now this one's the first one I'm gonna open it up and see what we got okay sometimes they stick to the bag sometimes they don't but usually you can just fill it right off this one's gonna be a little bugger cause he's sticking because it's still worn so kind of lopsided the heart kind of so it's still one it's still more maybe you should just let it uh kind of cool off a little bit more and don't come off I hope it'll come off there we go there there well that heart didn't turn out right it's a little lopsided mmm what happened well I got another one I'm gonna make two so okay so there's the first one in the lower row okay we set this right over here on the bag okay I let them cool off a little bit so then it can come off easier so the next one is gonna be the pink one so I'm gonna make the pink one and again you can mix the colors you can use any colors you want you you know you don't have to use separate colors that is kind of fun you know you can have two different colors or three different colors you know they don't give you much blues in there that kind of sucks on the Jolly Ranchers you know but I like the blues maybe I should mix in a blue with it ones that look cool sure okay so this one think this Easter maybe I'll make this into an egg so again what we're going to do is going to soak this in here and these are a lot of fun to make I mean they are what your joint huh oh yes my little daughter thing mine is a dark no you can't have candy no you can't sweetie no this is one treat you don't care I know no no no mama plum is cooking okay you just behave and don't jump anymore you're not supposed to know yes it wouldn't be a video of velvet embalming right yes okay so let me get on my towel again you're not going up there no no it's not for you not for you honey okay and as you can see what no you know my little darling okay so this one as I said I'm gonna make an egg shape so we're a circle again again you know what it's much easier to melt um if you're you know if they're like not to see how the chunky that is on a fuse and see that it's like really really like chunky in there so you know it's gonna take a while to melt definitely going to melt this a little bit more and I have my stick ready okay now this okay there we go okay Circle Circle look at that I'm gonna get circ okay now when we do here so open this up real quick at the bottom because it's still warm and gooey stick that stick in the middle and then this is the coolest part so what you're gonna do is make sure okay that when you got the stick in the middle and if you can see that stick right there make sure you kind of tuck it in there and smoosh around it because otherwise what's gonna happen is your sticks gonna fall out and you don't want your stick to fall out I'm just saying okay so this one's nice and pretty look at that okay so I'm gonna let this cool for a minute okay if this one cool for a minute well I definitely take a bite of this one and there's real amazing doesn't look like a heart anymore so sorry about that but oh good so this is how you make prison lollipops I hope you enjoyed and please subscribe or you know whatever you guys want to do and I'll be making more videos so you guys can learn all the tricks and trades that we used to do in prison why", "faZlOcEVbqs": "today I have bazooka sour straws watermelon edition hey there ladies and gentlemen KJ and EO is back in the house this time I have an illiquid review of watermelon sour straws from bazooka vape they're located out of Los Angeles California nice 200 mil bottle we're talking right here it sells for $44.99 over at vape society supply or you could get a sample pack of all three of their flavors for $4.99 each in 15 mil bottles okay I did purchase this I did pay for I did not get a free for review I was curious after I had the strawberry ones I'm like I got to try the watermelon ones out I'm going to try to get the Apple ones also there's a sour apple version like to try that as well so this shipping on this is going to be six dollars and 43 cents from vape society supply the ratio is a 70/30 blend 70 VG 30 PG nicotine strengths available are zero three and six milligrams as I mentioned there are three flavors in their product line they have strawberry green apple and watermelon today I'm going to review the watermelon sour straws the flavor intensity of this one I'd say is moderate okay so there's like low there's high moderates right in the middle that's where I'm at steeping is not needed for this e-liquid you could purchase it from vape society supply.com I will put a link to them in the description down below so you can your order your own bottle today alright so the packaging is very much like the last one in fact that's exactly like the last one comes in this nice box right here as warnings on the back on the side here's what it looks like on this side here's what it looks like you open up the package and inside you have a tray that comes out which houses the main bottle just like that and you also have these two empty 15 mil unicorn bottles that you could take with you on the go in case you don't want to carry the big boy around you know so here's a look at the actual big bottle itself that is a big bottle right open up the cap nice unicorn tip easily fill any tank with this or use it to drip although the smaller bottles might be easier to work with you know but it has all the warnings the California prop 65 underage sale prohibited as bunch of other stuff as well really like the design of the bottles the budget of the bottle is like a bazooka shell okay like you put in the tube you know it's a bazooka that's what it is alright so let's go ahead and do a smell check oh my gosh it smells so good it smells just like those watermelons sour straws in the little trays really good indeed let me do a taste test oh wow totally watermelon candy all the way Wow sourness it's got watermelon it's got a sour note to it it's sweet but not too sweet okay alright today I'm going to be vaping this in the twisted messes RDA I got the IPV 400 that I just reviewed and last I had it was 130 watts I think I'm going to leave it there it was vaping really nice at that wattage right there alright let's do a few drips on here make sure I'm all freshly juiced up slap the cap back on here we go Wow that flavor is really really good really delicious indeed is so true to the form of the real candy you know and I usually don't like candy vape so I'm going to tell you right now the reason in which I don't like them most candy vapes have this weird kind of aftertaste I don't know if it's the type of sweetener that they use but it always leaves a funny taste in my mouth and also on the end of the exhale I don't get that with these flavors not at all so if you've been like kind of shy to try candy vapes because of that weird aftertaste that I'm talking about you won't have it here definitely not here it's really decent so delicious man oh man it's just so delicious so delicious like I said I don't like candy vapes usually I love this one I actually love the strawberry one a little better but that's because it's in my flavor profile love strawberry vapes you know but this is exactly the same just watermelon it's done just right and it totally earns and deserves a KJ and yo flavor rating of 5 out of 5 stars every day all night and day this stuff is bomb right here okay alright the vapor production it is a 70/30 let me drip a little bit more and you know the way I do my paper production tests can do in that way and going to do one that way okay had to turn the fan off before I do this test don't want the vapor going everywhere it is a hot one today again in Southern California alright here we go nice dense clouds they drop down they definitely stay in the air all right here's one for you guys out in YouTube land definitely clouds up rather nicely wouldn't you say so I know where I'm at this flavor I'm going to give a vapor production rating of 4 out of 5 stars that's what I think it deserves really great I mean it's almost four and a half stars it's like so teetering on the edge you know really a lot of vapor dense vapor stays in the air what more could you ask for you know so that's it that is my take on watermelon and sour straws from bazooka vape go get yours today over at vape society supply.com I don't think you'll be disappointed if you like the flavor profile you're going to love this juice all right so I think that's about all I got for you on it I really thank you guys for watching if you enjoyed the video you know the drill hit that thumbs up button show me some KJ Andy oh love and if you haven't subscribed go ahead and subscribe I got a lot more stuff coming up folks all right you guys take care have a stellar day be excellent to everyone most of all remember me on KJ Andy Oh your host with the most see on the next video peace", "ngoSbRl6css": "hi everyone this is gonna be a quick DIY on this lollipop flowers that I'm making for Leah's birthday slash baptism it's coming up on May 9th and I just wanted to show you guys how to make them in case you want to use on the ass you know table decorations or something like that so I'm using dum dum lollipops and the reason for this is because they are small and pretty easy to handle with and also my sister and I picked them because she's the one with that came up with the idea so yeah and also just take regular tape and you're gonna use whatever kind of paper or not paper Sprenger that you want and what I'm doing right now is I am just getting a long string I'm sorry for the background noise Aliyah is favorite toy and yeah all I'm gonna do is just grab a piece and rip it and also get a piece of tape it could be maybe like six inches long smaller however you want it to be but the shorter you do it it gives your your lollipop like that more flowery look so yes you can see I taped it down to the table oh it's not taped down to the table but I put it on the opposite side of the sticky side so I can just easily tape the the paper the paper I keep on saving paper the springer into the tape directly and after that I'm just gonna like kind of like fold it and like tape it and fold it a bit hold it is it's something really easy it's hard to get used to but once you know how to do it and you do the first two or three you'll get the hang of it I promise another thing I forgot to tell you guys or I almost forgot to tell you guys is that don't tape your springer all the way down just leave it halfway down so the other little part or extra tape that you have fit there you're gonna use it to tape that to your lollipop so yeah just be careful and don't take the springer all the way down okay so now I'm just gonna grab my lollipop and I'm gonna start taping it from the stick of my lollipop and then it's just gonna work itself through and it's gonna just work its way up and that's totally fine if the tape just you know starts going up towards the lollipop it's actually going to make it look more like a flower because it's gonna make it look more puffy so it's fine as you can see here I had some trouble and just keeping it in one place but I noticed that if I just let it keep them going up and then I just had to do what it wants to do it'll actually make it look more puffy and more pretty see I told you guys there it is this is the final look and however you don't have to put it or I just have it now which is in the Springer you don't have to put it there I just put it there so I could show you guys but thank you all for watching don't forget to Like subscribe comment down below and I'll see you guys next time", "1-obqjbM-54": "oh I like your costume Sally thank you get swept I got you something I got you a surprise

was just late morning black doctor lately wait Pete try crow there you go give us a little bit different don't be taken against some edibles so that further ado come to the close-up and Pete that [Music] all right Burke up just most bird emoji flat from the comment section as we take a look at today's edible today we're looking at these I guess the watermelon pieces and this is from the cannabis candy company oh this is actually gonna be my first package of anything from now says this 300 milligrams of THC this is a tea but ain't you know that that's my favorite out of sativa indica because it's the more creative kind of uh hi um however when you take edibles it's a different experience than smoking we wanna do is you wanna get could eat out the pack see what these two mile I see if they smell like candy if they smell heavily we then will taste you wanna see oh if it tasted the same let's get these things out the pack I see they look like all right bear cub that was not the easiest package to open well we did get it open finally on these gummies have a nice sugary coating they don't really smell too much of a cannabis they kind of just smelled like Borden on candy I'm going to you gonna go ahead and see what they taste like huh man see you see if they got like the more cannabis or more of a candy flavor 300 milligrams I guess for this whole packet I don't know how strong it cannabis taste will be but let's find out all right Burke up about to uh try these edibles and see um how much of a cannabis tasted you know it doesn't smell like like smells like candy but not but there's a back layer smell on it makes them not like smell the most appetizing but my steak room temperature it's a nice texture I'm not really din I'm a deep Canada's taste I'm getting more like a bunch ill or a fish you watermelon flavor plus our to toss harbor and not really like I'm not tasting today like stepmama TV this is Joey do you in the Mitzvah the aftertaste ain't even a relief it would like like a lot of cannabis flavor they'll do intoxicating the fact that this product may be delayed by up to two hours oh so we have to taking these you might have to wait two hours maybe I I'm already hot because I've been smoking all day um I guess I guess we'll see if these in our pride take about two more that's like three pieces should give you know I mean a decent filling mum again not not strong cannabis taste our hair other edibles where you taste it read write and told me you just taste cannabis cannabis cannabis this is a tart watermelon this is kind of like the best way I can describe it but we'll see how they develop I'm with them to a more I'm out birkut flat flat [Music] [Music]", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "p7h1qlhCdig": "what's up cbd lovers welcome to i love cbd today i'm doing a review on some cbd edibles this baby right here this is um cbd gummies it is by a company called smokies edibles um this flavor is the sour watermelon cbd gummies and this package right here contains 10 servings so each serving is pretty much like a gummy i'll show you what it looks like um here we go this is a a pretty little pinkish radish cube very tasty by the way it tastes really good um each one of these gummies contains 25 milligrams of cbd now this product is not full spectrum this is cbd isolate um cool thing about this product or the things that i like about it um first of all it says on the front it's high clarity hemp extract right here so it's high quality uh it's gluten free it's dairy free it's vegan it has no high fructose corn syrup which is good healthy you don't want to consume anything with high fructose corn syrup because that stuff is bad for you anyways um and for my concern you know i don't consume any gelatin products this does not contain indian gelatin which is rare for gummies and you know that kind of candy so that's something that's a huge plus for me because if i had gelatin i wouldn't have even tried it um ingredients uh it's got sugar corn syrup pectin dextrose citric acid sodium acetate natural artificial flavorings you know some colorings and hemp extract cbd isolate so um this is very good and you know if you're concerned about any allergies or anything this product is manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts so i always review your ingredients if you have any allergies or if you're worried about this containing anything that you may be allergic to uh but definitely for people that are concerned about uh thc they don't want to test positive for thc or they wanna they don't wanna consume anything with thc in it uh this is what you wanna go with if you're using if you wanna use cbd and not consume any thc so this has no thc in it it says right here it's isolate and each one of those gummies has 25 milligrams now the recommended dosage or the serving size listed on the package is 25 milligrams so that's what i tried out the first time however i believe my tolerance has gone up uh because i've been using some 50 milligram capsules and uh the 25 milligrams gave me like a very mild effect so i wasn't really able to judge it so i decided to take two gummies which would be 50 milligrams today and i tried it out and i definitely felt it um i felt the effects were really good i was very mentally relaxed very physically relaxed i had a little bit of strain and back pain in my lower back my pain wasn't gone but it eased my pain a bit for sure uh helped me with a little bit more mobility and you know i wasn't in pain every time i moved or sat down or got up so i definitely felt the effects uh there was some mood enhancement as well uh kind of gave me a little bit of a lift i was not sleepy at all still still awake uh i took it i think uh probably about four hours ago so i'm not not sleepy but i do feel like if when i do go to sleep i'll probably sleep good tonight and um yeah i like the stuff it tasted good i think it's a clean product um i found it online for 22.99 i will leave you guys a link in the description i'll probably put a link up here on the video somewhere uh make it easy for you if you want to check it out or if you want to try it out you could go to this website which i found and they have some pretty good deals and they have a huge selection of cbd products so i'm gonna start uh referring them uh or referring you guys to them uh in case you wanna try the products or any review that you see a product on and you wanna check it out instead of having a search and look all over the internet for it you could just find an easy link so you could go and try it out if you want to all right uh this is all i got for this one um i think i would have to give this a five stars uh five five-star rating um i think it's a good product um i also like the bag the bag has like a ziploc thing so once you open it it you know one thing i noticed is the bag wasn't sealed like i was looking to see if there was a seal or somewhere you could tear and there's nothing i was just able to open it up but it has a zip lock on it so once you open it up you could you know zip it back up and it will keep the gummies fresh so they don't get stale or dry up inside and become really hard uh so yeah five stars for these smoky edible smokies edibles um i think it's a good product i would definitely try it out especially for people that are not looking for full spectrum or like looking for thc free cbd all right i want to keep this short as possible and that's all i got for this one um i hope you guys find this video helpful or useful and if you like it give it a like if you don't it's okay it's okay it's okay maybe the next one um and if you like cbd like we do subscribe and you will stay updated with all my reviews and you probably want to hit that notification button so whenever i release

new product that we just got into the studio I guess it's been maybe a couple of months now months it's Smokey's gummies edibles they are actually out of Oregon and this company Smokies started with a THC product a product that includes THC and they only recently just started having CBD products on their lineup as a result you don't see terribly much information on their website but that is why we wanted to do this review it's really funny the the salesman you're really good of an away the salesman gave me a call it was a random maybe Friday afternoon and wanted to know if we wanted to carry these in the studio and where yoga and wellness studio so I thought no I actually no I thought no we don't need any more gummies and he said no no let me just send you these I'm telling you as soon as you've tried them you'll buy them and he was right they're good he sent me five different varieties and four gummies and one hard candy we still carry all of those in the studio and they were so good the first one I had is a different one that that we will review later the first one I had was so good I couldn't just eat one ga - no I ate all of them I one of all this so I basically had no beauty function the hard candies only had 15 milligrams so there was I think it I think I did the math it was like 85 milligrams so I must have had only four samples anyways I was not high because there is zero THC I did see it let's show them that there's that on the back corner there's zero THC so I was a high but but let me tell you ladies I did not care no should I think you're the rest today I was like what is wrong and then I put in a huge order because I love them and so does everybody else so in this bag you get ten gummies that are 25 milligrams of CBD each the nutrition labels right here on the back there is about 2 grams of sugar per gummy so it's not too bad for those people out there that are concerned about sugar and bean gummies they are 25 milligrams and each gummy right here well I'm just reiterating it there that's a logic of me CBD love all the gummies are gluten free they're not all vegan friendly they do have some vegan friendly options and we carry we have so couple of those flavors in the studio though we also have some sugar-free options as well yep that's true but today's review is on the watermelon flavors not just watermelon it's sour watermelon so I'll just take it from the team so you're gonna notice like when you open they come resealable which is really nice oh my gosh and I'm having trouble getting it open this might be a sign I did not I did not and they're little bitty squares and they're super delicious I actually really like the sour kinds of candies and so this is like a holler back to like the lemon heads or what are those super sour candies that the kids love these days anyway so they're a better sweet tarts but they're gummies but these are gummies in there there's no that's our daughter she just went potty okay so we will have to finish this review very quickly so this um you'll see a little bit of the sugar on the outside it tastes amazing you can eat half of it and then you get like half of the CBD but we preferred all of it so we like to eat all of it yep and if you got our website they said they're revamping their website so it's really because of the THC and because the laws in Oregon have changed to where they can't market gummies anymore because of kids obviously so the website will be updated in the next couple of months is what they said that they're a little bit behind but I wanted to show you the website a little bit they also said I actually talked to our rep on the phone today here is here is the about page well let me see if I can show you my inner I'm only as fast on my internet so as you can see it's a really nice website it's really pretty the problem is the about page is pretty it's it's pretty bare-bones right now they do not offer the third-party test results they do not offer any of the like ingredients list and you also can't buy the products online from their website yet however you can buy them from our thrive hemp store website thrive hemp store calm we should be able to keep the inventory updated there I hope and if you ever have any doubts you can give us a call at four to three to nine zero to three to six again this is in the US we can ship inside the US once you start shipping overseas it gets a little hairy I believe I know that several other CBD companies do have trouble trying to ship overseas so if you're interested in trying a really good it's absolutely delicious gummy it has 25 milligrams of CBD isolate it is not the full spectrum it is a nice lip we absolutely love the Smoky's brand CBD we sell a whole bunch of these things have actually kind of over passed our other brand that we had in the studio and so we absolutely love them and think you should try it out the sour watermelon is awesome so is basically every flavor so as a result of that we're gonna like review every flavor so that we get to taste them that's right so if you like this review or have some products you would like us to review send them to us yeah yeah and leave us a note below let us know what you think of the Smokey's CBD gummies with 25 milligrams each and if you want to buy some check us out at thrive hipster calm see you soon buh-bye thanks so much", "JdISM7UWDaQ": "[Music] the matter one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are not taking my advice and we are looking at a gummy edit pure for the first time we're looking at up here I've actually had people tell me that ed up yours is their favorite gummy and that is a gummy that is actually potent I guess be watch weights before you've seen in my other gummy reviews you know I find them a pretty lackluster to be honest I never really thought one to be as potent as advertised so I come to Ed appear with as cautiously optimistic as one can be excited but not overly you know I've got some reservations so this is a two hundred and fifty milligrams edible the watermelon belts from Ed appear it cost me I believe about about twenty dollars so it's an expensive edible expensive gummy edibles so hopefully that means it will be more potent as I said never had a head up here before I had had several different gummy brands so this is the first time they had a bunch of different gummies they're from Ed uh pure I picked up a bunch to do some reviews so look forward to those in the future and if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our abuse work is I'm gonna down this product here this time I think I'm gonna just gonna eat the whole thing in front of you guys cuz it's only five belts and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review how you feel not so much how it tastes so without further ado let's open this bad boy up and give it a taste and it looks like okay packaging is easy to open which is always nice so here we are here here's the little rainbow belt or the excuse me watermelon belt there are five of them in here each with 50 milligrams of THC or so they are as advertised here we go mmm that is rough those do not taste good there's a heavy we tasted that and guys if you will excuse me I forgot ahead of time as with all my gummy reviews I like to have a little bit of fat before I eat the gummies because I believe the fat is a good vessel for the for the THC to sort of be impacted in your bloodstream in your liver and so forth so uh if you excuse me for just a moment I'm gonna go grab some fat and I'll be right back I'm back with a spatula and some Nutella let's get some fat in me before I even need more of these gross OHS mmm now that is a good taste who doesn't like Nutella just gotta get a little bit more of me all right that's ingesting so you guys can see I will be ingesting these rainbow belts use me watermelon belts under optimal conditions now let's go ahead and eat a couple more here those are terrible Wow Wow it is like eating liquefied weed oh boy man that means they have potent okay guys well I am going to finish the last three of these here and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these are feeling because that is the most important part of any edible review not the way it tastes but the way it makes you feel so guys with that I will see you in two hours peace guys it has been two hours since I had the head of pure watermelon belts and I'm not sure that they're going to change my opinion on candies or gummies but they are more potent than the infused creations or voodoo sours that I've had and reviewed in the past so that I definitely feel something so that is certainly an improvement over those it's still just not as potent as other 250 milligram a tea bowls that I've had just doesn't compare to tons of like brownies cookies whatever sort of in the confectionary genre but I do want to give better pure credit for being the most potent candy that I've had so far even if it's not as potent as it would be in similar milligram form and like a confectionery product and they taste it awful they tasted straight-up disgusting just just like weed I mean weed in a gummy form it was just really gross but again so if you really like gummies or candies go with the ED appear over infused creations or voodoo sours because these are definitely stronger for sure but for me I think I'm gonna stick with confectionaries however I do have a or at appear to review so we'll be sure to get those reviews out to you as well and let you know if those products are more potent than the watermelon belts until then guys thank you so much for watching

intensify their flavor and let them release their sweet juices we're then gonna mix that into our lollipop base add a little bit of flavoring and pour them into freeform lollipops and here's how we're gonna make them we're first gonna make our flavoring for these lollipops so I have a hundred and seventy grams of blueberries 28 grams of granulated sugar one tablespoon of freshly squeezed orange juice and a quarter teaspoon of freshly grated orange zest and I put it into a little square pyrex dish you want something that has tall enough sides because we're gonna bake this and so we wanna be able to catch all those juices I'm just gonna stir this around we're gonna bake this in a preheated 375 degree oven just until all the blueberries burst I've just taken the blueberries out of the oven and they have been in there for about 35 minutes they are completely cooked down and the juices are oozing out of them we're gonna take this and carefully because this is still hot we're gonna put it into our blender we're now gonna whiz this up until it's a nice puree we're gonna get our blueberry puree out of our mixer and we will set this aside while we whip up our lollipops to make our lollipop base I have 133 grams of corn syrup already in my saucepan I measured it on my scale directly into the pan it's just because it's so sticky I don't want to waste any of it because you need to be really accurate when you are making candy I'm gonna go ahead and add 200 grams of granulated sugar 75 grams of water I'm gonna go ahead and put this on the stove over medium heat and we're gonna cook this until it reaches 315 degrees while our sugar mixture is on the stove we're gonna prepare our candy making station I have a towel to set the pot on as soon as it comes off the stove I have 20 grams of our roasted blueberries already ready to go in a container I also have one container of blueberry flavoring this is one DRAM I have a spatula because what's gonna happen is we're going to take it off the stove put it on to our towel we're gonna add both of our flavorings and mix it we're then going to pour it into a heatproof jug and then I have two trays I think I might just use one but just in case I need a second one and I have a Silpat mat on mine but you can use parchment paper and set if you like and the reason I'm using my macaron one is because it has circles already on it and it's about the diameter of the lollipop that I want to make we're gonna be making about one and a half inch lollipops I also have my sticks which are four inches ready to go in a little cup on standby once the sugar comes to temperature this is going to happen really fast that way when it's ready to go we can just assemble [Music] we're just gonna set these aside to cool probably for about an hour before taking them off the Mount and enjoying them well that's it for this episode of the gold TSP I hope you guys enjoy my blueberry lollipop give me ideas for any flavors or any other candies you'd like to see me make please leave me a comment down below and I'll do my best to make it happen if you haven't yet subscribe hit that button now and like the video if you did I'll see you guys in the next video", "mSteP3LK3lU": "Oh no Hey guys, I'm so excited Today I'm gonna make Janik try Mexican candy So this is gonna be round two because last time Joss tried German candy and today I'm gonna try Mexican candy I'm excited to try it until now I have successfully Refused to eat chilli candy. Yeah, yeah, he has never tried it ever! but today's the day so excited Let's start city Sevillanas It looks like caramel with paper She's more excited than me It's pretty good, it's like we could have that in Germany - so pretty normal I like it but super sweet you wouldn't finish more than one? -No -Really? don't need more than one because is so sweet I like salty candy like licorice. Oh, no we all know how that ended up next one that looks like fun Vero Tarrito, Yeah is literally a beer popsicle, Una cerveza por favor. I'm ready for the beer I'm the worst person at opening candy, okay didn't take that long Pretty good huh, but I don't know what it tastes like tastes like lemon a little bit. the top tastes different than the bottom. Let me try The top part tastes like Sugar is soury oh yeah, mmm Soury but sweetie. next one chilly. Let's start with the chilli. Oh, No Okay, we're gonna start with Pelon Pelo Rico. Oh one of my all time favorites, it is called delicious hair Uh-huh of course I cannot open it oh my god How are you able to eat anything in Mexico? because I only take it like with my mouth You have to push it down, and then the hair grows and then you eat the hair is hard. It's super hard to push I don't know if you can see it. Oh scared! Little spicy for some people I don't know it tastes good, but also weird at the same time It's ah no It's not bad But in between it's just weird. I think it's the tamarind thing, but it looks very werid when it comes out No, that's not what she said can I choose one? Pica Pepino, that means spicy cucumber yeah, is a cucumber I gotta go. bye This is one of my favorite all-time favorite Chili y'all these ones that have chili center you take a while to get to the chilli  oh, that's fine, we don't have enough time Yeah, we do Until now it's good timelapse until we get to the chilli O it Just takes too long Years later I'm getting there I can feel the spiciness tho Yeah, I can't because I can take more spicy things than her yeah the weirdest announcement of today It's not bad. Oh I'm so happy about it. Now I'm gonna take this today rellerindas Rellerindos, rellerindos, ingredients chilli? Take the whole thing out I can't it's stuck, that's what she said It's not bad, but it's also not super cool So this is dulce de leche, this literally it looks like dog poop with nuts Good yeah, i like it very nutty it looks like fun. It's so much fun my favorite Lucas mango somehow everything is your favorite You say that with everything this one is a mango flavor and the mango flavor is my favorite lucas powder. Why does Lucas keep following you around. snap off tip Oh Easygoing it has chili does it? Is it amazing or what, it's like ahoi brause No, it's not like ahoi brause with chili tho does it? This is so much better than ahoi brause It's sour sweet like me What does it have though doesn't have chili. yodada haha Is delicious but also a little weird - why? it has chili, would you keep eating it probably if we don't have anything else in the house then yes I really was hoping that you wouldn't like it so I could finish all of it myself duvalin This is like my childhood They made the packaging so difficult to open I'm not kidding, well it looks like Nutella with white Nutella This is exciting this looks like pudding in Germany, whoa even with spoons It is like nutella to me, I'm gonna try to put it on bread what tomorrow morning Oh my god the German way,  now this, look. We have a whole thing Sorry I am going to try it without further ado yeah Okay, that's caramel normal like we have in Germany pretty much the same Guayaba role It's like something that I recognize from somewhere Rollo de Guayaba Ate de membrillo,  I'm the worst at opening!  she's the worst opening I'm gonna open it Taste like the other thing that we had before, it is completely different and now  the grand finale the scary finale something that I wanted Janik to try  since forever Vero elotes That's the thing that I'm most scared of let me look for one with more chili. No you don't have to do that looks like a lot of chili ah Okay last one for today, and then I'm gonna wash my mouth This is honestly the most disgusting thing I've ever tried. This is horrible like all the other things were not bad You know, but this one is way out of line. It's so good for real Don't believe him try it you can take all the chili away. I'm gonna keep eating this okay Yeah, we can do that because it also has a chili center, what? Oh, then. No. I don't want it at all No, I don't like it Okay I have a last one, I brought us a surprise okay, you cannot see okay? German candy Chewie we're home This is good. This is good no So my summary from today. I'm surprised oh Yay, a lot of your candy even with chili is good But still this is the worst other stuff like this one is what did I say? I don't remember you say it was weird You're gonna, try it again. If you don't remember Yeah So my favorite is this this lollipop. Oh because it doesn't have Chili, of course he chose the beer I'm not surprised, but all the other stuff is alright. You know it was good. I like that I'm so happy that you liked a lot of it, I was expecting you to hate pelon, and I was expecting you to hate lucas Yeah I'm happy so if you want to see the other way around where Joss tried the German candy you see it either here Or here and if you are Mexican Please let us know what candy did I forget to show Janik and next time we'll go to Mexico and also try some more stuff.

Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an

fans by rocking fan", "No5pa2YqLus": "from whacks fangs to gummy eyeballs Halloween is a time to explore candy that can only be called gross and what could be more gross than eating bugs if you've ever wanted to chew on a cricket or feel a chocolate-covered worm slide down your throat don't go anywhere we're off to Southern California where they don't hide the bugs you can see them waiting inside every lollipop most people wouldn't eat bugs unless they were in candy and you got to give him some motivation more than 10 years ago Larry Peterman bought a candy store in Pismo Beach California he started making his very own bug candy and the rest they say is bug history found out that people kind of like insects and so he says let's put some in some candy and see what happens and chocolate-covered anything we even put chocolate onto anything people or eat it Daniel the resident bug Dipper dips crickets in chocolate the chocolate really gives it that get flavor like kind of when you are you chocolate dipped on strawberries or just add that sweet sweet flavor to it some people will give anything a try at least once ooh what is this chocolate-covered insects oh it keeps you jumping and wiggling the other kind of things but that's not all amid the taffy and rock candy lurk worm suckers ant candy and insect inside pops larry was the first to put bugs inside hard candy mmm just tastes like grape right now but once you get down to it then it's like crunchy at the worm and cricket making the suckers is a bug filled process the empty molds wait for the bait while the sea repeats up add a little protein and the stick now the liquid sweetness sugar and spice and everything nice believe it or not buyers are not just kids Larry says his most loyal customers are women ages 25 to 50 you know it's fun to see what people say so you can you know really get somebody something that's really disgusting if you do get a gift that makes your skin crawl remember there is an extra-special way to eat it the best way to do it is to lick around until you get just a bug by itself and then you can have the full flavor of the bug without the flavor of the candy and going along with it when you get to the cricket you bite into it but you can't really find it now I've really never seen a worm look quite like that kind of grosses me out that could be a fake one you know that this is pulling my leg making me get also a beast because I'm gonna eat a worm but don't worry these are not your ordinary household bugs Larry is devoted to quality control we raised our insects on good grains good fruits vegetables that kind of thing and prepare them in a way that's acceptable to the FDA to put in the candy Larry sells over 2 million worm pops every year he offers many other surprisingly sweet treats to Gunnar gomez for one is satisfied a lot of us out here", "TSlmHKtWGAs": "i'm not sure how much of a coincidence this is but i've got a bit of targeted advertising from amazon to for something it thinks i might be interested in 24 bottles of watermelon flavoured water sponsored targeting i've got 10 hours and 25 minutes to clean this lightning deal or the reminder that i got this morning as well from the water company that i need to pay my half yearly bill i know which one i'm drawn to not the um the flavored plastic bottles but the unlimited supply of freshly cleansed splosh that's going to come out of my tap when i pay my bill hmm", "SDOkqQD1cc4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] so hey what's up guys and welcome to a brand new episode of spike reviews now today i'm reviewing a product that i didn't even know existed now i've reiterated this fact many many times over but you guys know that i am in love with talkies and i have a fixation for them and i love them so i'm wearing purple for a reason this is apparently a brand new takis related product in candy form so needless to say i'm excited and i got a whole box of them yeah so it contains six portions of the candy it is chamoy flavored lollipop with chili and it's by barcell the people the company that makes takis of course and that's all the information that's on the outside is a very plain box it looks like a box that you would set up at a store so i think i got the big boy industrial version it says cut and remove so let's go ahead and unbox this because yeah i'm interested i didn't even know this product existed to be honest so uh yeah try and do our best here oh there we go there's one two one more side it's full of tape that's why it's so hard oh there we go there we go look at this look at this oh okay okay it's not focusing [Music] dang that's a big bag there's six of them all right let's get one out let's save the rest for later oh okay oh damn this is this is definitely a uh display box here so i was thinking that it was gonna be six portions with one lollipop per portion but apparently according to the bag there are three lollipops with chili powder to dip so this is like a very very mexican version of a dippin pop what are they called dipping dipping pop so swim swamy slippy slappy slimming salmon simmons swan swenson swanson lolli dip whatever i don't remember right now but i'll put it on the screen i don't know why i can't remember but this is the very very mexican version right here the takis version of that candy um but yeah apparently one of these bags is three portions so it's an unboxing within an unboxing so let's dig into this all right let's see what we got inside i'm loving how that smells it reminds me of those mango chili pops that hispanics grew up with man i love those things this smells just like that and uh it has a little bit of a tacky smell to it too alright so each one of these bags six bags to a box a big boy size this one's stuck there we go so each one of those bags has three individual little bags so that's that's a lot of candy that's a lot of portions hopefully i like this because i have so many uh who knows maybe i'll give one away hmm maybe i'll have a little giveaway i should have giveaway alright so here it is takis fuego lollipop with dip now i'm really curious to see if the lollipop's actually shaped like a takis or if it's incredibly deformed uh like a lot of candy is why are we still here [Music] just to suffer so let's see 70 calories nobody cares about that it's candy if you're eating candy you're not looking at the calories [Music] mouth is watering already all right opened one up we'll save the rest for later alright let's smell test don't breathe that in kids that's very strong all right smells delicious and it has a lot of powder about that much powder in the bag which doesn't seem like a lot but there's a lot of sodium in here so that's plenty you don't need any more than that so here's the lollipop kind of looks like a taki kind of not really there it is it's already it's already very heavily covered in that powder so i guess i won't have to do much dipping for the first dip for the first taste test i guess so uh yeah cheers let's just dig in is this tos am i gonna have to [Music] you'll get the uncensored version on another website yeah all right but in all honesty that's pretty good oh there it goes now you can actually see the little uh shape of the takis the little roll i guess that you would see on a rolled takis corn chip so kind of similar but the taste pretty good this uh man this is bringing bringing childhood flashbacks right here growing up in a hispanic household ah so good so good that's good that's really good now i will say does it taste like the takis seasoning that comes on the chips kind of not really it tastes more like the traditional chili powder that you get and you come to expect with the mexican tamarindo candy and i probably should have paid more attention to the packaging here because the reason it tastes so similar to that mexican candy is because it's a collaboration look at this right here on the wrapper is takis and vero vero is the company that makes those mango lollipops full of chili powder that we all love so much growing up uh so it makes sense as to why it tastes exactly like that lollipop probably should have looked at the packaging a little closer but still very tasty this is the collaboration of childhood mexican dreams the collaboration that dreams are made out of but uh yeah so this is a winner for me i mean it did y'all expect anything else from ataki's product when it comes to me reviewing it come on now all right simple enough i'm gonna have to give this product a 10 out of 10. very rare 10 out of 10. i will be eating more of these now that i have so goddamn many and i might give one away so i'll come up with a little contest in the future maybe in the comments below but in the description below i will think of something i'll put it in the description and maybe i'll send one out to one of you viewers so pay attention to the description of this video on how to get one of these alright guys that's been another episode of spike reviews as always please like comment and subscribe hit that little bell so you're notified every time i drop a brand new video wash your

you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey its Lucky Penny shop and I made a totally different angle than I normally am because this hopefully was going to be the thumbnail so a lot of times we have to set them up and snap a quick picture before the video before I actually open them up and destroy them so let me zoom out a little bit cuz normally I would not be that way and that close these are the chupa chupa chups chupa chups melody pops i'm not sure what that is to be honest with you I see strawberry flavored that is a weird angle isn't it hold on a second I'm almost straight down this is all I would normally start a video so I can hold him up like that to you all right let's see who can read this I can't there's tons of information here and I can't die I don't know it's just such tiny tiny print and the camera will only focus so well on this tiny print then enough for you to help me out I just want to make a whistle that's all okay just want to whistle I feel like whistling with my whistle pop all right so the first layer has been removed from my whistle pop and now there's a second layer now my whistle pop appears to have a crack so let's see hopefully that's why we have to just in case Shh not a very good whistle on that one hopefully this one's not cracked and this isn't our first whistle tinea think we've gone 3 or 4 leavin at the maker lever there make it I used rules of it this one's not cracked so let's see Shh much better now this one said strawberry - so now I'm thoroughly confused because color wise I see two completely different colors again let's try the broken one Shh got a leak and the good one so it works pretty good oh yeah was the tooth sweet maker that we did I'm gonna just give it a taste maybe I can put it back together it almost has like a waxy coating on it Shh a little better hold on trying to fill in the gap Shh yeah it is a straw strawberry flavor and it's tasty it's good it's nice that you can whistle but you know of course if they're broke you're not gonna get a good whistle let's see if I can open this up a little bit better here while we we gotta look all at writing here look at how tiny that writing is I can't make out really any words there okay basically this will help something let's see if I could read any of this now this looks like chupa chups chupa chups chupa c hup ACH i ok nothing there helps me UK IC UK strawberry flavor lollipop ingredients ok so I can read that well it's tasty it works when it's not cracked so you can see the kind of design hole here and then travels through this and then out this area there's no other holes that I see anywhere unless the lollipop handle itself is a solid plastic so it's not used for thee noise oh wait it does look like it goes all the way through so I'm guessing then I'm not sure if it stops it or what hard to see inside hold on yeah I don't feel any air coming out of the side that's pretty secure so that's it that's all I can tell you and if you like this kind of stuff candy and related products look at the description for a playlist or search our chilli it's a melody pops in strawberry and look how happy that pop is

have a another continuation of our sour patch kids reviews we've been doing a few of those lately we are looking at sour patch kids watermelon that is right the first of the sour patch kids brands skew um that you know uh are not kids they're watermelons you know I was telling you last week I did a review of the sour patch kids tropical I was noting that it was interesting that at least here in Canada where we have a sour patch kids the may the Maynard's brand has been I sorry not the mainers brand but Maynard's is on it all too but the sour patch kids branding has been put on a bunch of different products including the sour cherry blasters the fuzzy peaches but I believe that watermelon I don't think that Mainers launched watermelons anything other than under Sour Patch Kids I think Maynard's I think the watermelons have always been Sour Patch Kids you guys feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in the comments below I I have never had this before and this product has been around for quite a while I I think it's God who have been at least for years maybe five years I it's been around for a while um yeah but but I've never had it um I don't usually seek out water moon stuff it's not that I always hate it I don't and I do like real watermelon but these are sour gummy watermelons just you know under the sour patch kids branding but like I said they're not kid shaped most of the other ones all the other ones I've reviewed here on this channel have been kid shaped I don't think it says anything of interest really here let's just break into them we don't need to you know draw it out too long here let's just have a look at these port also this packaging I not this packaging this bag in particular I'm not gonna ding it for that there wasn't a ton on the shelf when I got these and like the whole bottom of this bag this is like a big clump here they're all seem to be like fuse together I you know that that hat would could happen to anyone we're not gonna ding it on that you know a few of these are sort of intact to the way that I believe they are supposed to look Oh little green a little pink that's wait wait something's wrong that's not how a watermelon looks supposed to be green all around the outside wait a second wincing so it looks like there's a little green in pink on all of these but not very consistent in its patterning and design okay well forget that one those are really stuck there that looks kind of like green on the outside that's just like a dot of green mostly pink I know I mean I guess okay hold on what I'm trying to see is is the green in the same place like that green at least if the green was like on the outside of the circle I guess that's kind of on the outside of the circle then you can be like well it's the rind of the watermelon right there's no green on this one at all do the green does the green have a different flavor it shouldn't no it all should just taste like watermelon it's is this semantics or am I am I making way too much out of nothing guys what do you think cuz I am uncertain how far I should take this you know does it look like the product it's supposed to look like I'll tell you this that does not look like that really I mean it's close but it's not there's not a single one here that actually looks like a circle of green around a half circle of pink unfortunate let's get over it III wish they all had some green on them at least that would have been something let's get over and just give them a try though I'm expecting the leap totally fine it's our water Mon is this a flavor that you want to have that should exist not done a ton elsewhere let's try it oh okay ah it works hooray Oh guys yeah man honestly after the disappointment of the sour patch kids tropical I was really thinking that this was not gonna be a good idea flavors that on paper sound great pineapple fruit punch didn't really work didn't work for me at least watermelon on paper in my mind it's dicey that was dicey already but then again this products been around for years it's got its own packaging just for the one flavor that speaks volumes I would say that says this is a flavor that works you know and thank goodness it does guys it totally does the sour it's not overly sour maybe I don't know if sour patch kids do different levels of sour on their different products because this doesn't taste this sour as those tropicals did last week but maybe I'm just misremembering I think though what it really is is that the sour mesh's really well with the watermelon flavor to be fair it's not overly watermelon even like it's there it's there but it's also like it's like um it's not like you're a watermelon Jolly Rancher it's more like watermelon bubblegum where it's still kind of gum flavored it just has a little bit of watermelon on it you know this is mostly gummy sugar flavor little watermelon on it and a little sour on it not overly strong in the water mom not overly sour but a nice even even sort of sweetness throughout I got to say it works really well surprisingly well for someone who doesn't always tend to - watermelon flavored I think this has succeeded so I guess if you're a watermelon fan or a sour patch kids fan this is definitely recommend give it a whirl sour patch kids have a standard did I like to think that they always stay up and stay up - I would say that last week's review of sauerkraut kids tropical was my first kind of real disappointing sort of experience with the entire sour patch kids brand I'm really pleasantly surprised and happy that the sour patch kids watermelon has redeemed it so good for use to our patch kids I can certainly forgive a misstep with the tropical watermelon is good walking the candy aisle is gonna reach sour patch kids watermelon a very strong four out of five go check them out you know I'd still probably go for the sour patch kids original over this but you know to each his own if you're a watermelon fan give this a shot even if you're not I would recommend giving this a shot thanks very much for watching everyone stay tuned for next week's review we're gonna be doing the sour patch kids mango mango mango flavor that's the new one so uh yeah thank you all for your time and leave a comment let me know what you think in the comments down below alright so long everyone have a good one bye bye", "spJV3b7gFP4": "hey y'all

real baby bottle baby you can t juice baby bottle pops bring out the baby in you [Music]", "7Zq1ZrDpfxc": "hi everyone welcome to djenka toys and crafts today I'm gonna be looking at this make your own glow pops kit it's by Horizon group USA and it includes 5 glow sticks looks pretty cool and so I'm gonna see how this works ok so I opened it up and this is what it came with it has two packages of the lollipop mix one is yellow and one is red and they're actually gummy it says so I don't think they're gonna be hard lollipop so we'll see I kind of thought they're gonna be like hard suckers but I think they're gonna be more like gummy candy and then it came with ten of these lollipop sticks and two of these plastic holders and these are used to hold the glow sticks to make them glow and here is the tray for the mold and there are six different shapes on there and then also the glow sticks are in here so what you'd need to do to get started is have some warm water so I have some warm water here and then I have my mixing container just make it right here and the way you do it is you do two scoops of the mix to two scoops of the water so I think for my first one and it says you can mix them and make different colors or just multicolored ones so um I got this spoon here because I think would be easier to be scooping out the powder and also the water so I'm going to start with this cherry mix I think I will do that's so you can see it and I use this because I think would be easier to pour but actually kind of thick so I'm just gonna scoop it and stick it in this mold here okay so at this point you can decide if you're gonna make a regular lollipop or if you want to try one of the glue ones so I of course want to try one of the glow ones because I think that's gonna be really cool there so if you wanted you to just do a regular you just stick this right in there if you want to do one of the glue ones this is the special glow holder and so you just stick that in here okay guys so bad news here this is what it turned out and it actually turned out really well the gummy pop is is really smooth and it's nice and firm but when I was putting on this glow pop stick I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get it up there high enough and to be in there because you can see on the box here on the picture it has the little circle like right up there and I just couldn't understand because it just kind of popped right in there in the mold I'll show you that again and I was not understand that but anyway they realized that what I did was there are two different sides to the mold so you know you can't change the heart wound to do the glow stick on this side has actual spacing for the glow stick part so you would pop that in there and then the sucker would have been able to overcome fill that part and stayed on so unfortunately I didn't do that quite right but the way that you would use it for the glow is it has this end here and it just has like regular glow sticks you know that you buy like these that you just popped and then they start glowing and you would just do that and I'm not gonna do it right now just because this one was not didn't work out well and you would just stick that in there and it would glow and that would be really cool so the top just fell off of that so now I can show you a little better in fact if I had done it on the right side that this would have been here and the top would have been right inside of my lollipop so that's unfortunate but and the candy part turned out really well and I think it's really cool so I probably I'm not going to do a video on the glow part unless you guys really want me to if I get enough comments below that you actually want me to do another one of these and show you the glow stick part in there then I will do that but otherwise it turned out pretty well and just make sure that you use the right side of the mole so that's it for today thanks so much for watching hope to see you next time", "0bf4NtxIhNY": "hi everybody it's me Alicia Bunn thank you for coming back today and joining me we are going to be making some of this delicious kool-aid candy this is so fun and it's so good so let's get right into it first of all we're going to take a cup and a half of sugar and add it to a pan make sure you do not have your heat on just yet next I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch and I'm going to give that a stir and make sure my ingredients are mixed together pretty good you want your clean starch and sugar mixed together really good next I'm going to add a half a cup of light corn syrup and then I'm going to add 3/4 cup of water and give all of this a stir until your sugar is almost dissolved next I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of butter and then I'm going to turn my heat on medium and I'm going to let this slowly come to a boil you don't want to make this come to a boil too fast because you can you can burn where your sugar will burn a clown why's so I'll just let this slowly come to a boil you're going to need a candy thermometer I got this one at Michael's for about $4 and after your candy starts to boil you just want to stick it in and you want to let your sugar heat up to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit this is very important because this is what makes the consistency of your candy so you don't want to overcook it and you don't want to undercook it so 250 degrees Fahrenheit once it's reached 250 degrees Fahrenheit then you can turn your heat off and we're just going to move it off of the heat and I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm going to stir this really good until my vanilla is completely dissolved and then since I'm making three different flavors I'm going to separate this into three different bowls so I'm going to try to get it close to an even amount in each Bowl if I don't know well but my three flavors as you can see our orange blue raspberry lemonade and watermelon so after I have my bowls all distributed evenly then I'm going to pour my package of kool-aid into each one I use the whole package here but my candy turned out really really sweet it was really good but it was really sweet so I actually recommend only using half a pack for this amount of candy if you were going to do one full batch of what I did instead of separating it use a whole package but since I divided it into three separate parts I should have only used half a package of kool-aid so after you have your kool-aid in each Bowl then you're going to start each one until all of your kool-aid is dissolved completely you want the color to be bright and pretty and you want the flavor to be evenly distributed so all of your Chanti has that really good taste so I'm just going to mix this together really good and then I'm going to mix my blue one in my orange one as you can see here it's already starting to thicken up but you want to let this sit for about 15 minutes before you actually try to touch it because it is hot and it does cooled down but you don't want to burn yourself so here's a third of my flavors mixed together and they've been sitting for about 15 minutes so you can see on camera that even they look thicker now - so I'm just going to move them on to the side and place down some wax paper so that I don't make a mess all over my cabinet because this stuff gets really sticky so have to have my wax paper down I'm going to take some more butter if I'm just going to coat my hands with this stuff because this candy like I said it gets really really sticky and really messy so coating your hands with this butter is going to make it to where it kind of slides off your hands where I won't be sticking to your fingers and everything so give yourself a generous amount and cover your hands then I'm going to take my spatula and I'm just going to stir my candy and you can see here just how thick it is and after I see that it's thick enough to actually play with and give it a little touch and if it's cool enough to touch then go ahead and dig on in there and I'm just going to pull all this out and just start working it now I wish I got to show you the pink candy on camera but my battery died without me knowing so here's the blue one and the pink one looks exactly like the blue one you'll see it later but the consistency is really good I was really happy with the way it turned out I just have to keep adding a little bit of butter until it doesn't stick to my hands and I'm just working it and working it until it's firm and have to not drip all over the place this is a lot like the slime if you haven't seen that video I'll put it in the description below on how we made slime but it's a lot like the consistency of that here's my orange one and this turn got really good too I really like the colors it smells so good in here and I can't believe the taste it's just so so good incredibly sweet but really really good so after I got done with all my candy just for experimental purposes I had a few candy molds that I used and here are a few little flowers and I just stuck my Jandy down inside here and I stuck it in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes just to see if it would hold its shape so here they are cooled off and out of the freezer and I'm just gonna pop them out so you can see here how they turned out and I have to say I was really really excited and bummed that this picking time because they held their shape really good when I popped them out and I was so excited I thought they were gonna stay that way but sitting just in room temperature after a few minutes they started to turn into candy blobs so did not hold the flower shape but it was pretty cool to see that they did maintain the shape for a little while I think after a couple days if you would let them sit they'd hold their shape here my lollipops I did the same way in the mold refrigerated and then popped out then I actually kept these in the refrigerator and they stayed they held their shape the whole time until they got eaten behind my kids and then here are the stones I'm the same with them they really didn't make it past 24 hours but the time that they did sit in the refrigerator they held their shape pretty good so if you're not going to eat these right away I recommend keeping them in a cool nice and cool place but after a couple days this stuff does stiffen up and become like a real taffy candy so I hope that you enjoy it if you liked this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already if you want to see more videos like this later thank you so much and I can't wait to see you guys on the next video see you later bye", "2BKGYOsQ2Js": "hey guys stupid stick coming at you with another baby review I tried one different last time I didn't like it too much which is the update on that one is it's a lot better in a normal tank anyways I got bazooka sour straws going on the same brand but this one is watermelon flavor no one will give you a good review on it and tell me tell you what I think I can't get my seal going I can never get this like this subbu there we go let's cut the whole top off the box I love that cracking seal sound it smells really really good smells like like a watermelon lollipop or what happened watermelon candy in general you know what time it is time to get my cotton wet and I always liked these juice they're really smooth they have a great amount of VG in them it doesn't exactly say on the Box I don't believe but but it does because it's really smooth so the other one with a little harsh on the throat I'm hoping this one won't be the same results as the other two were fantastic I've actually seen a lot of reviews on this one and they say it's really good god

investigation we're in Bryan Ohio at the Spangler candy company where they make over 10 million dum-dums a day we're going to go check it out we're inside now actually mixture of sugar and corn syrup so back behind me you'll see the kettle were those two ingredients start to form the candy part of the demo from where we were at the mixing station the big batch rollers the magic candy just gets rolled and rolled and rolled until it gets into a small rope size before it gets shaped in to the dum-dum head so we'll see behind us here that the candy starts from a big ball and then it just turns into a really thin rope so we'll see it get more and the purpose of the vibrating shelf is that air can be easily distributed through the dum-dums so that they don't and thanks were to sit flat then they would form a flat side let's go dark shakin so once there once therefore you can see they go up above us there's a lot above us right now and then they're going to be wrapped into our signature fashion a rapper you tell Toby right now yep behind it you'll see where the dum-dums are inspected on a conveyer belt and then they're taken up into a Wayne funnel where they're weighed and dropped into the proper packaging sizes from here they're boxed up to be shipped out so and it'll be the box the box we can see them all done all right so now you know how these are made awesome thank you so much safety thanks everybody extend ler I've got my Jung gun and now you know how dum-dums are made", "DGIe1XpRQfI": "hello everyone today we're going to be making kool-aid dolly pops and so this is a recipe that I have made a couple times and I truly like this recipe because it works for me and it's easy to find the ingredients so basically all you need is water cooking spray corn syrup or honey sugar and one pack of kool-aid so I'm just gonna start off by taking my molds and I'm going to spray them with cooking spray just so when I put the lollipop sear up into the molds they don't stick so just like that I'm going to put that to the side now in a on a small saucepan I put half a cup of water in it with 1/3 a cup of corn syrup okay I'm just gonna pour the corn syrup and with the water you always want to make sure the water goes in first well that's what I always do just so I make sure I think sticks to the bottom of the pan okay oh I'm just gonna go put this in the sink okay so now I'm back um and I forgot to mention you're also gonna need some other supplies if you want to wrap it you're gonna need some pops I mean really pop sticks you're gonna need some cellophane bags and some twist ties and you can find the twist ties anywhere it's like you can game at the grocery store and this last thing is a little bit harder to find but you can find it at any craft store it's a candy thermometer and we're going to be needing that and so what I just did was I put I'm 1/3 cup of corn syrup into the water in the pan and I'm also going to add to that one cup of sugar white sugar and so this is a four sided four were these right into the pan so one two three four okay and we are just going to turn that on to high heat and let it boil um and stir it once and every once in a while real quick I just forgot to mention um once it starts to boil you want to turn it down to medium medium heat okay so I let this reach 300 degrees and I'm going to take the kool-aid and I'm going to put it in with the syrup that has been sitting for about five to ten minutes now and you want it to sit because the kool-aid will not be will not flavor it you don't let it sit long enough it'll actually um evacuate evaporate okay so I'm gonna pour these in time old okay everyone so I just poured it into my mold so that is what they look like and I prop them up normally stay up without a paper towel and just to ensure that the sticks are actually into the zero up and that's what I do I pop them up with a paper towel and so I'm gonna share with you some cleaning methods for this because this can be really really messy and it's hard to get up clean so I'm going to fill the pot with water and I'm going to put this on the stove again and this helps the syrup um sort of get into the water um I'm just gonna put that on um heat again so the syrup actually goes into the water and it makes it a lot easier for cleaning um Wow our lowly pops sit okay so I took a pot of water and I'm putting on the stove and I just did this method because it takes about two times for it actually get all of it off and so after you get some of it off the first time just put more water back in it until um it's clean I guess and so I'm gonna go call the cops right here and I'm just going to take out these little things then I put underneath them I'm staying up because at this point your lollipops should be pretty solid um I wouldn't touch them yet because they're still in their hardening stage so this is what it should look like when your water oops when your water is boiling it should be red or whatever color your kool-aid was and that's the sign that the kool-aid is actually wearing off on the from the pan into the water and so in a couple minutes I'm going to take this pot and just going to dump it down the drain and I might have to do this method one or two more times but this is the only way that I've used to get this off so I know it works so I'm just gonna turn the heat off I'm going to go pour this into this thing and at this point or after the next time you boil your water it should be easy enough to scrape off the side and so I'm just gonna let this sit with more water in the pan on the high key again for a minute or so just so we can get the last little bit off of the pan okay so oops sorry for that um I finished cleaning up my pan um now I've made this only times that I have designated a special pot for me to use because some of it doesn't always come out and so so I still have like a little bit of syrup from every time I've made all it helps in it which is fine by me because it was a small pot that we don't use at all and so I'm just going to take my molds at this point this should be hard I'm just going to flip them over and I'm going to gently pop them out and so it shouldn't take too much I hurt to get them out just so this is one of all the props that you know and it's a dragonfly a little son I think so a bumblebee and so my molds are like just molds that I got from joining fabrics and I got them and say oh I think they were like $2 but um they're only like four but you don't need to keep buying new molds if you always clean them and stuff so yeah and I'm gonna show you how to wrap them actually so I usually take these um let me see if I can find it um I can't find the wrapper for it but um there are like little old bags and they're like I think there's so things it's all the thing Thanks but they work really well for my lollipops because they fit really nicely inside them but I think they make different sizes too so you can choose which size fits through all the tops best but basically I just put it in and I wrap up the end just like this and I put it this high round it and I got gold twist ties um this time so that's what it ends up looking like and I think it looks really professional and I'm actually going to start selling these because I've made so many so I'm just gonna show you some my other products that I made and these are my honey lollipops and I'm actually making these for my grandma because she has cancer and her throat is always sore and Scratchy and so the honey actually really helps my mom was sick once um a couple weeks ago and she had a really sore throat and this helps for like in it it helped coat your throat so she could eat right after and it yeah she said it helped for about 30 minutes after you you're done eating it and these are some of my other kool aid lollipops and I made this with the mixed berry which are one of my favorites with and yeah I haven't tried this flavor yet so should be interesting so I'm just gonna finish wrapping these real quick I'm going to be starting a new series and this is gonna be in the new series on my channel and I'm it's gonna be a food channel because I love baking and I love anything to do with baking so I'll be filming all the things I make and all the recipes so you can turn making onto and maybe you like baking as much as I do after you watched on my videos but yeah I'm trying to think well um I will list all oh like the prices of the products down below if I have a chance but I'll mean the right now just so you know the solo fan was about two dollars for a pack of 15 the twist ties were a doll or something for 50m and you want to get the same um same amount of the twist ties and the bags so that way you don't have to twist ties or too many bags and not enough of one of the other um throw a lollipop sticks want tips fun too and I got all my supplies at dry and dry hand fabrics so I'm just going to finish wrapping them and I will show you the finished product this is a finished product of the kool-aid lollipop now I would really like to see if you guys make these lollipops so if you watch this video and if you have an Instagram or Twitter do hashtag cooler the light pops with Maddy and so that way I can see all of your lovely creations with this recipe because you can do so many things with them and yeah so I'm going to try it this is definitely my new favorite", "9YA3DJx71_c": "[ACandyStore Bulk Candy] >> Valerie M.(from Lusby, MD): Hi ACandyStore.com.

right into this thing you already opened it how did you open it oh you just went like this like a bag of cheese okay so holy okay so it doesn't look anything like the packaging i know i think the lollipop just looks like a massive dookie on a stick my guys so it doesn't work on the top not at all so not even from the bottom like on the packaging you can see that there's a hole put it on the bottom and there's no hole so here we go let's just get right into it ready three two one yup oh oh it's so hot and sour can't hop kind of just all went down my throat tastes pretty good i like it i

pretty yes it nasty to me it is it just looks like tahin yeah that's the powder for the lollipops that you dip the lollipop in pretty good it's pretty nasty to me where would your rating be no i'll give it a five out of ten i would give it a six and a half it's not the best it burns my lips yeah it's pretty hot for a lollipop it doesn't remind me like anything of a taki i don't know but you're just a giant blob tastes like a hot lollipop any mexican lollipop actually this is what it tastes like okay so yeah this one looks like tahin just more grounded up because look it's like finer than baking here it is and then we're just gonna dip it again uh i don't really like the powder but the lollipop's okay okay so i brought myself some water so i could try to get the powder off because it literally just started in the package with the powder on that so guys i'm gonna explain something to you guys the reason we haven't been uploading a lot is because quarantine i've been doing is

see you guys in the next one", "1zZV8VnNShI": "okay fellow youtubers this is DM Blair wolf and today's video is gonna be on this tiny little green lollipop well I was at the Harrisburg East Mall yesterday and a friend of mine Ted owns the supplemental store east coast supplements in there and he got these they're called chronic Tandy what it is is it's got ten milligrams of CBD and it has o G cush terpenes in it so it's an all-around wellness candy okay but as small as it is in this little city CBD it has in it I think it might be more geared towards like little kids maybe for like seizures or or a DD or even just wellness in some way because ten milligrams isn't a lot for an adult I would think cuz I personally need it probably the whole case of pops to be okay because I think it comes with like twenty or so in a case so I would probably need two or three hundred milligrams of this stuff but we're gonna open it up we're gonna try it out and see what it tastes like and see if we can get any you wouldn't get any wellness out of it okay so just give me a moment I'll rip this sucker open and we'll see what's in it cheers pop first off Wow I smells like an OG plant rate right allogram holy moly doesn't seem to be any low chunkies or anything yet so I guess it's just straight candy that's like flavor right off that's like you stuck the whole plant right in your mouth holy moly [Music] it tastes good yeah yeah I think it tastes great there's definitely terpenes in it you can taste them right off the candy itself has room it was sort of a like a sweet flavor to it I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel something well I was gonna get to that I actually even though it's only 10 milligrams I definitely feel calmer and that was just a little lick that I did well or someone who doesn't ingest or take CBD in a lot the sights a little bit could probably be you know you'll probably be beneficial do you like calming or making you are relaxed be another thing like your kids run around the house bouncing off the walls like a Gibbon throwing Legos everywhere you've been one of these little pops be like your kid you know son daughter child have a lollipop it's definitely appeasing in flavor I mean like the more I eat it the more I want to eat it I mean totally is when I was a kid I probably just want to ask for another that like definitely is like peanuts chronic candy is that it definitely has a a sense of appeal in its flavor okay like I can say that like if I were to take like marijuana or so forth and put it in my mouth I would be like this definitely has flavor and I could say that when you do it if you don't continuously lick it it goes away like I felt something but now because I ain't continuously doing it yeah it's not doing anything anymore yeah you probably have to ingest a whole pot like it's supposed to be one dose but one does for who wonder what type of people would benefit from this like I said like maybe like people with seizures because CBD supposed to be great for seizures and focusing concentrating relaxation just watch them move like children it's a pop yeah ten milligrams I feel it but I don't think it'll last long not for me cuz I'm you know kids like fifth my size it'd probably be like hey I'm ready to watch Sesame Street hey bring on the spongebob I'm ready for cartoons is it snack time yet so let's go through our daily thing here first we'll say that one one two five one being and five being presentation what it looks like what definitely looks appealing ain't a person in the world unlike a pop so due to four and a half it was a little bit bigger around maybe a five because then it'd be more appealing flavor would it taste like right off the bat man it's like you put the whole plant in your mouth so I give this sucker a five color I'm not so big on the color could have been yellow like a lemon maybe put some kind of flavor in it just not just strength terpenes in the CBD but you definitely know it's in there effectiveness I feel it I don't feel it like like when I used like the flowery products like the CBD blunt or the bubble bag hash and that's a BAM in your face you're you know I'm medicated this is just an underlining feeling that definitely is calming and medically it's good so those three things combined and the price is nice um I was giving this one for free to try it but if I remember correctly on the box here were like two bucks apiece I think I think there was like 10 or 20 in the box and he had like two or three more boxes you could just maybe buy a whole box for 20 bucks or something it's probably gonna be a big deal especially for since I work here at that new Nannan it's [ __ ] stressful working in there sometimes cuz there's definitely a cultural gap so being able to calm down and being able to focus yeah I'm sterile these are your mouth at work no probably never know I know so if you have any questions or comments if you've tried these before or you know a different flavor or a different company or a place where you can Vicki's wholesale or even ones that are stronger 20 I think a 50 milligram one of these would definitely be more adult in a in a in a dose cuz I know when you buy just like the hemp bombs those pills are like three pills for 60 milligrams total you take all three of them pills you know you took them so if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down below thumbs up like subscribe comment comment comment meanwhile while you're commenting I'm gonna finish this lollipop so till next time guys have a great calming relaxing medicated day", "oXvq31sHjGw": "a while back I did juicy-fruit and they had like the sour patch flavor that juicy fruit made I was in a while was a store haven't been in

of doing tricks with my and my BMX bike man when I when I stole a pair of pegs from Bradley's back on days kids y'all know about Brad he's way ahead of your time man but Bradley's was like a k-mer or

mine so yeah to my shame I stole the pair of pegs kids do not try that don't do that yeah I'm saying you gonna get caught and it ain't worth it cuz I got nad security before you ain't had no security

know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope

tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an O a V and E a y OU and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they could also twist rods into lollipops", "NMQOVnLvGSc": "[Music] hey everybody I wanted to use you to Alva she works in our library Department first thing you do

"e7Yf7ykZVt8": "hey everyone I'm whole from all in Ha club and today we are going to be making chocolate suckers yay suckers and chocolate so these are super fun because they are perfect for any holiday any occasion because of what you can top them I mean you can put like candy corn for Halloween and Christmas stuff whatever that is for Christmas or just like you know you need to meet the chocolate they're great alone let's go so what we're going to be needing money stickers are there some chocolate chips or some chocolate melt in any shape color form chop think we're going to need some popsicle sticks or some sucker sticks or some bob sticks or and it kind of sick that you can find today it's a parchment paper in Ziploc baggie and then any kind of topping that you can think of anything so we're going to start by pouring our chocolates into a microwavable bowl and then we're just going to microwave it in 30 second increments and stirring it in between each 30 seconds until it is completely melted now we're just going to scoop all the chocolate into our plastic baggie and then cut a teeny corner off the plastic bag that was where you get to be creative and just have fun so all we're doing is just squeezing the chocolate out of the bag in some random formation however you would like to do that you can make them as pretty or as wild as wood like and now we're just going to appreciate our popsicle sticks and then cover them up with chocolate now before our chocolate sets up go ahead and add your toppings I've done marshmallows sprinkles crushed graham crackers crushed pretzels and eminem's and now you can either just let them sit there and set up or speed up the process and throw them in the freezer lets your chocolate is firm you should be able to just pop those right off the parchment paper and they are good to go and there you have your cute and yummy suckers all ready to go thank you guys so much for watching to be sure to check back next week for another video and I will see you next time I", "qu-99YgAp0I": "heyyou Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary and I was thinking we could melt down these ring pops and make a little edible ring pop so we're gonna crush these down I think in the bag we're just gonna break them all up it broke already so we can keep the Ring Pop and make a mold so we have a THC ring puff so here's the plan melt these down add the RSO to the melted mixture I think I can use this as a Ring Pop mold and pop it right out but let's be honest if that doesn't work I have some backup molds we'll make it work let's melt this down also I might add a little weed oil as well I know all of you guys love working with are so or distillate and just putting it right in the mixture but I love a good flower oil so we're gonna put this and then here's the weed oil obviously we're not gonna put all of this in we're gonna put some of it in the biggest thing that I would stress is to have everything all set up and ready to go you don't want to be fumbling for it and like [Music] adding some powdered sugar to the inside of the bigger who you so that we don't have the biggest lollipop ever I don't know wish me luck all right I just came up with a better way to make my mole put the powdered sugar in here [Music] made a mold always heat these up I like to put it under hot water in a cup it needs to be warmed up before you open this you just don't want to break the plungers in they're done [Music] I have the RSO sitting in hot water well that RSO is soaking in the hot water so that it blew in [Music] we can still use it well I still think we can make sure it comes to the plan one more time to ring pops we're gonna melt it on the stove medium-low more towards low watch your stone once it's melted down that's when we're gonna get that are so I'm gonna put it in open maybe just a little weed oil no once this is all melted all mixed together all the THC added I'm gonna try to pour it into those molds we mean then we're gonna try to put the ring pop back on them this will kind of take a while to melt down so I'm gonna speed it up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I think it's freaking working [Music] I mean it's ugly but it is a ring pop I have to quick run though the dispensary but when I get back we'll do a taste test all right now it's time for the taste test so we have our ring pop [Music] [Music] so it may not look exactly like a ring pop but it also doesn't not look like a ring pop happy medicating meltdown your candy do it [Music] this was a lot less suspicious if you're gonna bring it somewhere to say [Music]", "7P9-wsy1ix4": "hi my name is bethany beck and i'm going to be teaching you how to make candy with honey all right let's get started so first who am i my name is bethany beck as i've already covered i am not a beekeeper yet although eventually i would love to i recently graduated at covenant college my passions are plants as you can see behind me bees and the environment i am huge on all three and how did i get the idea to make candy with honey um this is kind of weird i love to cook but i never really tried anything with candy until i started playing a certain game of dnd with my friends um if you're unfamiliar with the game basically you make your own character and then you play that character with your friends you fight villains etcetera etcetera it's all in the imagination and my character that i created she was a beekeeper which was so much fun and one of the things that she did as an act of kindness is everyone she kind of came across she would give a honey lollipop and eventually after playing for this character for about a year i was like you know what i should actually try and make these uh so i looked up some recipes i've researched some and i finally found something that i liked made them and then i brought them to my group and they loved them i brought them to bee club and everyone there loved them and then somehow i'm here and i have an etsy page so um don't like if you want to just buy my lollipops not make them then you're more than welcome to do that uh my edgy page is called bex honeysuckers and yeah it's super great all right so let's get into it what you're going to need as far as tools goes you're going to need a measuring cup tablespoons pot a basting brush molds stick and a candy thermometer if you don't have a mold and you want to try it out for the first time one of the things that you can do is take a flat pan fill it with powdered sugar and then take like a cup and make indents into the powdered sugar and then put your sticks in it kind of works as a mold i haven't tried it myself but i know it works from research but i will say the molds that i use these guys are only 2.99 from hobby lobby and there are every other week they are 30 off so it's pretty easy and they're also reusable so you can use them as many times as you want um and then i do want to specify if you're going to do this you need to use a candy thermometer there are some people that can do it without but it is very difficult to know when it's reached the proper temperature and it is very vital that you take it off the temperature as soon as it hits that so i really suggest using a candy thermometer now the ingredients you're going to need sugar which all of you should have you're going to use some light corn syrup honey and water and then additionally if you want to add flavoring that's totally totally optional all right now here's the recipe i will go ahead and let everyone write it down you can take a picture of the screen it's pretty simple 2 cups of sugar 1 4 cup of water two thirds a cup of light corn syrup and two tablespoons of honey um i videoed this because i've already done that and i just want to get into how to make it once we get there and a lot of people look at how much honey there actually is in this and they're very surprised um and i will say you can make these only using honey but to be honest it's a waste of money because honey is gold and using a lot of honey to do this would be kind of crazy so it is much better especially for the structure and the smoothness if you just go ahead and follow this recipe in addition you can also use different flavorings for the batch that i'm going to be making today with you guys i am doing one tablespoon of honey a few drops of essential oil and a tablespoon a little splash of lavender syrup which i'll get into all right so the directions first you want to prepare your molds do this before you even touch any of the ingredients because if you try and do this later you are going to regret it again i got these at hobby lobby pretty cheap you can also find them on amazon um i like the ones that are flat and circular just because they're really simple and you're going to want to make sure that these sticks are about halfway into where the lollipop will be that just gives it a good structure before you even touch the ingredients again make sure your molds are all prepped up and that you have placed a stick in every single mold because there's nothing worse than pouring your sugar and realizing half of your molds don't have sticks in them and real quick i'm going to go ahead and show you what it looks like um so i have this set up so that the edges are covering each other so that there is no table shown that's a really good trick for not getting your counter super messy um i am going to talk about cleanup a little bit later um but it is just easier not to have the mess to clean up in the beginning um and then you can use pam if you would like to keep the the mold really well greased um it's not necessary though so you know i just kind of avoid it because why why waste that money alrighty so the next step is going to be take all of your ingredients and put them in the pot i've already done this because i wanted to make it easier for us to go ahead and make them and when you do put all the ingredients in you're going to make sure you give it a nice stir because this is going to be the only time you stir i made this mistake several times but it is best once you've got your ingredients in just to let it sit and then you're going to put over medium-high heat i've been doing this for a while so i'm going to go ahead and put it over high heat the medium-high heat just to allow you the time to kind of observe and make sure it doesn't get out of hand and then one thing that you really need to do is take a basting brush and some water and then just go around the rim on the inside and use that water to kind of wipe away any of the sugar that might be on the edges this is incredibly important because the way sugar works if sugar comes in contact with sugar crystals it will start to crystallize um when it gets to the point that you're pouring and it comes in contact with that then you're gonna end up with lollipops that are really rough on the tongue and not very fun to eat so it is best to make sure that you're wiping the edges as you cook it's not gonna affect the sugar or anything it's just gonna make sure that that crystallization doesn't happen alrighty so you're going to make that sit you're going to let that sit until it starts to [Music] thicken and then you're also going to use your candy thermometer and you're just going to add it on the side and i generally mine doesn't stick very well to the pot but i just kind of like to prop it in and just let it sit there alright so you're going to put your candy thermometer in and you're going to keep an eye on the temperature as soon as it hits 300 degrees fahrenheit you have to work quickly so it is very important to keep your eye on that temperature i will say though it will take a little while to get up to 300 degrees fahrenheit alrighty it is getting pretty close to being 300 so i'm going to add a few last things i'm going to add a few drops of lavender essential oil and a few drops of food coloring i'm going to it is hit 300 so i'm going to turn off the heat i'm going to pour it into a separate pan that i used for pouring these which i'll show you in just a second there's this pan it has a lip and then i'm going to submerge it in an ice bath and i'm not going to let it i'm just kind of letting it sit there until it stops bubbling as hard just calming down quite a bit so i'm going to go ahead and wipe the rim and right now i'll go ahead and show you this is how it kind of looks it's purple because i added that food coloring and i apologize for adjusting the camera so much but we have to work quickly because again this waits for no one and you're just going to pour it into each one of the molds and as you see as i'm pouring it is quite bubbly it will lose some of those bubbles once it's cooling um but some of them actually do stay and it kind of looks pretty cute so i don't mind it and optional you could add things like glitter um or like gold leaf or you know any like dried flowers some people do that you prep your molds in the first place you can just place it on the bottom below the stick so that when you pour it in it's going to look really good and it won't mess with it you can also add toppings on top of it but because this is such a time sensitive thing most of the time by the time you're finished pouring and you get back to putting toppings on those first lollipops they're already hardened so i don't recommend doing that i'm glad i added that food coloring so you guys can see how it looks alrighty so once you saw once it hit 300 degrees fahrenheit it is fast and quick work um there is not much time to kind of talk about the directions so i'm going to do that now again once it hits 300 you're going to remove it from the heat and you're going to submerge it in an ice bath the point of that is to make sure it does not go any higher than 300 degrees fahrenheit once it does it starts to become caramel and you can't really work with it and then you're just going to leave it in there to the point where the bubbles have really calmed down and it stopped boiling then you're going to pour each lollipop as carefully as you can try not to get things to spill really give each mold your your undivided attention because it is very easy to have a lapse of judgment and overfill or spill it's not a big deal but it's just you know it's a waste of that wonderful candy um and then you're gonna let them sit for about five minutes to cool um and then once they're finished cooling you can wrap or enjoy them right there um so yeah it's pretty simple straightforward um again i would not do this with kids because it is very dangerous working with hot candy but it's still pretty fun so kids could watch i just wouldn't suggest them doing this part of the they can mix the ingredients that would probably be the only thing i'd let them do all right now we're going to talk about additional flavorings um as you saw i do have this infused syrup that i use i made it using lavender this is food grade that i ordered online so i know it's really good and pure and i can send that recipe to anyone that wants it if you just shoot me an email i will have my email at the end and then you can also use things like essential oils as far as this goes i really really suggest you only use one or two drops i think i accidentally used four in this batch but i would say that's probably too strong because essential oil is good in very small amounts when it comes to food but if you do too much it is not good for your health so please make sure you only use small portions of that and then you can also do flavoring and coloring um when you are buying these make sure that they are only meant for food um again with like essential oils it might be tempting to use the cheap stuff that you can find on the shelf of any store but really make sure that you're getting it from a good place that it knows it's for food i'm not sure what the health risks are there but i i wouldn't want to mess with them i use lori anna oils lauren's makes food coloring they make all oils they make flavorings and they they make a lot of stuff specifically for candy making so that is a really good source um and then if you do end up using food coloring make sure that you use a water-based food coloring not a gel because that's not going to work as well in a mixture like this alright then i wanted to also give you guys a little instruction about reusable wraps so one thing that i like to do just as a fun little additive is wrap my lollipops in these beeswax wraps just kind of adds another layer to the fun so your supplies for this you are going to need fabric cut into five by five inch squares that's just what i found has worked for me you're gonna need a hanger with a tiny clothespin you could probably use normal size but i use tiny so you are going to need a pan that you don't use for cooking i got this at goodwill for super cheap and it works really well especially because it has this really thick bottom so it retains that heat really well and then you're going to use some really good high quality wax shout out to harold lanier because this wax is gold it's amazing all right i'm going to go ahead and readjust and then we'll make these real quick so for this we're only going to use a very low heat again because my pan has a really thick bottom it's going to retain that heat so i'm not going to have to do i might even cut off the heat while i'm doing this just because it doesn't need it you are going to let it warm up so you're just going to melt a little bit of that wax and set that aside for later and you're going to take your fabric and just drape it into the wax let it soak it up again you only want a very thin coat of the wax you don't want it to be super thick i'll show you why in just a minute once it has absorbed all of the wax you're going to turn off your heat and this is the part where normally i have my hanger hanging on something and i just pin it to the clothespin um but i don't have anything to hang it on so i'm just going to hold it and i'm going to go ahead and tell you why you don't want to do a super thick coat of this wax so i have found that if you do a really thick coat of wax it makes this very like crinkly and the wax will come off whereas thinner coats are way more durable which you wouldn't think but that's how it is and easier to use and wash all right so it is already done it's not quite fully dry but it's dry enough that i can set it aside and i'll go ahead and show you two how i wrap them all right so now i'm going to show you how to wrap these in the reusable wraps we just made so this is the lollipop i just made it is gorgeous i might have taken it out a little bit too early because you might can tell it's a little warpy but that's okay it for now that's fine all right so you're gonna take your wrap and you're gonna center the lollipop right in the middle so it's gonna look like that then you're gonna take the other end and fold it over the lollipop and kind of squish the side down so it molds and then you're going to take the corner fold it downwards so it's going to look like that and then fold the bottom corner upwards so it's going to look like that all right and then what you're going to do is do the exact same thing but for the opposite side so again i'm bending it downwards like that and then bending it upwards like that all right now it still looks a little wonky but this is the fun part you're just going to twist it and then the way the wax works is it molds together and you can reshape that as you need and it looks gorgeous so that's the main purpose that i use the wax wraps for all righty and i'm just going to say this real quick if you do end up making these make sure that you only ever wash them with cold water and a mild soap and make sure that whoever you do give them to knows that because if you wash it with warm water the wax is going to go away all right so these are examples of some of the things that i use these wraps for they are quite small so honestly there's not a whole lot that you can use them for but you can use them for just preserving produce for covering up mugs but the main thing i use them for these lollipops all right now before i end my presentation i do want to go over how to clean up because this is a very messy task your best friend when cleaning up is going to be hot water and soap helps as well but hot water is the key here when you've got your pan that still has a pretty thick coating of that sugar on the bottom because it is going to solidify while you're pouring go ahead just add fresh water to that and then you're going to put it on high heat and you're going to add just a few dollops of soap and now you're just going to let it sit you're going to let that sit for i would probably do a good 20 minutes it takes a long time for that sugar to kind of dilute in the water that you're boiling so definitely just sit let that sit and forget about it once it's finished boiling and you've kind of can tell that all the sugar has reincorporated all you have to do is pour it down the sink it has saved so much time to do it this way and it's fantastic um same with cleaning your molds you are just going to use hot water and soap there shouldn't be too much of a cleanup as far as the molds go because i'll pull one over here you can see where i spilled a lot it just breaks off so as far as cleaning that goes you mostly just have to break off the sugar and then if you have any spots that you spilled on the counter or on the eye of the stove it is a little bit more tricky to clean that up again boiling water is your best friend here so make sure that you have boiling water and then i usually use a rag and some soap but again boiling water is the key and yeah it's pretty easy to clean up if you just kind of let it sit for as long as you can um it's not that difficult and because i use two pots there's a little bit more cleanup but it's not too bad all righty thank you so much for joining me and learning how to make these suckers i hope that you try it out and enjoy them i am so sorry that i'm not able to send everyone some for our conference i was really looking forward to that um but you can try my honeysuckers if you want by going to my etsy page which is beck's honeysuckers alternatively you can also send me a text with my phone number or shoot me an email and if you have any questions about this i'm going to be answering some questions afterwards but

right away because I kind of wanted to beep it and described it as I gave it to you like I said on the bottle you can kind of tell it's a bubblegum vape but the actual flavor profile on this is a cantaloupe melon bubblegum now if you're unaware or unfamiliar with the this type of flavor a big Japanese flavor people in Japan they've been eating like these chewy gummies chewy candies since the 1930s I think they were called chew let's back then and then in about 1975 this company called a marinara mary mary naga came out in 1975 and reintroduced that same flavor but in a high chew it was it was called haiku so it's like a chewy candy they also have tons of these and bubble gum form over in Japan honestly it tastes just like those like not even kidding you it tastes like a cantaloupe and I'm pretty sure they just say melon but I'm pretty sure that means watermelon because that's I'm picking up like a sweetness of watermelon from this so I believe it is a cantaloupe watermelon bubblegum this is a hugely popular thing over in Japan you can find them all over the internet they're all over the place in Japan and on the internet here you can order them and stuff really really tasty but back to this e-liquid let's give you the quick flavor profile on shi gens website it says melon ball is perfect for those vape enthusiasts looking for a bubblegum vape this e-liquid isn't just your average bubblegum flavor though we at Shin Jin vapor took it a step further and added our special touch and made it a cantaloupe melon Japanese bubblegum this vape will taste just like the

you're going through a lollipop and it has that nasty like kind of like chalky outer coating and this one got [ __ ] all over extra pieces of gum on the outside extra pieces of candy I don't know if you can see there you can't see it but I went alone bowling last night I didn't Bowl but I watched a football and what's well arcade and then this was like one of the prizes the candy I got a bump to candy last night I got a video I did with me eating some nectarines [Music] Colossians and other people you know well then they ass in my videos and all that well let me go ahead and do this too because they were about to go bad and I had like four of them so I was like I might as well make a video as you can see it's not like a real-ass channel but I just post videos whenever I want to I

if I had given it shredding I would give it like a 2 or 3 it's not that good but it's okay well humm mm-hmm yes I'm not doing that nope nope ease up there this hmm okay so that's what we have two guys

Arkana fam and welcome back to another product review video just for you guys so check it out for this video right here I have some more edibles alright so these are the drops these are lime drops and these are 50 milligrams of THC each I got two of them so we got 100 milligrams total which I already know I already know some of you me be viewing this like hundred grams as [ __ ] that's just done a lot that's weak sauce yeah okay I agree with you but really quick just to let everybody know 50 grams is the limit here on our edibles in the state of Oregon okay so if your recreational 21 and up you have a limit of 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy you know five six seven of these you know what I mean but you're still limited to 50 milligrams and it's kind of rather expensive to be honest for just 50 okay I mean these were like 6 or 7 bucks a box for just 50 milligrams you know what I mean so you can see how that kind of adds up alright but anyway so these are a lime jelly okay both of these are a lime jelly and I believe they're just bite size let's see here a point or 0.8 percent or whatever 0.8 grams percent grams of sugar and no fats no no cool all right lime essential oil oil and cannabis extract and cannabis deprived terpenes okay okay this is balanced okay so right here let's see if I can show you guys this better right there they tell you the so if you just take one of those little slivers out of this that's five milligrams so if you're trying to dose yourself out they got a little dosage chart right there as soon as you open it up so you can get ten servings you can cut out of this five milligrams each serving okay for a total of 50 milligrams all right I don't know why I keep saying balanced on there it says balanced balanced like what the [ __ ] okay great you're balanced I'm not at least I'll try not to be here we go [Music] [Music] super line like super lime like holy [ __ ] that is a rush of lime flavor it's very nice it's got this covered in sugar so the code of sugar really adds to it it tastes great it nice and soft it's not like a hard gummy I like it this is a vegan product it does say vegan right there so if you are somebody that is vegan this is going to work perfect for you okay [Music] hmm you kind of get that taste of cannabis right there at the end the aftertaste you can you definitely taste a little smidgen of weed in there but overall it's got a nice flavor it tastes really good it tastes just like a candy I mean it tastes like a lime gummy candy and it's really good it's not bad um I actually like this product I actually like it I'll give it a thumbs up I give it a definite thumbs up I would definitely recommend it and the reason I recommend it is because you here in Oregon since it's 50 milligrams for each meaning if you want more you got to buy more so when you're buying more if you're buying ones that are like huge chunks of candy or huge chunks of chocolate or whatever the [ __ ] that's a lot of sugar that you have to [ __ ] intake just to get the milligrams that you need okay or what that's crazy okay I'm not trying to be diabetic so the fact that it's bite-sized the fact that it's just one little quick all right and I got my full 50 milligrams that's awesome I love that alright so let me know about your guys's opinions on the drop here let me I dropped it let me pick up the drop on the drop alright drops cannabis jellies that's that's the name of this company be sure to check out the drops cannabis jellies if you've ever had this product let me know your thoughts and

going to be doing drama please trying these new lip pops that i got that my mom got for me at dollar tree and they look pretty good and i'm super excited to try them so there is a unicorn one there is um i think there's a slop and that's a mermaid and probably i think that might be an alligator or oh it's a dragon dragon and i'm super excited and they also have names or sleepy pearly fiery and magical one i think i'm not sure what that is it looks like a unicorn or something i don't know but let's open them and try them i'm super excited to try these so i'm going to open up these got it open then this one is i think this one's pearly fiery because it has oh this is sleepy actually i think this is this is probably the unicorn one and this one is this was fire so i'm going to show you guys um i'm going to eat which one should i eat first i'm going to eat this one oh they have little phones on the middle i think that's adorable open this one got it right before it hit the ground here i go blue raspberry this one's blue raspberry mmm this is good i love this this one's blue raspberry and it tastes pretty good and this one's pretty good i love this one um we got a napkin or tissue i'm gonna just put that down i think that one the blue roster was pretty good i think i'm gonna try hmm i'm gonna try sleepy because uh i think this might be green apple i don't know or it could be something nasty i don't know let's just see yes it is green apple mmm that's good that's good i love that one that one wasn't pretty good as you said the raspberry was good the green apple was pretty good too let's see we have two more left hopefully hopefully these two are good hopefully i give them a thumbs up and not a thumbs down because i want a thumbs up let's let's do this one i think this is fiery and um it has a phone on it i like the way the phone is detailed [Music] i don't know which this one is this might be strawberry or something cherry i don't know that's good then my strawberry that's strawberry oh that's so good hopefully the last one's good this one is pearly and it looks so oh i think i want to i think i'm going to probably eat this one because this is the last one and i think i'm going to like this one the most i like the lips the most see um i'm trying to see the wrapper i don't know which one this is well i checked and this one is watermelon well this one will be kind of in the middle because it doesn't it doesn't taste like a watermelon that much i would give this one a thumbs down it does not taste like watermelon but i love the lips that's the most thing i like a lot um my favorite is probably let me taste this some of them again but i don't remember how what they taste like that's a good apple let's taste this oh it's sticky i'll try to pull that off got it that was blue raspberry um that the one i mostly like we see and the one i mostly like the most has to be the green apple the green apple is so good and they add a lot of flavor to it it makes it has the most flavor and the other one does the other ones don't really have that much strawberry or blue raspberry kind of taste to them so green apple and i should say strawberry pretty good strawberry is actually pretty good on that one that one has a lot of taste but it's hard to taste them when you eat a lot of other flavors and it mixed up it tastes kind of weird but i loved the strawberry and green apple and hopefully you guys can try these ones because they're super duper good well thank you guys for watching playtime with treasure bye", "RE5UJCz1CPU": "[Music] other advice today on the burger view I will be eating a scorpion pop technically I probably our play won't be eating the screw up the actual pop part of it too much I'm covers and get a couple licks which I'll do now that is a scorpion cuz it picking it up are the blurriness flurry minutes of course we'll just show picture I mean you can put it up close again I'll focus it yeah that is a real scorpion impatient pure amber yep and well banana banana burner but yeah this is from a hot licks I believe as the company's name and they make these kind of like novelty candies so I'm gonna go ahead and Link this and see if see if it's any good God and if you'll remember can I be in this place it's really blurry it came from Jamie Eriksen as part of our fan mail and bartson that we had recited and we we know we elected to hang on to the Scorpion Pavan till we could lick to the to its juicy center but truthfully I don't think I'm gonna do that we have actually a saucepan over here we're gonna melt this sucker so I can just get it straight like scorpion because that just takes too long and you're not very entertaining yeah I've looked it have you looked at every side of it no to look every side of it have you looked every side of it already except for this one yeah now I see the Scorpion it grossed me out now I'm gross though are you gonna have it pretty much okay bang boy oh it's delicious it's really good to me no I mean I like banana okay it seems like it's something that would get old real real quick and watching other people hope I let you know when they out they're just gonna like yeah it's old so I'm gonna go ahead and throw it in the saucepan we're gonna try to get straight to the score creams gonna do that number that is immediate it's not picking up pretty well we're gonna get straight to the score pin I'm gonna eat this sucker and I'm not even a scared I think I'm okay with this let's get this I'm gonna pretend this like a little shrimp it's a little shrimp that I'm eating a little scorpion shrimp everything in this pan is gonna taste like banana Blair no I'm already kind of like feeling a little nauseated almost stomach has nothing to do with a scorpion and just stomachs a little acting up so I hope this doesn't make it any worse so now I'm pretty fast actually it's getting this getting down to it fact I'm about to turn it down just a little bit probably have to wash this skillet like them immediately to keep that candy from yeah oh dude it's gonna get real real sticky I can't get it to turn around just trying to lift it up and are you using a plastic fork well obviously I mean by the reef the reason I did that was actually pretty honest I didn't want to pick up the Scorpion warning your Forks then you have scorpion on it but I guess look at scorpion right everything just froze scorpion oh my games and everything I'm gonna say rumps scorpion on your dig I'm scorpion on my deck that's what I'm gonna use the hot sauce for okay this is getting there this is getting there super fast yeah let me let me get me a bullet go ahead gonna play okay okay this is getting there I think I could probably break it off and get into it by now you think he's gonna a lot of people say that he takes on the taste or they take on the taste or the flavor of the candy around it so I guess what I'm gonna do here I could probably get well that's gone okay me and I won't I won't man I almost want to do it some more because I don't want the whole point because I didn't want to get in any of the candy that's supposed to be the worst part is the candy Oh God well then you eat it then you got you got enough votes I think that people would probably want to see that oh its tail broke off dang I want to eat this up that wanted to eat this thing hole oh oh we're catching this nasty-ass microwave on camera yeah caught on camera going wrong this definitely needs to be clean this this isn't gonna be that bad I don't think I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna love this thing I think I would like something to drink delicious monster just likes first and they kinda sketch you wanna but I just wanted out this sucker so hot okay well that's its I know she works like a steak all right oh he's he's pretty much out of there he's gonna take on the who he does take on a nutty flavor any flavor he does smell nutty what you actually put it in your mouth you make something good a focused on okay yeah I want to make sure I didn't get all of the he kind of smells like he kind of smells like the nuts that you you get in a yeah I like the nuts you get between your legs they can't smell like those like some sweaty havin balls nah I don't want to say that you did you get you yet you have it focused on it pretty well look at that 4k Ultra HD is nothing let me smell of it smell like [ __ ] that's that mmm cuz I definitely have a nutty whoo all right it's a little bit I'm just not gonna think about it I'm just gonna do it damn this crazy it's very very crunchy stop that bad I hate to say it that tasted the mental part of it's weird if geeks got stuck you too it's not that bad I actually think I'm sexy I feel like I disappointed everybody because I went I should have been more grossed out they thought the mental side of it like putting in your mouth it's the worst part right before you just like oh my god I'm eating a bug but once you eat it it's just like chewy it's an arachnid well rocky what else write in the comments right but what would it smelled like is it smelled a little bit oh my god there's a little exhale I guess I could try going in for seconds here No it kind of tastes like like the sweet nuts you get in it tasted pretty good hey Wade you did contact me did kind of take on the flavor of the banana a little bit but because I wasn't sick of the banana by the time I got to it it didn't you know destroy me we're in an article or somebody ain't and they says like the most phallic speech they've ever had in their life and that's just a scare piece it's not bad it's not bad at all I just tastes like a sweet it's like sweet a little bit sweet nut sweet yeah mm-hmm if we ever need to get another scorpion like I want to try the UH what's other big black ones because they can actually I think they they look pretty good yeah one thumb up all right I'm get up in this blurry [ __ ] real quick thank everybody for joining the Bloorview scorpion blog blog be sure to set this more bugs so AJ can try one for now cuz it says turn I sense the mealworms said no you won't I ain't gonna eat this [

tomorrow with another video", "ZM8WweZn4OE": "hello and welcome to my channel this probably isn't gonna be a long live srimant probably gonna just be a little bit I figured that you uh I live taste test just because I feel like it right whether anybody shows up or says any things completely after them don't matter anyway the blazing went to the store today and got some chips iced teas this is the tube one of them but he also picked up what you saw what some people will see in the thumbnail that I took which is sucker it is called chronic candy it was a dollar ninety-nine it's only ten milligrams high in some shop I don't think it's got THC I think it's just DVD but I really don't know I really can't say but I can show you that the receipt is from Wild Bill the last thing with chronic candy lollipop ten milligram $1.99 hey ghost like I said I don't think it's got THC in it I think it's just CBD but I figured I'd because I've had THC sucker before no biggie yeah we're in the tube top it's hot but I figured I'd do a taste test hearing a little bit I talked a little bit more about the THC one because like I said I've had a THC [ __ ] before I'm gonna point the camera down oh that's fine go don't worry about that 3i point that down a little bit more so that way you tell I'm nearing the top for anybody that pops and mumbling and forward so they don't just see from here on up and think that I'm naked okay I've had to teach this [ __ ] before and that was 150 milligrams that what my ass I don't believe this has THC in it maybe it does um I probably couldn't just call while girls and ask them but what's the point in that when I can just do a taste test for y'all and tell you if I think it hasn't if you've seen it i Cali whacker [Music] the THC one that I've had before with a pink skull you could taste the weed you can taste the granules um you could definitely taste the flavor of weed - it was overpowered by the flavored the selector which I can't remember the flavor of the [ __ ] it mostly cases like weed but it was delicious and like I said it kicked my ass it really did I was looking a half way to do that and I was [ __ ] I'd beyond belief when I say [ __ ] I'd I mean my bean I could see clearly but my eye is really really big so I figured why not do a nice little taste test for YouTube here damn slowly like this does I want to be able to taste it a little bit for this taste test and then put it back in the wrapper I don't eat it all right now so I'm assuming because it's purple hello it kind of looks a little blue so did their blueberry or grape flavored I'm assuming grape holy crap maybe you won't come smaller sucker before I start sucking on it no I can't I can't make it doesn't serve a grape I think it might be blueberry huh how do you know it's blueberry all right another isn't how you think nuts you know I like blueberry I would look at and Wild Bill's website but they don't technically show this kind of stuff on there your website um incense because I've tried looking at while bills for pipes and poles and bongs to see what their prices would be they don't even really give you prices or anything I'm not either so or have a list they just tell you that they have you know certain you know that they sell those things oh it smells good let's give it a taste George document blueberry oh my god it's just like a blueberry - my god whatever is in this is potent I mean I can taste you can taste something but the man's got ouch oh man oh you play with that money Tim I have th Tina doing this like only time Oh Graham I didn't think they'd be so mad about I know it's legal in our state now for recreational use earning Jane felon THC they had only the song CBD at Dollar General there ain't no way they're doing T C there I'm like it I could look and see if they have a chronic Candida calm I guess I will open up a new tab hmm be right back I mean you still see me but I can't see the chair real quick CBD edibles CBD oh you can get gourmet chocolate gelato OG Kush Blue Dream Blue Dream is such a good stream banana OG milk and confuses coverage or cake these monkeys a dream yeah that's EBT seaweedy lollipop you can definitely taste it Wow if you go to the website lollipops I guess they're 10 bucks apiece this was more like too much so if you get orange I guess it's creativity blue ones relaxation purple is euphoria yellow is energetic greenness focus and red is happiness with just strawberry the Green doesn't show a thing on it yellow shows a lemon purple shows blueberries grapes and oranges this one shows a cherry raspberry a blackberry and a blueberry and then creativity is it orange it's actually pretty [ __ ] good CBD nollie I wouldn't mind getting these occasional hi Megan this is really good if they have these in your state I would recommend them I don't know how relaxed I'm gonna get from this but we'll find out like I say I don't think I'm gonna eat the whole thing like right now or anything I'm just gonna stop out for a little while and then put it back that's a little low wrappers yeah opening up the wrapper in the blue my wrapper with um if it's legal in your state and they have them or even go to chronic candy calm and you can like I said you can get going chocolate with CBD in it you can get lollies like this he's in the closet like I said he likes to do much [ __ ] game you rapper demands were down in size a little bit oh yeah goes back in the rapper a lot easier than that came out so yeah I think it's good I like it um I would definitely try out some of the other flavors I would actually try every flavor just to see which one I like the most tasting and also a trial the feeling of more I mean I already know I like relaxation obviously creativity I think that would actually be really cool oh no I don't have relaxation I have euphoria relaxation would be good do I have you for you or do I have maybe I have euphoria maybe have relaxation I don't know energetic would be good to have in the morning have a energetic sucker when you get up or focus but yeah I'm sure I'll sleep fine I didn't sleep that well last night that's very very warm it's still warm today it's terrible right now but I'm gonna do joking my fan for me so I am feeling quite a bit of my fan now where I wasn't before why do you get your butt like that Domino I mean oh no are you doing I knew that you didn't you you're not getting my sucker though you can smell the wrapper you wanna smell the other side where'd the suckers kind of peeking out it there but now you're gonna be hunkered down right there staring at my sucker thinking you gonna get it [ __ ] boy it's funny like all day yesterday I told him I was like I'm not gonna touch nothing and I did I didn't bug him all day yesterday and lo and behold earlier today I was laying here and I wake up for a second to kind of turn over from how I was lean and I noticed in over on Jo side of the bed didn't say nothing tumor anything just looked at him he's seen me look at him then next thing I know I closed my eyes and I feel something on the bed no my eyes back up and look he's away from where he was closer to me and belly up like me my mission I love it huh listen my husband will miss the moment yeah so now you don't want Melvin again oh you're a jerk that's what you I call you a jerk so you start flicking your tail like a little jerk really jerk I don't know not gonna do it now a little bit of a directioner but ya know I like it I do feel a little relaxed I don't think I feel euphoric it's probably a big wall before I feel any of the effects of it I'm gonna sign him take forever I'm taking mostly because it's only ten milligrams that's the reason why it's not gonna be like an extreme experience like it was with the THC one because th Neelix I was a 150 milligrams of THC in that this only has 10 milligrams of CBD mmm maybe had about a quarter of it but I thought this was a fun and interesting taste test I will probably maybe re-edit the title of this and actually say it's a chronic candy sucker or may just leave it as just taste test I don't know yet I know I haven't been on here in a while anything new with anybody No already well I guess I will end this now Oh same ol [ __ ] same ol [ __ ] just different day yeah so that pretty much is everywhere all righty well that was my taste test um I have a two awesome thumbs up I would definitely recommend them especially if you don't want to THC but you do want something to help with like I said the different varieties of like relaxation you know to be focused to be energized like I said energy one would be good in the morning when you first getting on the focus one will be good if you're getting ready to actually go to work or because these don't have th seeing them so you're not gonna be high you're just gonna feel very uh ah hell I can't explain it I'm not a CBD oil expert or anything but or CBD expert but it it's very good the flavors nice of whatever you know um fruit flavors news they were very good man doesn't really turn your xx color like most candy then again I haven't ate the whole thing yet yes I will see you in my next video or stream whatever that is remember take care like if you liked it dislike if you didn't like it share comment subscribe hit the bell if you have it if you want to and I will talk to you all later peace love and harmony one oh I'll get really punished can you just popped in how you doing one you missed my candy taste test it was this see me I know

except for with a different green yeah ready great Oh", "NtGmqEIz9to": "[Music] another review and today I'm doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]",

from dwayne the rock johnson called zoa energy more specifically this is the zero sugar and the wild orange flavor now in case you guys weren't aware i'm actually reviewing every single flavor of zoe energy on this channel so be sure to check out some of the other videos if i'm being honest with you guys some of these flavors haven't been my favorite so far but the wild orange flavor i have pretty high hopes for so let's dive into this thing all right so let's talk about the can real quick before we dive into the taste test overall the zoe energy can is probably not my favorite energy drink can out there it's pretty minimal it does have a little bit of pop of color with the top and the bottom depending on what flavor you're drinking but this isn't really going to grab your attention off the shelf especially if you're a first time buyer in my opinion i think it does look a little bit more like a coffee can like a starbucks or something like that but that's all just opinion so maybe you guys like it let's talk about the can size itself this is actually 16 ounces which in my opinion is the perfect size for an energy drink i don't want like a huge monster and i don't want like a tiny red bull i like to actually sip and enjoy my drink whether it be me working on a video for my main youtube channel or maybe it's me drinking this first thing in the morning before i shoot or before workout i want to actually enjoy what i'm drinking so 16 ounces is perfect now let's talk about what's actually in the can itself um talking about the macros first we have zero fat three carbs and zero protein coming in at 15 calories a couple other things i should note inside of this it has zero artificial flavors zero synthetic colors zero preservatives and then also these are all naturally flavored which is pretty cool this drink has a few more things in it other than just caffeine so let me tell you guys what they are first under immunity it has 100 dv vitamin c as well as vitamin d for focus it has vitamins b6 and b12 for hydration it has potassium and magnesium electrolytes for your body it has 250 milligrams of branched chain amino acids which in my opinion is pretty cool you don't see that in every energy drink out there and then as far as the energy goes it has 160 milligrams of caffeine from green tea extract as well as green coffee beans so honestly the formula is probably my favorite part about these drinks um the 160 milligrams obviously a lot of people look at the caffeine when they're considering an energy drink and i think anywhere around the 200 is the sweet spot i think anything lower than 160 would be way too low and i think anything up in like the 300s is honestly too high in my opinion you want to be able to feel your energy drink but you don't want to be like shaking from it either so somewhere in that middle ground of the 200 range um is great in my opinion so i don't really mind the 160. if it's gonna be on one side i'd rather be on the lower side all right now let's dive into what you guys are actually probably here for which is the actual taste test itself so let me go ahead and crack this thing open man that sound never gets old okay so we gotta give it a little smell test here see what we're working with oh that smells really good honestly that's probably the best smelling one that i've had so far yeah it smells just like orange juice honestly naturally flavored so it smells great all right i got high hopes for this one i i hope this is the one for me that i love the zoe energy okay so we're gonna try it out okay okay so it's definitely my favorite that i've had so far so one thing i'll say about all the zoe energy drinks being naturally flavored some flavors are definitely sweeter and taste a little bit better in my opinion than other ones this one is really true to orange it's definitely not like a sun-kissed orange this is more like i guess like an orange juice flavored if that makes sense so it's not crazy sweet it definitely tastes natural like real oranges not like just sugar but yeah this one is actually really good and i actually have this thing ice cold and it tastes really good i definitely would drink this one again all right so i'm gonna have to give this one a rating i've been a little harsh on some of the other zoa flavors to be honest but this one surprised me so i'm gonna have to give this a rating of an 8.6 out of 10. like i said this is definitely one of my favorite zoa's that i've had so far but it still isn't exactly the vibe i want from an energy drink a lot of times i use an energy drink with like a lunch or something or like in the afternoon as a pick-me-up and i usually want something like really sweet this one it's just a little too natural flavoring for me which i guess sounds ridiculous i want artificial flavoring i don't know i just don't want to be drinking orange juice in the afternoon but i guess maybe if i had to shoot really early in the morning and i wanted something like that this would be a great option for me but maybe i'm being a little too harsh because overall this does taste pretty good but my ultimate test i always talk about in all my reviews is if you were on a road trip and you ran into a gas station real quick to grab a drink would you pick this one out two things i consider with that one does it jump off the shelf at you does it make you want to pick it up um i think the orange of the black is probably the best and the most appealing out of any of the cans so far but in my opinion it still kind of looks like a coffee can more than an energy drink it's not like throwing up unicorns like some drinks out there look like with their branding but it is pretty clean so for me i probably wouldn't reach for it first and as far as the flavor goes this one is good but i kind of think of a gas station thing as like a treat um and this doesn't really seem like something that i reach for first at least but if someone gave this to me i wouldn't be upset by it by any means it's really good flavor um and probably my favorite so far of the zoa's so yeah guys overall it's a pretty good drink it just personally maybe isn't my favorite one that i've had out there before but i think a lot of you guys would actually enjoy this flavor but guys that's gonna be it for my review of zoe energy um actually a really cool thing about them is they're actually now shipping on amazon so i have a link to them down in my description below if you guys want to pick any of these up yourself and check them out i think this one would be the one to choose if you guys are looking for one if you did enjoy today's video will you please drop it a thumbs up and also subscribe those things really help the channel out and if you guys want to see any more content from me in the meantime i will also have a link to my main youtube channel down in the description below if you guys want to show any support over there as well let me know in the comments below what other drinks or supplements you guys want to see me review in the future nothing is off the table so i'd love to hear you guys feedback that's gonna be it for me and i am actually

to my channel so today he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty

really about it because I made it up myself and the reason I made it up myself was when I was 21 I ate my way through South America I went there and I weighed one hundred and two pounds and I came back weighing hundred and forty eight pounds now it's lucky because I gained it everywhere but and it was the first time in my life I had boobs who I kind of liked it except when the guy started talking to me and they wouldn't talk to my face they would talk to my boobs kind of different anyway this is such a good candy I'm gonna show you how to make it it's really interesting and what you need are two eggs some almonds strawberries Truvia or stevia whatever you like and I use a little coconut oil to put it in a pan so that the eggs don't stick to it okay we're gonna get started so I just smooshed the coconut oil around so that it's evenly distributed on the bottom of the pan one more for good measure and I pour in and using coconut oil gives it a really yummy taste a better taste and if you just use vegetable oil then you cover your eggs and it just let it sit there for a couple seconds so you have to keep checking on your eggs to make sure that they're not gonna burn because I burn a lot of stuff okay and I see they're starting starting to really get kind of fluffy and by Bolivian so you just keep it covered um if you cover eggs when they're boiling when they're whatever they're doing under the flame they get thicker so that's what you want a nice little base okay now I think we're ready yes look good so now you take your nuts the almonds and you sprinkle them all around then you take your spatula and whip it right on there and I know it looks like a really good omelet - and you just let it stick on low for a couple seconds now I've taken a paper plate and a sheet of wax paper maybe omelet on there cover it you let it cool for a little while and then you put it in the freezer hi it's the next day and I just came home from the gym and I'm ready to take that candy out of the freezer so here's what we do I take this little box and I take this and I slice it into little pieces just like it's candy so what I did was I took this little box and I put wax paper on the bottom and I have ten pieces in there and then I cover it with another piece of wax paper and I'm gonna put ten more pieces on top now you've got your box of candy with twenty pieces of candy in there now if you get a regular box of candy two pieces is a hundred and sixty two 180 calories and that's just two pieces of candy and you ten times that and you've got 1,600 calories and you twenty times it and you've got 2,600 calories 2,600 calories for a box of candy and this box of candy with twenty pieces is only 333 calories so you can eat the whole box but don't do that you don't want to do that because you want to actually teach yourself to curb your appetite and you can do it with this you can do it's sweet it's delicious and um 17 calories a bite enjoy I'll see you next time", "j79R3cDNUsg": "today we are showing you how to make these candy um suckers Adam driving or you don't have to you can use sucker sticks or anything to hold it on or if you don't want two and make this okay okay so what we will need is water and jolly ranchers so it has to be hot water very hard or boiling water and something to hold it on or nothing to hold on yeah we're doing hold on so whenever it's like if it feels like if you like warm actually if you weren't like a good texture flexible texture then leave it in for a long time but if you don't want it that good of a flexible texture and then you don't want to put it put it in there too long either cuz it'll get all sticky and it'll get all stringy and you don't want that you want it to stay and as you see what i'm doing i am dipping it in the water taking it out of the wrap and molding it on to my handle on domestic and i only have to jolly ranchers I have a whole bag of Jolly wrenches right behind me but I'm not this is a small bowl see a nice flexible texture and try to get it as far as you can and then just slap it on there and I was going for a rose text see I'm trying to go it's kind of like a rose oh and if your water still hot you can always just for you use it so I'm going to get some more daughters you actually want to roll this around so I doesn't get stick and then you want to put it in your thing you're going to let these sit for about like 15 or 20 minutes okay and also what I forgot to mention that other people have done this the only one person I know that had done it was Miranda sings a sister I watched her tutorial and from this one out her tutorial is rose ones though so yeah but this oh that's our microwave that's the water we were being very and now our jolly ranchers have melted look at that and this is actually a good activity for actually like like party stuff treats Halloween candy you anything we will be back with the next back to draw the Richer we just used the one that we already did and we put two more jolly richer stuff I'll be back when they're hot and you probably want to check here like every five minutes or sell because they really they really I'm sorry um together to promote fast or a few minutes and if it actually opens up its wrapper then you need to take that up re fast so um we're going to let this sit for about ten to five minutes and we'll be right back okay as you can see there dunno they're very flexible slob we'll get them out of the water and then i will show you okay you guys this is our final result it we were kind of going for a rose but i don't know if it looks like a rose but it looks good i actually have to give myself credit on it looked very good and it tastes varied the lunches um the flavors for this one are the green to green apple cherry and watermelon this one was sour cherry and green apple that's the bedroom and yes i washed my hands and this kind of gross but this one is watermelon and green apple very de lunches and i have i'm about to add some stuff see i got a whole bag of each other in turn adding gum this is actually what I'm along gun how do you say watermelon watermelon and some more jolly ranchers this is a very good like hop I do it for like a halloween-themed thing and this is actually really good and it is like a good candy bowl so now guys that's it hope you create it right see you

show you how to make these yummy fruit lollipops that i have right over here they are so good and so delicious they might look like real lollipops but much healthier okay this is the ingredients you're going to need you will need a watermelon some delicious delicious grapes you want you can use raspberries blackberries or blueberries if you have them and any shape cutter i'm using a heart over here and you will need some skewers and remember you have to ask a parent to help because it's really dangerous if you're a little kid using the skewers so always ask a parent to help with the skewers part the first step you're going to do is you're going to get the heart cutter and cut out the watermelon with the heart cutter to make a heart thing you remember you could use any heart cutter or any cutter you have and if you don't have any of the cookie cutters you could also use play-doh cutters after cutting down and you're happy with the shape get the grapes and the skewers get this one skewer and put the grape on top and remember the grown-up has to help put everyone on top until it's fully stacked then you will put the heart watermelon on top of your skewer and then there is your heart lollipop all completed you", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this one i like the sour ones and i'll see you in the next one", "ki2etqoeS1s": "and what is up guys it's your boy just me I'm here my teaching today I'm going to be making DIY cool a lollipop let's get it
