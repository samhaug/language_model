{"yTANu5Hcl1A": "hey everybody welcome back as you can see just some natural lighting today and that is because I feel like I'm often talking about my cycle but it is because I have endometriosis so the pain excuse me for my voice but the pain can be just really bad so I didn't even feel like setting up my lighting today so I just set it up like this so welcome back but I am currently in a lot of pain so I'm gonna talk a little bit about edibles the first thing you should know is that if you've never done adipose before you need to find something that's very low dose okay your liver transforms TCA into 11 hydroxy THC which is a much more potent format of THC and it is very intoxicating so that's why oftentimes people will have like really bad trips on edibles because they think that they're taking like these small doses that dosages they think like Oh 10 milligrams whatever and then it hits like 30 so you have to be very careful if you've never done edibles before if your tolerance for edibles is really low outside of that apples are incredible for pain and that's why I'm choosing to go with them today because like I said I'm in a lot of pain and I like to be really honest with you guys so that's what I'm working with today I have some babies Eddie these are medicated shoes there are five choose each one of one flavor and each Jew has 20 milligrams of THC I'm not going to lie that's pretty strong even for me like I don't have a very high tolerance for edibles but I chose Betty studies because as you saw on the package it's vegan it's gluten-free it's dairy feet free and it's made with real fruits and veggies so like I thought that that was pretty cool that they were still taking in so many people's like dietary restrictions I do like that it's childproof I think that's important to do you have children in the home I know of course you want your stash to be somewhere secluded but it's also nice to know that it has that childproof lock on it as well so looks like I did get one of each flavor okay oh my god this smells so good I believe that this is the flavor very good thing very good things that's right cute so the papers kind of stick into it you know that's okay had a lot of practice with now and laters so it don't bother you too much I think that they need to get better paper because it's sort of like stuff to it you know I think that they could do a little bit of treatment to the paper or more treatment to the paper get just like a higher quality wax paper that is really delicious oh my god okay y'all need to sell that in popsicle form that one's really good it's a little hard to chew it definitely does have a tacky texture to it it's kind of getting stuck to my teeth for me that's a little inconvenient it's just only a little bit it's not yeah I'll only dog like half a point lemon tastes like any other lemon candy you know sourness and her bitterness which doesn't really bother me that much it is not as good as the berry very good team River so this one's called my little lemon heaven that's cute what's next next up is orange beautiful aren't you beautiful maybe a little bit a little bit the orange one does not mask the taste of the teach the at all I definitely taste cannabis it's not nasty it just has that like earthiness that you don't really expect when when you have a really well-made edible so the last one that I'll be testing is lime a good person I'm a good person are you that's disgusting okay it's this good it is disgusting and it's really sour I don't know II love lime flavor like I like limes ooh that's nasty who does next I'm not gonna spit it out because I need my medication but oh that's nasty it tastes like expired spray was consumed by a STONER pissed out and then repackaged as some new health to drink I don't like it at all it's nasty would s gross I thought the women was gonna be the worst flavor the line is hate it hate it so what I'm gonna do is take about just half more of the very good things because it was very very delicious I really really liked the flavor on this one like I said only thing that I don't really care for is the texture I do think that yes it's taffy I think it's supposed to be a little bit more fun cute recreational but it's really hard to get off the roof or your mother or your teeth Cheers oh right now my pain level is right now my pain level is actually not that bad it's maybe had a 5 out of 10 a 5 out of 10 so it's manageable earlier it was much higher like around 7 or 8 and that's why I decided let me just go ahead and try and get dress into this video but right now it's kind of cool down I think because I was moving around I keeping my mind off of it I think this will be really really helpful so yeah I'm gonna watch some Doctor Who and report that then maybe like our so that [ __ ] hey if they're dead late I still feel my cramps but there may be like like a 2 or a 3 they're still manageable the high for me it's a little bit more heady it's also like kind of sitting in my chest I noticed like the first sign that it was starting to hit with that my heartbeat started going a little bit faster for whatever reason it's odd it didn't cause anxiety or anything but that's just the first effect that I noticed and oh and then after that I just started to feel like scattered I went from not wanting to do anything today at all to feeling like ok I can manage the pain I might do a little bit of yoga so I mean I think that's dope like I could see a change already especially also a change in mood it's not necessarily that I feel productive it's just that I am in a place where it's like oh I can finally kind of take care of myself because yoga does help it wasn't heavy yoga or anything nothing fast or sweaty just kind of moving my body in a way that felt natural and in a way it I guess it was intuitive type of movement so so far I'm really appreciating it like I said I think my pain level is more like at a 3 now I think it's only about like 3540 minutes later my metabolism is really fast so edibles to hit me pretty fast I am gonna eat some food real quick as well I have the munchies so bad like edibles always do that to me like I get crazy munchies with edibles so I have the munchies really really bad so I'm gonna eat some food and watch more TV and if there's an update I'll check in later I'll see you guys soon continues to lesson because I can't function I'm trying I'm Jack I'm here present okay so I just forced myself to get up so I could check in with y'all I'm very smacked I'm very much enjoying it probably still gonna do with some more because it does feel really really good I don't want to go over the edge I am still gonna wait a little bit longer it's been about 20 minutes since my last check-in so I think that's almost an hour and almost up there it feels really good I feel like I'm gonna take a nap and I really I need to eat and I'm probably gonna go to sleep but I'm gonna say that my final score for Betty's daddy's is gonna be um I think a 4 out of 5 4 out of 5 and I am really happy with the end result again and result being I'm pain-free which was the main reason why I was using today you know so anyways thanks guys for tuning in I appreciate you supporting me if you want to support support oh if you would like to support me further you can follow me on instagram

This\nmorning we're taking a look at a grape but it's not just any grape it's\nRazzMatazz grape now what RazzMatazz does is combines\nthe texture of a typical table grape so think\nthin skin, seedlessness, that kind of crisp crunch\nthat like a red table grape from the grocery store would have\nwith the incredible flavor and heartiness of a native muscadine\nso if you like me are from the north and have not had the chance to try\nmuscadines you're really missing out it's such an incredibly intense little\nburst of flavor they're sweet they're floral they kind\nof have that ah foxy for a lack of better term but\nthat interesting complexity that muscadines tend to have\nand really this great popping crisp texture now RazzMatazz\nis best enjoyed when it reaches this really dark red color it's tempting to\nstart to pick them as soon as they begin to color up\nbut for best flavor definitely wait until it gets to be this dark\nrich maroon color the grapes themselves are quite a bit smaller than a typical\ngrape but i have found that the kids really tend to favor these grapes\nbecause they're like the perfect bite-sized snack\nand they make a really nice addition to like an hors d'oeuvre tray\nor just even as an edible garnish to a plate and it's fun to see how surprised\nfolks are sometimes at how such a tiny little bite\ncan still contain such a huge burst of flavor now another incredible attribute\nto RazzMatazz is this continually fruiting habit\nthis is the world's first ever continually fruiting grape\nand what that means is that this grape continues to set fruit\nall the way down the fruiting branches as long as the season continues\nso this thing will continue to set and ripen fruit\nall the way up until our frost which is about mid-october\nif you live in further south zones it will just keep going and going\nnow as i mentioned these rasmus has grapes have that really\nhealthy hearty parentage of the native muscadines\nso these tend to be really disease resistant and somewhat pest resistant\nnow you can see i have a little bit of japanese beetle\ndamage on the leaves really it was much much less than the\ngrapes that i typically grow here they also don't succumb to many of the\nmildews and other fungal diseases that grapes\nare often prone to now you can see RazzMatazz behind me here\ni've got it growing in hanging baskets because RazzMatazz is actually hardy in\nzones seven through nine i'm in 6a but i've had really great\nsuccess growing these in hanging baskets they do\nreally well in a big container on the patio as well\nbut if you're growing in zones north of seven you'll want to make sure to grow\nit in a container so that you can bring it in for some winter protection\nthrough the cold months so let me know if you have grown RazzMatazz\ni'd love to hear other folks experience and be sure to stop back for another\nfriday morning favorites thanks for watching and i'll see you\nnext time", "iyiOVUbsPcM":

our logo cookies baking buddies i started it in california i love to bake growing up and i just i would bring cookies to work and i thought hey what a great idea i should start a business doing cookies even though i've never worked in food before so i started doing wholesale and stuff like that and i started out with one cookie flavor now we have 26 different flavors and i moved back to minnesota a year ago and opened at the mall of america where we are today so we were getting a ton of requests to do custom logo cookies custom images on cookies prior to using the eddie we used these edible frosting sheets where you had to print individually and you had to peel them off one by one i was trying to you know research different products and try different products to you know find the the best solution for us with the eddie it just is a better quality product it saves us a ton of time because you're actually printing right to the cookie the turnaround time to package is just it's huge for us it definitely helps that it's nsf certified because we're supposed to only use nsf certified products with food it's very important that it's a stainless steel a food grade printer just it's very easy to use so you can just pop the cookies right onto the eddy take them off it's easy to clean it's just a very seamless process it just prints i mean it looks like literally it just printed off of a printer you would never be able to tell that this is you know printed on an edible you know with edible ink on a cookie like it just the quality of it is just so amazing recently we did a project for 800 of the logo cookies and we used eddie for the first time with that large of a project and it went super smooth such an amazing process every single cookie all 800 looked exactly the same the images were crisp and perfect the eddie has been amazing for us with these large orders i feel like anybody could learn how to use the eddie printer in a matter of like a day so it was very very easy seamless process i think the biggest thing was just adjusting like the cookie size and making sure you have the icing right and once you got that down i think it's pretty quick and easy so it just creates an all-around better product for the customer and saves us a lot of time", "g0gEYgeIVbE": "[Music] what's up youtube what's right dumb dumb coming back at you again what's up my

today so check it out okay guys for this product review video I'm going to be trying some edibles and I know this is crazy because we don't really review edibles much on this channel now really quick before we get into this let me kind of explain why I don't really do a whole lot of edibles and it's not because I don't like edibles I love edibles okay the reason that you guys don't see a whole lot of edibles on this channel is mainly for the fact that here in the state of Oregon edibles is limited to 50 milligrams for recreational so anybody 21 and up you are limited here in the state of Oregon to only 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy multiple but that can get rather expensive okay that can get rather expensive especially when some of these edibles are like 15 20 25 bucks okay so 50 milligrams that's weak sauce I agree with you I know what anybody's gonna say in the comments section on this video they're gonna be like 50 milligrams that's [ __ ] that's weak sauce blah blah blah blah blah blah don't take it out on me please that is just what the state limits us and I can't really help that okay medical gets a hundred milligrams so if you're a medical marijuana patient you got your medical card you can get access to a hundred milligrams but that's still not much better okay because a few years ago before 2015 you could get like thousand milligram if not more you know like I had a 16 a hundred milligram edible lollipop once and it was phenomenal okay so before that before the legalization happened we used to be able to get all different kinds of stuff and they were very well priced so without further ado let's get into this edible review alright so for this review I have here this awesome rice krispie treats all right they are bite-size as you guys can see I rice krispie treats now I'm multiple because they're 50 milligrams each I have three here they were about six dollars for wreck or a recreational a little bit cheaper for medical of course so I bought three of them that's about a hundred and fifty milligrams total I still know that that's not a whole lot okay I know there's tons of us out there that'd be like like $500,000 but but I mean like he's not bad right not bad I could have just got one and been like hey guys here's my 50 milligrams it's gonna be great all right no but I got all three so I can at least feel something another reason why you don't see me do a lot of edible refuses because 50 milligrams 100 milligrams for me stuff like that it's not I'm not gonna feel it okay I have a high extremely high tolerance okay so I need those like four or five six hundred milligram edibles in order to really really feel it that's um I believe there was a person who wants to comment in my last edible video I did a long time ago and they said something like oh he got so high he forgot to come back and tell us how it was which is not true because the truth is is I kind of felt it a tiny bit a little bit so you know what I mean like for somebody who has a low tolerance for somebody who doesn't smoke a lot or doesn't take a lot of edibles stuff like that 50 milligrams is gonna is going to be right where you need okay 50 milligrams is gonna do the job if you're like a beginner or if you're somebody who has extremely low tolerance 50 milligrams is all you need but for us like me who dab all day long and smoke and all that kind of [ __ ] I have a high tolerance I have to at least get three of these even to feel like the slightest bit of a buzz okay so here we go we're gonna go ahead and get into these now these are the can of Krispies cannabis treats bite size 50 milligrams they take it says it takes about 60 minutes for activation that kind of ranges depending on the person depending on your body size stuff like that that could range that could be 30 minutes all the way up to an hour and a half of edibles to kick in anywhere in between there right I love that these are bite-size because I'm not one of those people that like to eat a whole [ __ ] [ __ ] ton of sweets just to get especially a small little milligram as 50 milligrams okay so I like that their bike size I really do if they would have not been bite size if it would have been like a big-ass chunk for only 50 milligrams I would have complained I would already instantly be downing this this review but the fact that their bite size is even better oh you can chase the canvas not much it's not like a strong taste but you can faintly taste it you can faintly taste it mmm all right let's get the rest these [Music] [Music] oh all right so I've eaten all three all right it's gonna take a little bit to kind of feel them if if I feel it because again it's only 150 milligrams which I should feel something right like you should feel something even if you do have a high tolerance should feel a little bit of something you know what I mean yeah that's just my opinion in my thoughts these were good they tasted great they're Bitesize I love it the fact that they're only six dollars to me they could be a little less than that that's the only kind of complaint that I have here with this product is the fact that six dollars for bite size little edible fifty milligrams it's alright it's alright it's a little push in it but it's alright it's still affordable okay Joe only because I remember back in the day you used to be able to get fifty milligrams for five dollars or less okay you know you know 100 milligrams ten bucks or less you know and so on so forth you know but not bad a taste great tastes like a good rice krispies it's got a little bit of an aftertaste to it you could definitely kind of taste the lead on the aftertaste like right now I can still kind of taste it a little bit like I could tell that it wasn't all just rice krispies hi if I was somebody who never had cannabis before I'd be like did you use something different in this recipe kind of tastes a little odd you know little little tinge maybe yeah you know that would be my reaction to because like I said the aftertaste you can taste a little bit however it's not a super strong pungent weed taste it's not one of those edibles that you'll eat and go oh you know what I mean it faintly tasted it's very mild okay overall it's a good edible it's definitely something I'll give a thumbs up for I will if it affects me if if I can feel a good high off of it if I can feel any kind of a high off of it really I will come back and do kind of like a follow-up for this if not then just know that I pretty much just did this review for the taste and you know the overall just checking it out you know what I mean it's not so much of the high alright because I like I said like I explained early in the video I need a little bit more than that for me personally and again this is just for me personally okay others it might not need that much and then other people might need a lot more so it depends on you depends on your tolerance and it depends on you know where you're at with your cannabis usage all right so much love guys I hope this video is somewhat entertaining and informational if you guys like this channel if you guys like this video if you like me hey remember to give it a big thumbs up smash that like button support this channel and please guys please please please consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb the one and only and much love guys I hope you guys all have a very blessed very positive day or night wherever you're viewing this video from and until next time alright so it's been about an hour and 45 minutes and I'm feeling a little Spacey feeling it very mildly it's kind of a little relaxing it's a little creeping up if you will but I thought hey hey what's up the stakes a little bit all right shall we shall we up the milligrams now really quick let me just apologize for this being kind of an extra long video I'm sorry about that I will try my best to fast-forward through the parts of me eating so we'll kind of shorten the length now but anyway I got three more here now these are the cocoa ones okay so they have the regular ones these are the cocoa ones Cocoa Krispies and I got another three so it's another 150 for a grand total of 300 milligrams which some people might be like I am that's nothing that's that's weak sauce ba ba ba ba ba which yeah you know it is but whatever what we're gonna do it hmm so alright first one up here we go now again the same company this is the same company these are just the cocoa ones 50 milligrams each bite-sized edibles all right and you got to make sure that you get like all of them I'm sure all the little chunks and pieces don't let anything little pieces go [Music] you [Music] all right so there it is 300 milligrams I'm gonna come back in another hour hour and a half or so and I'll let you guys know how the effects are which should be a lot greater shouldn't be like super high it's not gonna be like uh like a Drunken level of high you know where I must like oh I'm so uh you know it's not gonna be like that however it should be you know I should be able to feel it pretty good should get a good you know nice feel from it so we will be back with you guys here at about an hour yeah about an hour hour and a half and we will see how this works all right so it's been about another hour and a half and feeling all right feeling all right a little a little more Spacey a lot more relaxed to feel nice and relaxed I could definitely fall asleep right now I could tell you that right now edibles are great for that in my opinion if you ever need something to help you fall asleep just load up on some edibles don't don't take too much okay don't take too much know your limits okay know what works best for you but I do love edibles I do love hi milligram edibles I should say and they're all all right there all right it sucks see if it takes so many just to get you know the milligrams that I took or more like that's crazy that you have to eat so much like if you're somebody who's just taking edibles you're not even smoking you're not even dabbing you're not even doing any of that other stuff and you're just taking edibles like this you're probably gonna be diabetic after the first like eight to 12 months okay I'm just saying just saying with how many you have to buy to get the correct milligrams that you need that's crazy okay anyway I hope you guys found this video entertaining much love please smash that like button show that support and hey if you'd like to see more content just like this thing consider

some Parmesan cheese some salad with some French salad dressing wash that down with a cold Molson Canadian and that's supper oh my flock off to wash my meat cigarette I'm gonna try one of these [ __ ] thingamabobs that came out of the grass chief order so it'll be broken up because I dropped it on the basement floor okay and you severe hurt you know then it's okay would there's a billion better things for the munchies in this [ __ ] smoking weed and the end of all like dry you know this isn't gonna [ __ ] help anything it's only gonna make matters worse came with two in the pack I'll save the other one for Dona she went to take Charlie for a walk I'm pretty sure she said she was going to what you call it drink one of those hot chocolates the 50 milligrams 50 milligrams of THC usually she only does I think 25 milligrams per night like over edibles at so 50 milligrams let's double what she's used to we'll see what happens Canada Post is working again they're finally [ __ ] moving so I decided today to order up that external piece for the GoPro and [ __ ] Donna found some little microphone on line for me there looks like it'll go nice so order that up too but Canada Post is pretty backed up I bet so I don't know how long it's going to take to get here so yeah yeah okay the water is boiled dollars gonna pour it into the cup which doesn't fly all over the floor do you want any milk or anything okay we'll let that cool down a little bit and then we'll come back to us tastes the weed you mean the THC you teach you can taste the THC in there in just a little bit don't know what else right now but yeah it's good well we'll come back in a little while when the when the effects start to uh why well there's a first time for everything isn't it hey we'll we'll come back when the wind starts to kick in [ __ ] you have for that house it asked you how you feel but I already know I think everybody watching those could you were laughing already I wonder what the [ __ ] you're laughing at that's how long you're laughing you were looking over here laughing and I was one yeah the whole time we'll even look at the tape later we're not the tape the video you know people just want to know how you feel after taking that I think they can tell it you're happy if somebody who's having aches and pains and it took that if you having a good maybe having a good old time what you can hurt yourself more sure if your wrist was broken and it wasn't a lot of pain and then you have like a lot and the people away so you start like using your wrist for that's probably not a good thing if you have a broken wrist and you just start using it I think if you had a sore wrist you would know that your wrist had problems [ __ ] you just [ __ ] insect [ __ ] you or something [ __ ] right in view there you wouldn't feel the pain because if it landed on you slapping it off and running it wouldn't get a chance to bite yeah I know how you are edibles make you want to sit and not move around too much the tuna ate I think the guys that smoked it either be going anywhere I think everybody get pretty lazy yeah sit by the [ __ ] tree what tree you're [ __ ] we'll be right back so

like subscribe and [ __ ] off eh you", "L4_VhpkGwdc": "hey everybody this is my buddy Riley and earlier this week Riley gone to the trash because Riley is a trash digger and he ate a whole bag of great and I'm not sure if many of you know the grapes are toxic and to pets dogs and it doesn't matter if a one or a whole bag which is what Riley did they are toxic and my significant other didn't know how to respond to that other than rushing him to the vet which is great great response to that but I teach pet CPR and First Aid and there's another thing that you can do in case you can get to the vet right away luckily for us and for Riley we had a vet that was right down the street and we're able to get in there to respond in a timely fashion so number one grapes these healthy treats that we eat are toxic to pets and I teach that in my pet CPR first aid classes but I also teach that hydrogen peroxide which is how the vet responded to Riley when he got there acts as a regurgitation it induces vomiting for the animal so if you have a syringe you can syringe the hydrogen peroxide in or you can just pour it down their throat and it will induce vomiting and they will throw up anything that's in their stomach which helps to get that stuff out of there and then you monitor them for 24 hours or once you get the food out you can get them to the vet safely and then the vet can monitor them from that point so that is something that you will learn in my pet CPR in first aid classes and I highly recommend that anybody that owns a pet brings your animal or not brings your animal but learns pet CPR and First Aid just like we learn it for humans because it can really save a life and really help you to help your pet get to the vet so that they can then respond to your animals so June 10th and July 22nd look on my Facebook page epic animals outreach for those dates and how to sign up and remember be kind because all life matters so be kind to yourself the kind of your neighbor and be kind to all animals I hope you have a great weekend", "bZfCq3H6tLQ": "hey everybody this is paul and today we're going to check out sweet sapphire grapes now these are black seedless grapes that were actually grown in chile and shipped here to southern california and it's march so they are definitely ripe and you can see they're a very unusual shape which is what makes them so unique they're kind of similar to moon drops you've seen us hopefully taste those before man it's a good grape but you can see that they definitely have like a log shape i guess you could say they're very long and have a unique end i really like them they brixted a 19 as you can see here which is a nice respectable score especially for being shipped from south america and i really like them they do say that black grapes have a bit more antioxidants and nutrients you know if you look online that's what people say i just really like the flavor and the texture something about them i like a bit more than the other colored grapes and you can see they're definitely seedless which is great so there's not little seeds as sometimes you get with certain varieties that are advertised as seedless let's try cutting it this way get a nice view of it and these were created by ifg or international fruit genetics and they don't use gmos it's non-gmo they're kind of like master breeders and they describe this as a grape that colors well as you can see i would agree to that and there you um they store well they have that unusual shape like we talked about they describe it as elongated and tubular on their website and they have this dimpled end which is a unique characteristic now these grapes were eaten have been grown and eaten in the middle east for a while but they're relatively new here in the usa and again they have a nice crisp pleasant flavor that's how i would describe them hope to get some that are a little bit more fresh this season in southern california i'm sure i can find them at local stores so i'm going to keep my eye out i think in may or june i hope is when they are ripe i believe i saw that online so there you go the sweet sapphire grapes give us a like and a subscribe thanks so much so much for your time have a great day [Music] you", "UFZyDK4w884": "yeah I think the guy who drew the artwork for these games used to work for Walt Disney so not surprised Reagan's lair play as the heroic Dirk the daring the valiant knight on a rescue to the fairway from the clutches of evil great Prince's name is Daphne and we learned how to pronounce that name last night [Music] all right [Music] yeah we need a substance Eddington Oh close like a drawing time oh yo fresh we'll watch the intro this this is the art original arcade intro when the cabinet was idle Dragon's Lair look bad as the adventure will you become a valiant light on a quest to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon you control the actions of a daring adventurer finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard I love the staticky noise on the screen to make VHS 83 baby so the thing about drink is lair is you guys have to understand when you walk into an arcade and you're surrounded by games like Tetris Galaga [ __ ] pac-man space invaders okay a guerra like that and then all of a sudden you see this machine that literally has a [ __ ] cartoon plane and you control the character it was mind-blowing it was like how could they possibly do this in that time in 1983 this machine was like this game was like so ahead of its time you just didn't comprehend in right it was kind of like the equivalent of when when what's it called Donkey Kong [Music] but Donkey Kong Country first came though for the Super Nintendo yeah I see what you're saying calls and you know they had all this pre-rendered [ __ ] so it was really clever what they did with this of course it's all cutscenes that's how I worked around it but back in the arcade days like this machine was [ __ ] expensive for me I think around the time where everything was like 25 to 50 cents this machine was like a dollar so when I was a kid I did not have the ball to play this game and it looked [ __ ] hard I saw all the adults play it I didn't know what the hell they were doing because I'm just watching it and like mesmerized and not understanding like what the controls because there's nothing on the screen that tells you what to do and they're just controlling the cutscenes so I thought it was like mind boggling and I didn't understand how like different capture scenes worked like that back then so it was it was [ __ ] madness bro so yeah like this these games laserdisc games or art are really really sick ok see if I can fix the video sighs my cat will just fullscreen it it's not a big deal you the research I think Enzo put it too put it - what's a coal hey we'll just fullscreen this [ __ ] we'll just fullscreen like re3 Louise the re3 over there No you it should have a good change all right let's play ok so I was looking at some of the settings and I don't really know which settings we should use definitely should max out the last [ __ ] here's the way to get infinite logic to do that move beeps we'll keep on moved I definitely have on then the original arcade version it showed you nothing on the [ __ ] screen the controls are literally up-down left-right and attack and it's just I guess I'd cancer our cake at with the phone off so the arcade version play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet easy [Music] the homers is the original laser this version of the game third must pass through each scene before I think we should do the home version just so we see all the cutscenes and difficulty easy we'll have more time to react for certain scenes some difficult moves have been removed [Music] we should pipe it on hard and see how that goes oh we should play on the hardest setting first alright alright let's do this you if it's too hard then [ __ ] it we'll play on easy [Music] in the arcade version I haven't even have that scene for something oh I think I [ __ ] I see how spoons press right twice dude in the arcade version it wouldn't tell you anything you just have to know you lose your [ __ ] dollar right there like this game is hard as balls if we match this can I go show you guys there is an arcade version man I'll show you all [ __ ] stupidest to at least a shoal something there but still I think you guys going to see the screen a lot by the way man you're gonna be fast dude who's like Oh [Music] [Music] but his screams are so funny dude no [Music] [Music] I [ __ ] press right oh no Rapids okay how am I supposed to kill the press up here how the [ __ ] would you figure that out oh god okay this is obvious dude you be screaming too if you're in this [ __ ] situation [Applause] okay good let's let's continue thank god this is just scary bro what this whole castle is a Disney [Music] revitalize Daphne that's sound effect [Music] once again I'll have to remind you guys that the original arcade version had no prompts on the [ __ ] screen you literally just had to figure it out and you would go broke trying to beat this [ __ ] English is he stabbed in the back bro you this game is designed to eat your money exactly it was oh [ __ ] holy [ __ ] down [Music] [Music] [Music] and there you can choose different hats too in this game which is really sick but we're playing so we see all the customs Oh God holy [ __ ] oh my god okay that seemed looked impossible like without the prompts you would be dead there's no way do don't get my ass kicked that I do have prompts like I said after this I want to show you guys the original arcade version I want to show you guys how impossible [Music] Oh God oh my god I like ice cream damn it I think that chad has counted how many how many ladies have spent on the game how many times have I [ __ ] up guys 14 dude that's not even enough for a for a [ __ ] apex gun skin I can't even buy anything apex legends with that apex gun skin is $20 oh [ __ ] like sometimes the game has mercy on you and shows you at him man up for days [ __ ] [Music] this sounds e makes or so I thought we just did this [ __ ] oh it's another way to try to trick me dude reusing accents what'd you say oh [ __ ] what'd you say no [Music] Jesus bounce if you actually saw come on [ __ ] I didn't let three times bro if you're in the medieval times and you went down the elevator that's looking faster you [ __ ] your pants oh [ __ ] I remember this [ __ ] I remember people swearing at the arcade arcade cab during this [ __ ] cutscene this is notorious this is cancer [Music] - it was cancer this dude is on my ass slice them holy Kate how are you supposed to figure this out in the arcade I just wanted him five times you're telling me someone figured that out on their own what I didn't see a prompt hold the [ __ ] weapon rack what the [ __ ] fifty dollars deep at this point bro I'd be [ __ ] broke-ass by here and dude I'm talking about one with the swing six times that's GG there's no way to get past that scene oh my god [Music] no not the [ __ ] marbles again slice it Oh God reuse assets Oh hopefully doesn't trick me drink me okay so it requires you to memorize certain scenes and if you have it in the reverse you gotta remember the opposite directions that's crazy Google is over [Music] what whoops dude the time it is so fast [Music] okay oh no not this [ __ ] again [Music] [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] this is fine this is the status tree Firefly right now this is fine [Music] [Music] [Music] what what this was supposed to do there [Music] okay that shake hand fall oh [ __ ] what there's a different time guys it was a different time a better time [ __ ] don't weigh all the way back here [ __ ] impossible [Music] [ __ ] it's hard to see the damn arrows because the [ __ ] goal is the same color [Music] [Music] save me the cage is locked was the key the dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon use the magic sword run run nice no come on I pressed it so [ __ ] fast okay it's three swings in a row it's three swings in a row god damn it you guys are understand this is explosively difficult difficult yeah this is this final boss [ __ ] you just the Regal bro yeah this game separates men boys clothes almost [ __ ] up there the damn sword okay three swings [Music] nice [ __ ] the tacky we win no consent they'll consent [Music] so how many tries that take us while technically chinking not changing what am I saying cheating I was gonna say thinking and she at the same time [Music] 29 that's with the arrows that's with the air if I had no arrows would be impossible especially that one scene where you got to swim like five [ __ ] times but it gives you the mood yeah that's what I'm saying that's worth cheating basically 29 death so how much in our case do it be like in the arcades when I played it was like a dollar each and that was back then when games were like 25 cents to 50 cents that's why when I was a kid dude I was I was like way too poor and way too afraid to play this game it looked so insanely hard and it is hard it's basically memorization yeah here I'm gonna show you guys the actual actual arcade machine and I'll show you guys the ridiculousness of it a second I'm good oops Kevin gonna set up for us here the actual actual arcade version - version brain-dead for laserdisc games I got pretty much all of them [Music] you dragons lair of fantasy adventure - a as the actual cancer at least to tell you some stuff on the screen there's nothing on the screen there is nothing on the screen you literally just have to know definitely boys to men this is boys them into the extreme sometimes the screen will give you hints just to show mercy on you and believe it or not there is no pink in you there is no continue you will start from the beginning of the [ __ ] game if you lose all your lives [Music] boys the men I was boys the men honey lives per dollar it's between three and five four it depends on what the arcade owner is sets it to right but it's usually like three lives it's too oh it's too long for me to remember as a kid but like like I said like this kind of game was kind of like it was so pristine back then because like I say you stepped the arcade you see all these [ __ ] games like space invaders and Tetris and pac-man is [ __ ] and then you see this game here like wow like this game is amazing you know it is just so expensive and so difficult right but it was a very amazing game yeah so if you--if you had the game of completely memorized I mean I guess you can show off to people and show them the whole thing but yeah okay uh we're gonna jump ahead now to 1984 we're gonna play time go and then we're gonna bounce back to space ace so let me a sort of time go here you [Music] so I showed you guys a little preview of time go on the Sega Saturn but like I said most laserdisc games the ports of laserdisc games are most of them are pretty bad the only good ones are ones that came I reported to PlayStation 1 or higher or PC but for the most thing you gotta use that emulation you should just do straight image because anything that's poured over two Sega CD or Sega Saturn right is most of it is garbage there are really bad ports how did you play laserdisc games there's a there's a laser the specific laser discs emulate emulator called Daphne you got to use that okay you before we get picture okay good we're good so this is the actual arcade version we're playing right now but it does have on-screen prompts so this is the actual arcade version come on make sure the volume is good for this [Music] start by blasting your ears [Music] so this will be tough because once again I don't think we have continues in this but at least we have on-screen prompts guys it was a different time it was a different time a different time

already know what we're gonna pick [Music] there we go there's worship oh I love the music already oh [ __ ] [Music] energize their Rashid Oh ah [Music] I like how you still I was like when he's the kid he's like still like super hardcore you know [Music] holy [ __ ] look at the sequence aha boy is here [Music] [Music] I thought money was ease [Music] No [Music] dude I have a fraction of a second in confession get ready and ready what you want to hold it down or something I think at the hold it down or there might be another button that I don't know about what the [ __ ] I'm gonna mash it [Music] what okay it must be a different key or something left am i pressing left's you got you guys see a left arrow I just see energized that's all I see cuz the left is lining up oh maybe you're right no don't know I don't see you left I just see the gun that's it maybe it's a different key we don't know about athos spacebar though because it's left on the animation oh right it didn't tell us though that's odd maybe the game [ __ ] up there and it gave us the wrong command yeah we'll just remember that for next time good I though it seems like every time it says energized we can't use the gun if maybe it's like only if we have it we can skip a cutscene yeah because I didn't use it I just press it up instead there it's hard for me to read the chat score very hard OC house really use my gun there [Music] Oh Wow and it has a different button maybe if control I'm going to guess this controller okay so if it just shows the gun its spacebar and if it says energized I think it's control I press spacebar backs and there we go we get lots of the funds control doesn't work I don't know the controls are we can't get further if we don't figure out what the damn control is for this unless we don't fire and it's one of those things again where we have to wear the right lights up okay thanks I was just about to say unless be at the Dodge [Music] you [Music] Wow wait wait holy [ __ ] I can't imagine what the arcade version of this game is like [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] just check the PC version guys if you can help you find the controls for the energizer it's not control I try control could be alter something or shared [Music] [Music] nice Jesus this is such a long cutscene look at this this is [ __ ] crazy what's going on Oh No don't timing the game is frozen that's the end like this you you die Gigi you you see vertices kind of bugged we always have the original arcade version would you like to exit no continue you and inserts coin it's not a [ __ ] arcade port I see the pause symbol that just brings up the options I think it's [ __ ] guys you guys find out what the other control was No Oh No there's that tons of controls [Music] / let me try relaunching again real quick just in case if it doesn't work then we could try the arcade version but it would be impossible it would be virtually impossible without knowing the directions because you [ __ ] impossible [Music] Oh Oh you could continue maybe this will work where is the same this is yeah this is seen before see if it goes further yeah this week this scene is so [ __ ] long I couldn't imagine spending a dollar on this [ __ ] [Music] please work it's thought it's actually [ __ ] dude no this port sucks what should we do what should we do there's a million parts of this game though I'm sure I can find another port or another stream a mill there's a million ports of this game ok we'll try one more time on a new on a fresh thing and we'll see what happens if it doesn't work then we can try the arcade roll Avenger what you're glad come out though you guys are breaking the rules without rules here you guys now that we've played one laser at this game you guys want to play them all can't do that in the 90s see a 90 then you guys got asked me to play mad dog and then Johnny Rock you can play all that in one stream no can't we can't just indulge in a single stream like that guys there's rules that's trying to game I put the move beeps on this time we change the difficulty maybe you think that won't make a difference [Music] I was just gonna say both of those oh okay whatever will I'll put it the captaincy it makes a difference so you said slash for energized [Music] now I didn't do anything we do not know what the energized button is [Music] master ik nice [Music] how the hell my people say that key [Music] aha boys here [Music] you [Music] then um have my keyboard doesn't have a numpad so that makes a lot of sense oh nice we're a man again no oh my god always back here

energize because we do not know what the key it is and the chats trying to figure it out we do not know what he is there's a PC port some boards are saying hit any button the energized pops up I'll bet it does [ __ ] [Music] okay here comes the glitch glitch cutscene [Music] [Music] nice [Music] oh it continued no not the [ __ ] energized key is I don't know where to go they just use they just suicide on me yes they sent me back the Street Fighter 5 he beat it [Music] oh I don't know what we pressed [Music] don't lose oh [ __ ] shallow link oh no it's another [ __ ] energized thing again

Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation. I'm Betty White, and I think we're going to have a good time today! At least I know I am. I'm going to be reading you a book, okay. I love animals, all animals, but maybe dogs in particular. So today, I'm going to be reading you a story about Harry the Dirty Dog. It's by Gene Zion, pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham. Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting a bath. So, one day, when he heard the \nwater running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush... and buried it in the backyard. Then he ran away from home. He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty. He played at the railroad and got even dirtier. He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still. He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all. In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots. Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away. He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way, he ran back home. When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence \nand sat looking at the back door. One of the family looked out and said, \"There's a strange dog in the backyard... By the way, has anyone seen Harry?\" When Harry heard this, he tried very hard to show them he was Harry. He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped. He rolled over and played dead. He danced and he sang. He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said, \"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry.\" Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped. He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously. Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks. He'd found the scrubbing brush! And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house. Up the stairs he dashed, \nwith the family following close behind. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. \"This little doggy wants a bath!\" cried the little girl, and her father said, \"Why don't you and your brother give him one?\" Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had. It worked like magic. As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting, \"Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick! It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry!\" they cried. Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy. His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots. It was wonderful to be home. After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place, happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty. He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow. Did you like that? \nWell you're going to like this even better. This is my friend Ringo. I just met him, but he's a shelter puppy who found a wonderful forever home, so he has a happy ending just as Harry the Dirty Dog had a happy ending. Thank you.", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what my sister's doing because it looks so fun oh so good were the beers oh goodness she's looking at

area of italy to taste some grignolino now you might have you might be asking yourself um what is a grindelino um i kind of frankly i was asking myself that the same the same thing um a couple of years ago and then i ran across um one in a tasting really enjoyed it and um then was watching um my friend from uh my friend kiara hill who we had on as in a conversation earlier and she was doing a master class on wines of piedmont and the grinnellino that she was tasting you know sounded so great that i went out and grabbed the bottle and figured a chair with you guys and see and give you an idea of some other light red wines that you can use you know to uh change up your pinot noir routine so as you can tell it's it's i don't know if you can see it but you know the the color on this wine is um you know it's pretty light so it does have it you know if um if i were to compare it to a wine that's familiar to you definitely you know pinot noir would definitely be you know one of those um wines to point to i think um you know beaujolais right gamma wines would would work and then if you've ever had a which is another wine from the northern italy um or a zweig gelt i think which is a wine from austria austria um light red wines you know you can throw them in the fridge for putting a light chill on them and they're really you know they're really good so let's see what this one um brings actually oh i'm skipping ahead so we are drinking here 2019. francesco rinaldi and sons uh or infidelity uh greenlino diosti so the greeniolino is from the osti region and um no this is not the franchesca rinaldi um pasta sauce people i it might be actually now you think about it um it's definitely possible that they are related i will do some research and also i mean who doesn't remember the commercials from the uh 70s and 80s ciao francesco rinaldi as i got older i got better ciao francesco rinaldi all right sorry back to the wine let's taste let's see what this brings to the table it's sort of um it's got a there's some cherry definitely cherries right candy cherries in here um i think there's also what's coming across to me is like a a creamy note which is which is interesting and when i opened this yesterday there was a distinct like floral note to the nose but i'm not getting that today interesting all right let's give it a taste it's actually got better on the second day the first day it was a little had a little too much minerality to it so it was sort of coming across a little bitter this is definitely softened and it's it's that those creamy cherries creamy cherries are what i'm getting and this is um it's pretty nice i'm liking it i'm really liking it i mean you could you think about it in terms of you know when you would break this out this is something you notice i don't have the um my popcorn cup with me these wines are only 13 alcohol they're really light easy to drink so you don't have to worry about um you know knocking yourself silly with a glass or two um perfect as we get into some warmer weather like i was saying earlier you can even do a light chill on them and um you know they'll be uh they'll be really nice um so that's about it i look forward to more wine and drink sessions with you and uh cheers until next time it's actually pretty good oh my god choke i have a little more good lord what's interesting is they said it's francesca ronaldi barolo i guess they had extra corks so they put it in their greniulino nice work [Music] you", "cDwgUU27NwA": "okay guys i just want to um do a quick disclaimer um before this video first um if you're not a medical patient or live in a legal country or state et cetera um leave bye i'm sorry but like you're not welcome here um anyways so if you're not supposed to be here leave and then the other thing is i my scale wasn't working properly for some reason and um i couldn't probably measure how much i was putting in the soup and um it turned out really badly like it turned out good but i consumed way too much way too much so like you can almost take this as an educational um a video on the effects of being dumb me i'm the dumb one because i'm like yolo um who cares i can tolerate it i could not tolerate it i could not bad bad bad bad okay anyways sorry for this long intro but i really want to stress you guys make sure you're not putting too much in there make sure you know your dosing okay i'm going to put a video below that can explain how to figure out how much you're consuming um but there's so many different ways to figure it out you don't have to watch my video my video is very long it explains it in a lot of detail but um yes please um be careful don't end up like me so i don't know how to explain this because i'm like pretty high right now but the after effects of the soup very dramatic okay if somebody had a low tolerance this would like destroy that like so there's a lot of video i'm just trying there's a lot of video so i just decided to make a separate video so this video is just about how to make soup and then the next video that i like stop stop what am i saying stop where was i oh my god my eyes are they red i don't get red eyes no they're not red anyways i'm checking i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so i regretted my decisions literally every minute here we go what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to show you guys how to make infused noodle soup instant noodle soup to be precise but you could use any type soup that you like because really what we're making is an infused water and fat solution and with that infused water and fat solution you can make anything you like what i happen to be having is the soup like i said but you could use it for tea you could use it for um you could add like um um flavor like a flavor packet to it like um you got iced tea powder to it and they a infused iced tea you could drink it straight um so let's get started because it's going to be sitting on here for a while so i'll talk a little bit more about it once we have it cooking so we're gonna start by turning our stovetop on and i have two cups of water here and i'm gonna pour it in now i'm using two cups of water because that's what my instant meal packages call for um but this water is going to evaporate over time and you can add more water to your liking it's not really going to affect um how the product turns out so use one or two cups and add more water as you like but it's better to have less water than too much um because you can literally add more water any point so i'm just gonna put this aside while it's heating up and what we need to infuse our soup is um some decart cannabis now this is just a bag from before it was the carbs but i'm just keeping it in there and i need fats okay so you can't extract the thc from the flour in the water on its own you need fat for it to bind to so you could use coconut oil you could use sesame oil which is what i'm going to use because i like to taste sesame oil with my um uh instant noodles um and if you didn't want to use this for soup like i said because you can use this for tea you can use this for anything i would recommend something more like coconut oil because it has a more mild flavor um taste whatever but yeah so you could use this and make an iced tea with it right like that would be good actually that would be really good i think i might do that i am going to be using peanut butter and soybean oil for it's not soybean sesame oil for my um fats for my soup because when i make my instant noodle and i might accidentally call it mr noodle because in canada it's kind of just like the the go-to brand and i in my head i call this noodle but um i add peanut butter and um sesame oil to it anyway and they're both fat so this is like the perfect solution um i add a bunch of couple things that make it taste like so good um and i'll add it after but uh you don't need to you just need a fact okay any kind of fat coconut butter soy bean sesame olive peanut butter doesn't matter butter okay so we don't need this coconut oil because i was just showing that uh for demonstration purpose says options and then you're going to need um instant noodle packages package singular um or you know mr noodle not my stranger that's what this uh chicken noodle soup or chicken noodle soup mix or any type of soup mix or anything you want to add to your cannabis water so while we have this heating up here i am going to add in my fats so i'm going to start in by adding about a tablespoon of my sesame oil and i'm not measuring it because it doesn't really matter that much because i'm going to be adding probably more fat than i need anyway um but i think i'm gonna add about a tablespoon of peach so we have our tablespoon of i'm gonna keep calling the wrong thing sesame oil which smells and tastes so good and i'm gonna add a tablespoon ish of um peanut butter actually more than a tablespoon because i really like peanut buttery taste in my um soup so this is more than a tablespoon but this is how much i'm adding and the water's not warmed up yet so that peanut butter is not going to fall off just yet so i'm just going to leave my spoon in there so it can melt off until it warms up okay so we got our fats in there and now we need to add our cannabis in so i am going to be a little bit extra here and um oh well you'll see what i'm doing but um you can put your canvas in there one you can put it all straight in there and um not strain it out and eat the cannabis flower left over whatever but like i don't want that i'd rather strain it and there shouldn't be much thc left in it by the time you're done with it so there's really um that's not necessary so you're gonna at the end a lot of people um will run it through a strainer or they will um put it through cheesecloth or et cetera et cetera but i it just seems like i feel like we could do this an easier way right um so i went to the dollar store and tried to find something that would work um like a deep sitting mesh whatever this is called but i couldn't find any so i bought this one and i'm going to cut it and you could use like a big tea thing like this and the reason why i'm doing they do make smaller ones that would have fit in here but i wanted to have like as much uh i wanted it to like be able to like float freely right i didn't want to have the cannabis all like stuck in one spot if i feel like it's gonna extract better when the liquid and the fat is able to like fully get on all um sides of all the cannabis so i bought this and i have my uh wire cutters i think they're called and i'm going to cut the mesh out like obviously you can cut your fingers doing this so be careful okay our water is um starting to simmer and heat up and we don't want this to be boiling we want it to be simmering so i'm going to turn the heat down now to a low-ish heat hello-ish medium so it's simmering but not boiling okay no matter how hard i try like no matter how hard i try i cannot cut it with the wire cutters um maybe they were just not good enough so i got these like plier things and i'm like just pulling it out of the like just completely taking it out this is like just maybe do this like outside or somewhere because there's little pieces of uh metal or mesh coming off so i'm just gonna finish this outside the easiest way to do this would have been to do it um in the pot when there was no liquid in it but i wanted to do it on camera but yeah that way then you could kind of like shape it uh you could shape it to the pot and now we can put our weed in so i will post the link um below for both how to de-carb your weed and how to figure out how much thc is in it so you guys can figure out how much you want to put um if you're completely like unsure of how much to put you could put like about the same amount as you put for um the fat right so i have put like two tablespoons of fat maybe a little bit more and i'm probably going to add i'm going to add a little bit less than that but maybe like one tablespoon i'm going to do one brown so i had just decarb some weed yesterday i just did it in my leftover and then i just put it in here to keep it fresh so i'm just going to weigh this out my scale male functions and that was definitely more than one gram it's probably like two grams but um i have high tolerance if you don't have high tolerance start low and be more careful with it but if you do have a high tolerance you're probably fine like me to just take your chances i'm not recommending you do that i'm just saying i'm just saying let's get all the rest of that and again we're not having our water boiling or having it simmering i'm just gonna put my crumbs does anybody else do that like take their crumbs and like put it in it's like kinda okay now all i have to do is let this simmer for 20 minutes to like a half an hour um and like i said and i'm gonna keep saying don't have it um boiling just keep it simmering and you can stir it around occasionally but you don't should be fine without it um but yeah just keep an eye on it and we're gonna cook this cook it for um about 20 to 30 minutes so here's how it looks we just have it on um what is it on it's on like three and a half there it's a little bit too high to be honest i'm gonna lower that a bit because this is that's actually like on the verge of boiling there so we'll turn that down and make sure all of the flour is submerged because it's my mesh thing um it's kind of getting stuck on the side so maybe i honestly don't know how good of an idea this mesh thing was sometimes i i think i have like really good ideas and then i try and execute them and like and like trying to see it from like outside perspective and i'm like they're probably thinking this girl's dumb but um we're on crack i i've definitely been told that people call me crackhead all the time on my youtube videos i can't help that actually yeah i can okay um i don't know i still like it and i wasn't gonna waste my four dollars i spent on that mesh since i already started taking it apart you know also why do i always say no okay we've been cooking for about 20 minutes and i think i'm going to do another 10 minutes why you ask i don't know just because i'd rather get more than less you know oh my god if i say you know one more time i swear okay i'm gonna try and see how it tastes to see if we can see how it's going oh my god the embarrassment this mesh thing is i don't know what i was expecting it tastes like that's literally oil and peanut butter yeah ten more minutes okay i'm gonna prepare my other ingredients for it to make it extra delicious also i don't really smell it but at the same time i'm used to it so so since it's almost done i'm going to add in my other ingredients um this isn't necessary for anything other than flavor right so like skip if you want but if you want something tasty and you like like peanut based and like spicy and like yummy add these wow english okay but yeah you don't have to add these things this is just because this is how i like my stupid taste you could add oregano you could add parsley you could add onion you could add you could make a whole soup you could add carrots you know um but then you have to strain them out so that's a whole issue i would wait till after so i do some honey okay a little bit more i know you like honey ew but i love my sweet and sour i mean you can barely taste honey then we have rice vinegar a little splash of rice vinegar and then i'm gonna do some soy sauce and some chili flakes too after we'll grab those flakes i love flakes so we're almost done we're at about 30 minutes or just about 30 minutes and it's looking really good it's smelling good and shortly we're just gonna take it off of the strainer so i believe it's safe to say that this strainer thing was the dumbest idea i've ever had because i could have just put the strainer over the bowl and poured it embarrassing okay so it's been on here for like a little bit over 30 minutes taking it off simmering the whole time not boiling i stirred it around in my bowl i have frozen broccoli because i'm not eating very many vegetables these days because i'm lazy and i figured out frozen broccoli is a great addition to the noodles but not when noodles are by themselves but when you add those ingredients i said mm-hmm like so good so so so good i'm gonna be using my mr noodle spicy chicken mr noodle is like a popular instant ramen i used to say raymond until one day i figured out it wasn't raymond it was ramen like how embarrassing how many times you think i said that out loud everybody loves raymond you know okay so i'm going to take this out i'm honestly embarrassed about how stupid this idea was so dumb and i'm good i'm going to put it back in the bowl which i could have done this the whole time and i'm going to pour my um soup and i'm just uh oh my god i forgot to add the noodles and the seasonings so at this point this is when you add your stuff i'm going to turn the heat back on because we gotta cook these noodles a little bit um and if you weren't making noodles and you're making a tea or whatever you could um you could put this coconut oil and water combination in like a jar put it in the fridge and then you could pull it out and warm it up and make some tea with it or add some water enhancers whatever so just add my noodle how am i gonna strain the noodles out okay maybe this wasn't that bad an idea after all so put my noodles in this video is definitely like i could have been like a three minute video instead of whatever this is going to end up being um please tell me what you guys think would you have liked if i when i realized how stupid of an idea this mesh thing was if i would have like just completely took it out of the video and like pretended this never happened or do you guys enjoy watching me mess everything up i don't know let me know because i don't know okay so i'm just cooking my noodles in the water the juice um and there's actually less liquid than i wanted because um it evaporates pretty quickly if you're letting it simmer for like over half an hour so i'm just going to add some more water and i'm going to turn the heat up more let me show you guys what we're working with here watch me spill it noodles fat and liquid and you want to make sure when you're straining everything out like not that the fat would get stuck in here but the fat is what is containing most of the the thc right so you want the fat that's the good part so i'm just gonna cook my noodles and i'm gonna pour it into my um see you can even see some of like the fat stuck to the bottom of this so i'm just gonna try and press as much of that out as i can use my fingers here oh yeah yeah can you guys see that get all the good stuff i can't believe to waste that also you don't have to strain the flour out because um you could eat it i don't want to though just because i just don't want to and um i'm not serving this to anybody obviously otherwise like gross um i can't believe i almost forgot to strain that out just ignore me i'm so sorry i hope you guys don't hate this video okay for me my noodles gonna go wash my paws and then we're gonna eat and then i'm gonna show you guys how it's like when i'm done and it's kicked in a few hours later i just need to show you guys like look at all that fat that's like the peanut butter and come on there we go like the peanut butter and fat mixture that i like squeezed out of um that remaining amount oh yeah look at those colors the green the pink that looks good okay our noodles are almost cooked and we are almost ready to eat oh boy do you ever look tasty let me just let me try a little bit of that oh i hate human okay our noodles are cooked i'm gonna pour my soup here i am i'm gonna pour my soup into my bowl splashy splash i feel like we should scrape some of that up here i mean there's not really much to scrape i feel like that might be kind of like the the fat sitting on the edges but i don't like wasting things so i'm like i feel like i will just like i'll literally lick it after because i'm just like any bit that i can not waste better i'm very frugal i don't like wasting not like actually never mind okay yeah see there we go yay snack time i mean lunch bone apple tea i wonder if it's a good enough temperature because um the broccoli cooled it down a bit since it was frozen sorry so there's something in my teeth okay oh my god i forgot the seasoning mat so like this doesn't taste as good as usual what is going on what is wrong with me one second okay i got the mix you guys i'm sweating and dying your feet but i have to keep my clothes on usually i would like to take them off well like i'd wear like a smaller top because it's so hot and the windows closed so it's not so loud and noisy for you guys but then everybody's gonna complain about how i'm not wearing enough clothes like does it really bother you that much although it's interesting because it's usually only women who complain about what i'm wearing hmm oh my gosh i've never tried this sauce mix on its own but that reminds me when i was younger and i'd like really want to um uh i'd really want to you guys i haven't even ate this soup yet why am i acting like i have uh i used to love like eating them in the package when you like broke them up um and like put the seasoning eggs my mom didn't let me because i wasn't healthy you know i was like i wish i was allowed to eat that but it wasn't okay it smells like herbal soup let's give it a try temperature is pro oh yeah that's good very very good i never used to really like mr noodle or instant noodles but um can skip over me eating this if you like because i'm not gonna probably say anything that it's like information you need to know to make it this is more just for my peeps who my peeps for my friends my my best buds for my people who like are like i'm not functioning properly today i honestly could use some salt um and this looks like all the msg it already has i'm a salt addict i can't help it i honestly do want to add some more salt or maybe some soy sauce it would have been better with more peanut butter and honey but they're very high calorie and the soup is ready oh soy sauce is good by itself too yum but yeah i never used to like mr noodle because or instant noodles because i'm just like they're just not that good until i added like lots of peanut butter and it's just like game-changing peanut butter and then some acidity from the rice vinegar and the sweetness from the honey honestly it tastes better without the weed in it because like you can still taste it but um it does taste a little better than we but it's still good if you serve this to somebody they wouldn't be like is there weed in this they'd be like what's the unique herb you have in there i'm putting the broccoli for the broccoli like the perfect temperature to eat right away if you do i have the same things that i add add more peanut butter because um there's nothing like peanut butter and like spicy chicken spicy chicken was the flavor i chose of my soup um uh oh my god i'm so hot and the soup is hot i'm gonna open my window the temperature why is it so hot what temperature is it in here it's only 22 degrees what's going on oh yeah that's a look okay i'm gonna finish this off camera because and then i'm gonna report back once i feel like it has hit me i'm gonna let you guys know how it goes okay okay i'll see you guys anywhere between well i mean it's gonna be immediately after for you but it's gonna be like two hours probably for me depending on how fast it hits me actually i should have added some muscle than into this but since i didn't i'm gonna take a less than capsule to help the absorption absorption okay see you guys soon in a couple seconds now bye because of all the fat in here has been making me full a lot faster than usual but you know the fat is necessary for what we're looking for thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you are at the end please tell me um um thank you for staying with me to the end even through my um my struggling through the video am i struggling with words my struggling with ideas am i struggling with really the whole thing doesn't mean it didn't turn out it just i struggled that happened so and that's okay well like i said already i think but who knows

favorite unsalted crackers brother reed here yet again and people with us today as always we're joining back by our sidekick you guys know him as the box we also have with us today we have alexa when was ben and jerry's founded ben and jerry was founded on may 5th 1978 by ben cohen and jerry greenfield it is 42 years old 42 years old anyway guys as always it looks like it's that time it's time for other exciting insane super official thought-provoking straight edge food product reviews youtube's only true there's if i don't everybody where ben and jerry's punchline ice cream limited batch it says people it's got brown butter bourbon almonds uh chuckles of cherries chuckles of cherries so this is a netflix netflix taco takes on comedy as sears as we tight as we take making ice cream but neither of us takes ourselves too serious here's a punchy flavor to prove it we recommend pairing this lickable libation with any netflix stand-up special sitcom or funny movie netflix is a joke but this limited batch flavor isn't anyway guys we're gonna give this a review and see what it's all about so remember if you have anything you'd like read the box arch your legs review you gotta leave a comment below if we like that comment guys we might just pick it out and review your request next thumbnail looking forward to this limited batch of ben and jerry's ice cream all righty guys now i picked this up at kroger for three bucks so let's open it up here if it's not child proof that is it may be child proof it may be read proof i guess you could say and that's some good plastic i'm glad they really seal it up like that that's a good thing most people's not going to be eating this in their car so take it home and get you a knife and tire into it you know so there we go we got it that's good good sturdy package very impressed there from ben and jerry's let's see man oh it looks just like vanilla ice cream a little bit there as you can see nothing special it doesn't look like anything special does it let's get down into it here and see what we've got okay okay wow wow it's almost like they have the nuts very finely cut up inside of the ice cream [Music] they do that's clever isn't it very clever there's uh very finely the nuts are very finely inside of the ice cream very finely chopped up it's not like a big like a big almond it's very finely chopped up i like that very clever from netflix and ben and jerry's punch line flavor so this is probably gonna be a limited batch like they said it's not gonna be out long so i've always figured i've always seen ben and jerry's is a little bit overrated anyway people i think they're while they're good you know they're there's a little bit of cherry right there let's try this here it's like the cherries mixed inside of the ice cream you really can barley you can barely see it people you have to really look so they've done a great job people i was expecting to have like big size uh cherries in it and big peanuts but they've done a great job just you know chopping it up and mixing it right in the ice cream very nice very evenly done no doubt about that definitely a lot better than i expected people so overall people it's great flavor got the brown butter bourbon you can taste it the almonds are great it's good a little bit of cherries in it it's good ice cream it really is and i just said it was overrated well i think they're a little bit upready but it's good to see a company with just two people in it start a company and just do great at it so overall people i highly recommend it you can see the nuts if you look see the nuts all around it there it's pretty neat but overall people i'm going to give it a very solid is that a cherry right there you can see oh no what is that look at that people would that be a cherry i guess that would be yeah anyway people overall i'm going to give it a very solid score you know there really isn't any bad the only bad ice cream i would say that i've had people is ice cream that's out of date it's hard to find bad ice cream it really is so overall people ben and jerry's punch line ice cream vermont's finest is gonna get a very solid score of four stars it's good it's good so that's going to be the official review people as always thank you so much for watching me the box archie alexa we'll see you guys as always next time man that i was just i just could

klondike i didn't think they would put out anything new i thought they were just all about ice cream bars", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a

you guys so tonight we thought given that it's saint patrick's day we would maybe go ahead and do something green we're not very festive tonight callie yeah or not no well your shirt says happy oh my bracelet and your your bracelet's green your sweater this morning was green but i'm not very festive with my red and my black but that's okay we're making sure we are we are going to make a green shamrock shake because we love shamrock shakes we used to love shamrock shakes at mcdonald's mcdonald's when we used to eat mcdonald's we don't eat mcdonald's very often anymore now but we love their shamrock shake so we're gonna make the healthier version of the shamrock shake tonight for st patrick's day and then we also thought we would do another fun one we've been looking and eyeballing this recipe for a while yeah because cali she loves a good chewy candy she really does and she loves starbursts so we came across a strawberry it's supposed to be lemonade starburst fruit a super fruit super fruit food chew that is a tongue twister kelly can you say it better than i can starting lemonade limeade superfood chews hot you did better than me so we're going to make a couple of things for you and we're going to get started so kelly should we get started on the shake first do you want to shake first we'll do our green saint patty stay shamrock shake first i'll get some you want to grab the blender okay callie's going to get the blender just just the top no just the top yep yep okay bring it on over we can always go over there mix all righty so miss kelly you want to grab the ice i think we'll put the ice in the there's a bottom full in there yep so we've had this shamrock shake a few different ways sometimes we add chocolate and make it chocolate mint but tonight we're just gonna stick with the traditional shamrock shake i can't see any hold on let's see if we can get our comments nope we can't see any comments and it's not really showing us anything tonight so we don't know if we're having a technical glitch or not but can you say hello just so we know that our comments are working we're going to do six ice here should we double this recipe do you think we should share with your brothers and your dad okay okay so let's maybe double it these shakes are always huge i think doubling it will still give us lots so say a quick hello if you can hear us because we can't seem to see the comments right now i'm not sure it doesn't seem to be working well so yeah let's do 12. let's do 12 cubes so we're doubling the recipe for the sandbox shake so this shamrock shake is the low carb mint milkshake from brianna thomas so you can find it on her website and we will um post a link in the card somewhere oh the comments are working hello nice to see you thanks for commenting three four five six seven and we're being very precise tonight eight okay i'm gonna get your spinach ready okay so we're gonna put in a whole bunch of spinach to make a green you're daydreaming while you're doing that do you have a tough day long day at school maybe zoning out all right so we are gonna get the spinach ready hi julia um so we are going to put in so it's supposed to be one cup of loosely packed spinach but we're going to put in enough for two so two cups do you want to grab a measuring cup i'll grab a measuring cup you throw the ice away how's that done oh dear okay so we're gonna do some loosely packed we get a little generous on our spinach and our cheeks we really like having spinach on our shakes like you don't even notice you don't even know what's there right we had a chocolate hazelnut shake last night with supper it was kind of a strange color because of the spinach but that's all right we didn't mind right oh no okay two cups of spinach callie do you want to grab the almond milk yep yeah grab it grab the open one yeah that sounds good is this a open one nope i got it how much do i need you're gonna need we're gonna double again so you're gonna need it says half a cup so you're gonna need one cold cup you wanna just use this one that we've got out you might as well keep rolling with it [Music] can't join um what's that we gotta use until we can't anymore did you give it a shake good job i shook the other one oh you shook this one i think you're gonna need both i think you need both we kind of have a weird angle going here tonight yeah there we go until we get the tripod how is everybody doing on this st patrick's day anybody having green food our kids had green lunches they had uh spinach in their waffles for their school lunch so they had green waffles and they had micro greens and they had celery and green peppers was a real green lunch for school today any more this one's really fully let me give you a hand yes okay so how much did i say we were going to need one cup right once it's pretty like much like three quarters it's pretty close we might have to add some more depending on how thick this ends up okay cali next up the cottage cheese cheese you want to grab that yep all right callie's getting the cottage cheese i love the cottage cheese in these shakes because it is the perfect way to imitate ice cream in this shake so this is like a milkshake this one so you need the cottage cheese the traditional shamrock shake is actually ice cream based if you look at like ones that are not tma to thm they are actually ice cream based usually so i'll need a cup of this are you gonna need a cup actually that says a third so you're gonna need two thirds of a cup sweetie okay all right you got it oh i'll get you a tablespoon it smells interesting so it smells interesting does it smell like cottage cheese hopefully it's not smelling funky okay so you're going to need two for this side if it smells like cottage cheese we're doing the smell test it smells perfectly like cottage cheese to me i don't know what you're smelling but so we're using low fat cottage cheese just because that's what i tend to have in the house did it really callie read further into the recipe than i did apparently well it called for the low fat but this is an s shake so you could go full fat if you have it but i think we just don't want to get too crazy on our calories here with this shake no no need for it we like this one this one um again we've mentioned before we are in canada and we have some phenomenal cottage cheese if you buy the land one percent it tastes excellent if you buy the other one percent brands they're terrible so this is the one that we go with sitter probably be generous we like the cottage cheese in there you want me to hold it up so you can scrape it in get this in view so people can see you in action [Music] how's everybody's wednesday going it's hump day we're almost through the halfway point it is hump day right oh yeah yeah it is wednesday oh boy it's been a long week it's been a long long week one tablespoon mm-hmm keep going all right i'm gonna get the next ingredient ready we're gonna need some heavy cream and we are gonna need again we're doubling the recipe so we're gonna need four tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream you're getting close we're getting it all over the counter i don't care keep going keep it up good it's like the whole container is it pretty much the whole container oh not quite not quite that's looking good okay how about i take this from you and you can scrape that in i'm gonna grab the lid go all right we're going to get this put away [Music] maybe i'm going to wipe up your counter there too uh i'll just put this over here yeah you might need it again we'll find out okay so we're going to need to put in some cream and then do you want to grab the next day you're going to call us oh there we go yeah it's gone that's okay we can't take a call right now anyway next ingredient i'm gonna do the whipping cream so why don't you do the collagen okay okay so going back to this we are gonna need four tablespoons of our heavy cream to give it that nice ice creamy taste you got that that's really a big thing of collagen we love to get that huge thing of collagen at costco sometimes it goes on sale for a really good deal and it's it's really nice i like this one because it dissolves completely whether you put it in hot or cold it's really good at dissolving [Music] it's the organica yeah it's a really good one so i need a two tablespoon you need two tablespoons see if i can find one we need to get some more measuring spoons i feel like every time we do a video we're like we need to get that we need to get that we need to make a list just what we need to do we need to make a profit i think we needed scoops in one video we need measuring spoons there's a few things our kitchen is kind of lacking or some things are just showing their age because they were wedding gifts almost 15 years ago my husband and i all right the kitchen stuff kind of got put on the back burner right replacing all of our gadgets okay it doesn't have to be super precise in a shake you don't have to be quite as precise when you're baking you got to be pretty pretty particular but in a shake it's more forgiving so don't worry too much all right where's everybody watching from tonight yeah we are yeah we want to know this is your first video watching us we are in saskatchewan canada and it's a beautiful day we finally have less temperatures that are significantly on the plus side the snow is almost all melted four teaspoons of this it's awesome today four teaspoons okay we're gonna use this super sweet do you say four teaspoons okay kelly's gonna measure in the fourth because it's normally two teaspoons i'm gonna go ahead with the extracts so we are gonna need vanilla extract and we're also gonna need now it did call this recipe actually calls for dried mint but we don't have dried mint in the house and we don't have a garden going yet in the backyard for fresh mint so we are going to go ahead and just use the pure peppermint extract too bad we didn't have like any mint leaves i know we've done mint before in our pots on our back deck and it's been awesome we did mojito mint the one time and we used that for our kombucha and it was so good newport richly oh nice from florida i bet the weather in florida is nice okay kelly i'm gonna go ahead with this and i'm just gonna i'm gonna do we're gonna start with two capfuls we'll see if that's pepperminty enough and if it's not minty enough for our shamrock shake then we'll increase it we can always increase it but i find the mint is pretty powerful can't take it away you can always put more in and i just got it all over myself it's a good thing it smells good okay i'm gonna wash my hands i'll keep this out because we'll need it do we need it again oh this is the super sweet maybe if it's not sweet enough i guess but i don't like i'm pretty sure we don't need it for our other recipe it's just for this one okay so then we're going to add some vanilla and we're going to go through the dash so we're going to add we're going to be generous i love it okay don't worry about that one right now kelly let's just do this one okay so do you want to do the salt it says pinch so maybe do a cup of cranks like i'm gonna do like one crank well it says a pinch so that would be like one pinch and you're doubling it right perfect okay now we have to add the glucky but we have to do it while it's whirling because otherwise we might get it lumpy this stuff as soon as it hits the anything moist anything wet um it clumps up so badly so we are gonna do that over the thing maybe i should bring it over and we can blend it right up here how's that sound okay okay you guys should check out our youtube channel oh you think everyone should go to youtube yes we do have a youtube channel now and we would love if you go over and you go ahead tell them what it's what it's called i'll get the blender donut and okra donut okra yeah and let's grab this people say ogre's a vegetable and it shows it's seeds so i wonder if it's like a frenchy a fruit or a veggie a fredjie as frenchy as a fruit and a veggie oh you mean because okra has seeds in the inside and cucumbers are a fruit because they have seeds on the inside i don't know we might have to google this whether okra is truly a vegetable or whether okra is a fruit or a veggie is it freddy a true thing yeah i figured this is a made up kelly thing a frenchie a thread or a vegetable whatever it is we love it you could put okra in this shake too but we're just going to stick with the way the recipe is written because the okra would probably be tasted in this recipe but it would certainly give it a really nice puddingy milkshake texture we love the texture of okra in our shakes okay do you want to get this started kelly it's going to be super thick so i'm going to get the plunger it's gonna be loud [Music] we want it to be green it's a shamrock shake it's the perfect green okay if you want to grab a scraper we'll scrape down the sides we have a few little tiny chunks of of cottage cheese and a spinach on the side and that's not going to be very nice yeah you want to scrape down those little pieces of cottage cheese and spinach we might actually have to add some more ice we kind of decreased the ice because our ice cubes are big but we might have to increase the ice we'll see we're going to put that glucky in glooky lucky i still haven't figured out if it's glooky or glucky i'd really like if somebody would tell me if it's glooky or glucky so we could be saying it right or lucky yeah i don't know we said glucky for like two years already so now it's hard for me to get that out of my head i want to call it glooky still you want to call it glooky like no lucky clucky gucky lucky and what we can call whatever we want i guess but i'd just like to know what it's really called it's like you scrape these down here we want those chunks of spinach to if you say if it's like if it's glooky can you say if the two o so we can tell it's like okay so cali wants to know if it's glooky or it's glucky or it's glucky like lucky lucky we really want to know somebody tell us somebody help us out okay so i'm going to sprinkle it in i think you just splashed me oh sorry well you'll smell minty you'll be very festive okay i'm gonna sprinkle it in how much did we need hon we need a quarter of a teaspoon for one recipe rounded and we're gonna do double so we're gonna need half a teaspoon around so we're gonna make some noise again and i'm going to sprinkle it in super slowly get it going anytime this hits the liquid it's going to start forming these little rubbery balls of clump it's not very appealing oh she thinks it's like lucky lucky that's what we were hoping lucky so were we saying it right for those two years what did we say before i can't even remember now i think we said we said lucky yeah we said right the whole time so baby we're saying it right well thanks for helping us out letting us know what we should be saying there brandi okay cali so let's add a couple more ice cubes do you want to grab the ice back out it's looking a little thin we want it nice and thick like a true shamrock shape it's gotta be thick perfect maybe add well originally it said we should add eight and you added six right six times two so go ahead add four more let's go the original amount we should have just followed the recipe and done the eight cubes like it said all right i said wrong not lucky oh not lucky oh oops so it isn't lucky it's glooky with two o's like that sound lukey no i'm just confused glooky we're gonna have to retrain our brains callie okay [Music] so now what it said to do is it said once you've got your glucky in there you're supposed to just like let it sit 30 seconds to a minute let that glue activate and then put it back on again and it's supposed to give it the best texture i don't know i'm not a very good rule follower i have a tendency to just throw it all in there why don't you get us some glasses and some straws so yeah i'm not really a rule follower when it comes to the shakes i know many of them say add the protein powder in the last 10 seconds and i'm not so good at following that we like a fluffy shape so we don't we just usually all throw it all in there all right can you reach out get rich our fridge is way too full considering it has nothing in it can you reach it do you need me to grab one yes i don't want a glass to fall on your head no that would have hurt you're going to use that one okay sure you can use that one i'll use this one these oh this looks good let's see look how nice and shamrock shape and it smells like i think we got it had a really minty maybe you could have cut it back we ended up doing half i did two capsules so probably closer to half a teaspoon and it probably definitely could have been more like one one and a half capfuls but we like minty so a shamrock shake should be minty right callie we said we were gonna make for the boys we should better save some hey uh-huh we better just you're having less sure i guess i'm having less it's all right i'll have more if there's enough for everybody to go around let's give it a try um it's really good oh it's really minty i really like it but i honestly i would like to add okra to this i think the texture would be even more milkshake like if you added okra so i think the next time we're going to add two cups of okra one cup per recipe um yeah um you know those um things that you can find at sweet and sprouted which things are we talking about those make your own ice cream package yes you could make some of those and then put it in you totally substitute some of the ice you totally could so kelly thinks next time we make the shamrock shake we should make some homemade sugar-free vanilla ice cream and plop it in there and that's a great idea it would taste even more like a true shamrock shake okay we're gonna hop to our next recipe another really quick one and this one is our strawberry lemon we're calling them lemon limeade because we're out of lemon juice and we do have the strawberry lemonade packets so we're going to use one of these you have the same brown as this for the yeah we normally buy the same brand so we're going to do the strawberry lemon limeade starburst superfood chews um so if you follow in the trim healthy book the superfood chews i believe are in the original trim healthy cookbook but there's not this recipe this recipe was just found on the page on the trim healthy main page so i will still link it in the comments so you can see it there so it's just somebody tweaked the original recipe which is normally a chocolate one and there's a few other variations and we're gonna do a strawberry lemonade hardly any of this stuff that's okay we won't quite have enough of the strawberry protein powder but we will add a little plain two and a half scoops scoops oh this scoop is what you just dropped off of there let me move this out of the way and then we can bring the food processor in and then you can get started on it i can tell you guys kelly is chomping at the she loves starburst if you have any like really good cheap fruit processors food processors yeah we talked about that last time our food processor is very sad when we do one of these videos with it one day it's just going to give us the ghost because it's very old that's okay hopefully it won't be today hopefully it's gonna it smells like strawberries it's a strawberry yeah don't dump it we don't have a lot especially strawberry starburst well that's the goal here we're trying to make something that tastes like strawberry starburst do you want me to just dump it in if you hold the scoop over we'll do it as teamwork okay okay so you're gonna need for these starburst fruit chews oh we've got glooky again oogie i think it says goofy yeah we have to start saying it right callie we're gonna embarrass ourselves saying lucky a hundred times i think i just like that it sounds like a lucky i don't know okay so we need to think that should you maybe we should just call it oh we could call it lucky good point cali okay so we need two and a half scoops of the strawberry trim healthy mama we're using their strawberry protein powder you could probably use a different strawberry one if you've got it use what you've got we're just using what we've got which is apparently not enough one and a half so don't dump that yet because we're gonna top it up we're gonna need two and a half all together so we're gonna need some plain we've just got the plain this is just the trim healthy mama plain protein powder we are in desperate need of going for a shopping trip kelly because that's all i've got left for protein powder in the house and that's like a tragedy okay so we're gonna need two and a half this stuff's fluffier i wonder if they're gonna turn out different with the plane in there oh well we're gonna find out so that's two and then we need another half well maybe the other one's not so fluffy because they don't have it the other one is less fluffy because of flavor i'm not sure why the flavored trim healthy protein powders are less fluffy than that do we need glucose we need no we don't no we need uh collagen you want to grab the collagen one more time and we did have this from our previous recipe that we used it for collagen let me get these other dishes out of the way callie one half see it isn't see me does it mean cup cup yes a c in a recipe would mean cup oh oh half a cup honey so not the table food what's that oh yes not the tablespoon i'm totally wrong you are right i think callie's reading the recipe we have a cup of collagen there's a lot of collagen hence what makes them super food chews there's the half cup cali get some of that in there this is almost like the strawberry really dip it in here turn this like that sideways i'll hang on to it for you this is almost like the strawberry what protein powder because it's like oh the texture the collagen yeah it's the same half cup yep we want to be kind of more exact on this recipe because we want them to turn out where they stick together okay perfect and then we need to see the star ingredients which is going to be floss tea lucy lucy lucy they say glooky they say everybody says something different apparently yeah that's all right i'm gonna call it lucky that is so so so minty next we're going to try it with the dried mint like the recipe calls for see if it makes a difference because i really like that that's the difference between her recipe so okay we're gonna use in this case the recipe calls are you okay you bump your almonds it called for these the true lemon lemonade don't be mistaken and just buy the true lemon that are just the crystallized lemon you need these to be the lemonade mix and there's all different flavors so you could change this recipe i got two more in my hand i need a cup so you can use whatever flavor you want and change the flavor of your starburst fruit shoes to be whatever flavor you buy there you are dear cali is on a mission tonight we are on mission make this video short nice and short we're gonna try and be quick tonight one it smells like strawberry night kelly's gotta head to the bath after this it's like a purple color it is um that smells good this is a real life school weeknight kind of video we gotta be fast right kelly gotta go chop chop so i'm excited if these are good we're gonna buy more of the true lemon packets and do different flavors and we're gonna make a whole like mixture so when we've got those cravings for something chewy and candy-like we can be chomping on these her it's really perfect no there's a good chance cali we'll test it before we completely decide we like the flavor but we used some plain protein powder so there is a chance this might not be just a second okay there's a chance this might not quite be sweet enough because we didn't use all strawberry protein powder we did have to sub some plain in there so we're gonna taste it when it's done and if we need to we'll either add some super sweet or we will add another packet of the lemonade so we're going to have to just be careful of that don't let me forget to try it isn't lemonade like sour yes but there's also sweetener in this this is already pre-sweetened this one it's got um well there's actually cane sugar in here but it's just such a minimal amount and there's stevia leaf extract in there okay callie so it said you're supposed to combine all of this first blitz it up a little bit just so it's all combined evenly so that you're not getting like some that just tastes like collagen pulse it um you just whizz it on low maybe give it a quick whiz go ahead smells like it's burning i don't smell burning i smell lemonade no like when it was whirling then it smelled like oh dear that's just because our food processor is dying okay so to this cali we have to add some lemon juice and then we're gonna process it a little more and then add our coconut oil oh yes the lime juice we're gonna do lime juice because we're out of lemon so two table two tablespoons you can use that tablespoon measure over there extra collagen no all right collagen for what because i have like a little less oh that'd be fine that little tiny bit in the spoon will be fine i'm gonna let callie do the cooking video and i'm just gonna drink the shade give it a good shake those things when they're kind of new you have to yep you're getting it keep going [Music] keep going you're able to see this one you want it to be a bit more precise so that they stick together good keep going keep going a little bit more perfect one okay go ahead with one more we need two tablespoons it's bubbly in there add the lime juice or you could use lemon juice and two tablespoons of coconut oil i'll get the coconut oil started cali okay i'll get it ready to go but i'll wait actually because i don't want to interrupt you and i need to have a measuring spoon excellent i'm just gonna grab a spoon for the coconut why is it bubbly in there in here it's probably reacting with the um the packet of the lemonade that'd be my guess okay i'm going to grab something like that and vinegar yeah sort of like that okay so you need to begin processing and it says says when you put the juice in you need to start processing it like online like on low what no lime juice it smells like really like lemonade oh it smells really good and it's a little crummy it's supposed to be crumbly at this point it's supposed to be crumbly that looks right i'm using kind of a one and a half tablespoon measure and then a half tablespoon because again that's all we have for measuring spoons around here is random random ones so we're gonna use this one is a half so that'll give us two tablespoons of coconut oil i don't think you want to use a coconut oil that has much flavor here we're using this one this one's our favorite you see it there um it's ideal for cooking the omega nutrition one it has no coconut taste whatsoever i just got a sugar so it's my favorite to use i like coconut but i don't want coconut starburst that's it oops it actually sounds sort of good coconut starburst well that'll be your next creation maybe kelly okay so that you want to whizz it up again and we'll check if it holds together okay now be careful for the blade we gotta check if it's gonna just be careful there's a blade in there we're just going to see if it holds together i think it's going to hold together it's very coconut oily but it seems to be holding together holding a nice little ball there it's like a little gumball yeah we want it to hold together taste it see if it needs anything that tastes really good it tastes like a strawberry starburst mm-hmm which is exactly like a strawberry lemonade starburst i don't think we need to add any more sweetener there is no such thing as strawberry lemon there's no strawberry lemonade starburst but that would taste like a strawberry one you know all the flavors i don't but i'll take your word for it okay so now you have a couple of options a person can either take just take your fingers like we just did and make little balls out of this or you can roll it into a log and slice it i think we should roll it in a log and slice it what do you think callie can i slice it sure you roll on too long okay i'm going to grab a cutting board to do this one because this looks like it might be pretty greasy from the coconut oil and we'll do it on a cutting board and then if you want to grab a knife there should be one check if there's one in that drip tray over there for doing the supper dishes okay so we're just gonna form this into a log it seems to be sticking together nice okay then you can grab one from this drawer but just let me roll this out first okay because you have to get in there a little bit of sausage it's very coconut oily like i feel like it kind of had a little less coconut oil it sounds very coconut oily anybody made this does it look right i think it's supposed to be like shiny i think it's just melting from my warm hands yeah but it's very very coconut oily you're not gonna wait hey no no you're eager i'll just use this you're gonna use that big chef's knife okay nobody can see you want to come on the other side of me yeah but i gotta roll this up a little bit this knife in the house be careful with it please kind of holding it dangerously there for a minute all right now we may have a problem because this is not really wanting to roll out nice and thin we may have to do some forming of it with our hands i think that's what we're going to do it looks honestly like all the coconut oil is coming out of this and that can't be right so we're going to try and improvise well if your hands are melting well we don't want to lose all the coconut oil in our recipe yeah right so if you want to cut in pieces they have to be kind of even pieces calisora they're somewhat the same size and then what maybe i'll do since this looks a little on the big side i'm just going to break that into two maybe we'll go ahead and just form these with our hands starburst yeah absolutely you cut them in or even you just cut some and then you can help me form them i think we should do them in little squares like starburst would look like little cute squares can you see that our lighting in our house in the evening is absolutely terrible so i apologize because it looks like we're in a cave right now yeah we have a light on the way so that the lighting will be a bit better because it still gets dark here really early it's only 7 30 and it's getting dark outside so we're gonna get something but can you see our little starburst fruit shoes aren't those the cutest we're gonna have very greasy fingers when this is done cali did you cut them into half again yeah they're gonna be pretty big i think kind of just make them form them into little cubes flat they're gonna be bigger than a starburst i feel like we could have even made these into half again oh my god well you make that one whatever size you want it but i think the rest will make them just like little tiny one bite poppers because these are super filling with all that collagen in there and that protein powder you know this is a one right one that looks like a huge bite one you'd be full after just having one really you don't want to slice it in half and make it smaller i can make it smaller that would fill me up with just one it would so i think it's fun to do these in different flavors i like i do like the chocolate ones they remind me of a tootsie roll so i do like those ones too although i do not remember them being so drippy with coconut oil so i don't know if that is something to do with the lemonade packets just not being quite the same as the original recipe there's less dry ingredients but i mean they're turning out they're just drippy with coconut oil do this over guys this is pretty small and try to make sure sure you do it whatever you however you like that looks great this one has to cut in half after i made it you're gonna make it a starfish mini sausage a mini sausage so i think these would be fun to do with the kids if your kids like to eat thm food my kids do you can like probably make these any shape you want these would be really fun to do as something the kids could get involved in doing it's like school safe they would be school safe we have a tough time finding school safe snacks that in our house is really important as well because we have a son with a peanut and a sesame allergy so it's really hard to find snacks that are safe for him that are both peanut free and sesame free sesame is the even harder one i think than peanuts these days is finding things that are sesame free so whenever we find something fun like this this would be a super cute little lunch box accompaniment are you trying it yeah you taste testing it no see if it's any good i think they'll be even better once they're cold we'll chill them and then all that coconut oil will firm up and then they will be super good because that's what i used to do with the traditional recipe they used to wrap them individually and then put them into the fridge so like you'd wrap them and then you put them in the fridge so yeah i don't want to chill these because i well we're not going to eat them all this is making a lot so we're going to keep forming these and enjoying them yeah right i'm not sure if we have too much else to show you guys tonight we want to keep this really short and sweet we just wanted to show you a fun shake for st patty's day so um if you're just starting

bye bye", "GNV6zt0xw1w": "welcome and thank you so much for joining us for another napa valley sessions we're really excited about tonight's session we have as of this morning attendees from 21 countries around the world come to learn about how to sell napa valley wines the goal of today's session is to provide an overview of not valley's top varieties particularly for members of the wine trade to help them sell our wines sell our wines to other members of the trade and to consumers around the world we particularly want to hone in on ways that we can help you discuss these wines with the little ways that we can help you talk about them describe them and compare them to other similar wines around the world to help us do that we've asked three prominent wine makers to share their opinions on what makes napa valley wines distinct this is the second in a three-part series that we're doing for members of the trade you can also catch our napa valley rocks seminar which was aired on march 2nd on our website and then join us in two days time for a discussion of napa valley's sub-regions and all three of these sessions together are to support a program that we're participating in called hop wine hopline is a virtual international trade fair so if you are an importer or if you're looking to expand your napa valley portfolio please visit hopwine.com to discover 23 napa valley wineries including all three that we have on the panel today please join them go to hopwine.com to browse the selections engage with those vintners and actually request samples of real wine to be mailed to you so that you can taste the wines and see if they work for your portfolio we are super excited about today's session and i'm super excited about our moderator for today's session natalie wang is a hong kong-based wine journalist who has worked and reported on asia and specifically the chinese wine market for more than five years she's recently founded vinojoy.com the only english website dedicated to covering covering the expanding and complex wine industry in china and asia her reporting on the drinks industry led her to win the young communicator of the year by cathay

founding vino joy she was the managing editor of drinks business hong kong and also james suckling.com and i had the privilege of meeting natalie a couple years ago back before all this covid stuff back when we were able to host trade in napa she visited napa with us back in october 2019 and it was a pleasure to show her the region and all of the fantastic wines that we produce so natalie i invite you to come on and um take it away from here great thank you so much connor for your kind words um i really enjoyed our visit to napa two years ago before the pandemic and i look forward to visiting napa again can't wait to have your team so long ago right yeah indeed um you know um at least now we have something to look forward to um thanks first of all for having me to moderate the session um i'll give everyone a brief introduction of napa valley before we go into panel discussion located just an hour north of san francisco napa without a doubt is the wine capital for america and perhaps the most renowned new world wine region most importantly for its high standard quality wines its polish style and in part the now famous 1976 judgment of paris organized by the recently deceased stephen superior that saw napa wines triumphing big names in bodo and burgundy but despite its reputation the land under vai in napa valley is actually quite small about 10 percent of napa county is planted with graves and napa only produces roughly four percent of california wines surprisingly um given its commercial success the region is only home to 475 wineries and 95 of them are still family owned napa only started winemaking roughly 200 years ago but it is the first aba in the u.s a title given to it in 1981 for its distinction in winemaking and history unique climate and tawa influenced by its proximity to the pacific ocean napa enjoys a dry mediterranean climate the dry summer allows grapes to ripen evenly slowly and ensures consistency of style year in and year out and in napa there are 16 different ava's each one has its unique climatical conditions the san pablo bay to the south helps bring in cool winds and moderate the temperature the two mountains the vaca mountain to the east of napa helps protect the vineyards from the intense heat from the central valley in the east and the maya chymas help block cooler marine influence from the pacific ocean in the west and in terms of grape varietals of course cabinet is the king here no other grapes have enjoyed such success as cab in napa valley but in fact there are more than 40 different wine grape varietals planted in napa county 21 of vineyard acreage is dedicated to white wines and 79 to red wines six of the top planted grapes in napa are cabernet chardonnay merlot pinot noir souvenir blanc and zinfandel today we're very lucky to have three panelists who are well versed in those grapes and have a wealth of experiences and expertise in making those delicious wines from napa valley they are sarah from pejo winery who has been with the winery since 2006 before joining pedro she honed her skills at kendo jackson and was voted napa's best wine maker two years in a row by napa valley life magazine so thrilled to have sarah here and then we have richie from rambauer vineyards born in adelaide in australia richie has experiences of making wines in australia new zealand before returning to california in 2004 he worked his way up as an assistant winemaker at rambauer to today's director of viticulture and winemaking so very lucky to have richie with us as well and last but uh not least we have matt from brand napa valley matt studied a y and viticulture at university and uh traveled far and wide to learn about wine in different regions and his curiosity of wine has led him to argentina south africa eden valley ultimately napa valley and matt worked at a little unknown winery called donna estate for years before joining brand napa valley to oversee the wine making at the winery so without further ado let's welcome all the winemakers on the panel and we'll start with sauvignon blanc hi hello everyone hi everyone hi great oh fantastic um so today we'll start with souvenir blanc um it is actually the second most widely planted white varietal in napa just after chardonnay and um all of you guys have experiences in your past uh work experiences and current job positions with souvenir blanc so i'll start with the the question what would be a typical souvenir blog in napa valley oh your um your mic is uh muted yeah okay someone needs to start um so welcome everyone i would say so here's the thing about napa there's so much diversity and so many um there's not necessarily maybe one specific style not only for just sauvignon blanc but probably for any of the varietals maybe we're consistent and it's a wonderful growing region we're very fortunate to be able to make wine here but um so i think because there's so much diversity you can find everything from more of the green herbaceous more new zealand style if you will all the way up to wines that are fresh and great acidity with more tropical notes two even sauvignon blancs that have some oak influence right so we all have different different ways of making it depending on where your sauvignon blanc grows so there's a lot of um different types of sauvignon blanc but i think you're going to find in general and i'm going to call it you know more than what i you know napa valley or maybe the california style tends to be and this is a generalization but bright crisp good acidity with um like for us more of the tropical notes more you know you're going to find some good citrus notes in there but with also some tropical pineapple um guyava too maybe even some peach or apricot notes to it i see it's quite interesting so in terms of wine making um how would you handle souvenir blanc so i i'll take it for a minute welcome everybody thanks for having me um yeah i mean kind of as sarah said with uh just the diversity of the topography and uh climate within the napa valley there's the same diver diversity and winemaking techniques so yeah you know my experiences range from anything between going for um you know picking early making that fresh style fermenting stainless steel tank um leaving it in that stainless steel tank bottling it early and you know kind of positioning a wine for early consumption all the way to maybe more of like a grove style um or a whole cluster basket pressing for example directly into barrels doing fermentation and new or neutral barrels um amphora clay terracotta amphora or uh concrete and um keeping those wines on leaves for extended aging i've aged soft blanc up to about 18 months and gone for more of an age-worthy grub style so again just a really wide range of techniques and and tools at our fingertips here um that we can that we can use well that's quite exciting because you know california and napa people are known for the fumey blanc that's pioneered by robert mondavi and of course you have the crispier style like sarah said as well maybe you'll ask richie as well because richie you're from australia you had experiences making sauvignon blanc in australia and new zealand and when you you returned to california how do you compare those two styles yeah i mean new zealand i mean if you look at probably the most famous style out in new zealand it's going to be mulron blanc and marlborough is significantly cooler than napa um apra as a whole uh for growing sauvignon blanc it's a little bit warmer the soils are very different you know if you look at the valley on the south side of marlborough that's going to have really rocky soils similar to something you see in cooked roti and the wines have a very uh high acid uh they're definitely uh the flavors are cut grass asparagus bell pepper or capsicum depending on your flavor or name and probably on the riper side you're gonna get gooseberry and blackcurrant bud whereas in napa i finally generally start at that gooseberry and black currant butter and we go through to those riper flavors like sarah spoke about and so we see white stone fruit maybe guava and some of the riper expressions tropical notes right oh i see when sarah arpeggio you have six different vineyard estates and souvenir blanc is planted in the northern part of napa in pope valley so how does the vineyard site selection define the style that you're making so for us so we have um i have sauvignon blanc planted in two of our vineyard properties and it is more on the northeastern portion of the napa valley which tends to be very warm and also um but very cool at night so much much cooler than maybe the valley floor um but definitely gets warmer which actually before i'm like i think that's a phenomenal place to grow sauvignon blanc it's one of the better places i think um i've played with sauvignon blanc in many other areas of napa but um that area tends to be better i i like to play with it one of the things that we get to do and because of the um our abilities i do something like matt does i pick a little bit early for some of that natural acidity i like want to make sure that i get some specific flavor profiles from that part but i also then allow some to hang a little bit longer and then i also have six different clones so we have not only is that there a diversity of um where we're growing it and the two different vineyard properties but in that we also have some vineyard and hilly aspects and with the different clonal selection and one of them being the muscat clone the muskie clone which also you can pick a little bit earlier and have less of those uh maybe herbaceous characters that some people really like but um i try to lean away from oh i see it wow that's exciting so you really do have like a diversity of styles there just even the winery itself that's quite exciting yeah and now you know with that in mind now let's move on to the most widely planted white varietal in napa which is of course as you might already know it's uh chardonnay and you know for a lot of consumers even in asia when you talk to them about na pachadone people tend to describe american chardonnay as oaky and ripe or people you know drink a lot of the shovelies and they'll say oh yeah it's a little bit fat a little bit um oily and flaccid would you know for people who say things about that about napa chardonnay what's your response is that a generalization of navashadome uh i'll jump in as soon as i make so much chardonnay i'd say yeah i mean the quintessential california style is going to be richer than the chablis it's going to be higher in alcohol it's going to have riper flavors and with that uh that right flavor oak tends to go and so you know where you know probably in the the 90s there was definitely very very oaky styles as the napa valley has evolved over time over the last few decades it's all about balance of fruit and oak and how you integrate that into the wine so while it's a generalization about california as a whole i would say that if you look at modern wine making especially in the napa valley it's more about balancing that fruit intensity with that men balance and i'd say you know where certain parts are well the wines have become more oaky i'd say napa valleys probably become less oaky and more into balance that's good so it's nice to see there's an evolution of style in napa like you said you know 90s maybe that okie and riper style is preferred then how would you describe the current popular chardonnay style in napa well sarah you want to help me out well delicious and um wait like you mentioned the evolution right and then in today's market would you say there's a preferred style of chardonnay or an eu awards because you guys are all winemakers is there a style that you aspire to in chardonnay sure i'd say there's been a real shift towards balance of fruit and acid and if you can get them all in balance you know the wines are getting better and better understanding of how to use dope more judiciously better oak sourcing better vineyard practices there's been a real shift from growing chardonnay all over the napa valley to down to the southern end of the valley where we can get a more varietal intensity and better acid balance so it's definitely evolved over the last few decades and i'd say right now some of the greatest chardonnays in the world you could put you know napa valley chardonnay especially in the southern end of the valley up against those wines and it would i think you'd be hard-pressed to really pick the best from some of the the riper styles from other parts of the world and it's uh it's been you know i've worked all over the place and made chardonnay in many many countries and to see how napa valley especially has evolved its style has been really really fun to be part of [Music] yeah in terms of planting chardonnay in napa do you see um with the climate change do you see some changes in in terms of picking as well do you notice you know to pick fruit a little bit earlier to return the freshness in the fruit yeah i mean we've we are definitely picking um you know earlier is really the right characteristic definitely picking more on acid balance rather than pure sugar like you probably would have seen two decades ago um to try and you know find that perfect sweet spot between like acid and fruit and you know there's a i mean there's a big generational transition young sarah's really young i'm really young and we're sort of like this new breed of napa valley winemaker that have come through not too very young we've got a different perspective and so it's all about making wines that not only appeal like to our u.s customers but our global customers and we're in the world and making a style that appeals to you know custer customers globally but still shows california at its best is the key and you know we can't make a white burgundy in napa valley but they can't make a napa valley's chard name like in burgundy and so we have to i think that's really the key of what what we're doing now as a community of winemakers is making a style that is california at its core that has global appeal and it's based on that right fruit intensity that we can we can get and balancing that with oak and acid and all the other components are able to work with that i'd say it's across the board with all the wines that you see coming out of the valley these days that's really exciting development and um as richie alluded to in his um you know a talk that's you know in the southern part of napa you see more exciting you know chardonnay coming up and in 2016 i noticed that uh pedro winery you purchased a vineyard in uh canaris uh maybe sarah you can tell us a little bit more what what motivated that move and um how has that you know veneer side affected the chardonnay that you're making okay sure so um what motivated the move well we were family owned and so the pg family decided to purchase another piece of property we purchased the old acacia facility and um and the vineyards surrounding it so really i have chardonnay growing at the very most furthest tip of the northern part of the napa valley where it's much warmer all the way down to the coolest part in the carneros region and you know there are distinct flavor characteristics that you're going to get be getting from either place one of the things that i would just throw in there really quickly is that chardonnay probably out of all the different varietals in my opinion at least and you guys can chime in is that you really have it's more of an a blank canvas and so we really can go in and kind of shift and change the flavor profiles based on picking decisions uh how much fruit we're leaving on the vine a lot of this stuff can you know we can do a lot in the vineyard to help kind of shift and guide the direction that we want to move the chardonnay into and then we can also have stuff that we can do in the vineyard in the cellar so there's a lot of um things that we can do to chardonnay that really you know it doesn't have like a distinct flavor profile like a like a sauvignon blanc does where it's real specific chardonnay is um kind of like i think it's a blank canvas and so it's a winemaker's wine if you will also a sense of place so that we are very fortunate here that we have really wonderful weather and that we can um we have a pretty diverse ability to kind of move it into all these different directions for carneros i mean i love that it's just it's really it's cool it's right you know our vineyard is right on the um near the bay so the san pablo bay you're on clear days we can see san francisco on clear days like you know and it's it's beautiful and it's cool and we have a great fog influence and it's much much cooler which is really ideal for chardonnay so in a nutshell pretty great you know um as you said here shadow there i absolutely agree with you it's blank canvas and winemakers would have more of an imprint on the style of the wine and and then we'll talk about another fussy grape um pinot noir it's notoriously fickle and fussy and um and um you know as the movie sideways says you really have to coax the grape into you know like a refined and elegant wine so in terms of wine making how do you guys coax pinot noir into making like a great wine sarah you're the only one that makes pinot on a regular basis so i think you should answer that all right i'll stop talking at some point so pinots what's interesting um how do we coax it and so i'm gonna give you from my perspective um i have nine different clones down in our carneros property and it really to me has more to do with the different clones um than you know trying to push you know the pinot one direction or another and yes we can certainly do that to a certain degree but there is going to be some clones that are going to give you more elegant um refined delicate complex you know softer more feminine notes if you will and then there's definitely i have clones that are just bigger and more concentrated and just like naturally just want to be bigger and have more robust in the pinot then we can certainly if you can do clonal selections and do it by themselves you're going to have a certain like characteristic of that clone also depending on where you're growing it but then you can also it's fun blending is so delightful and a great thing to do there you're picking decisions of course play into that but when you can combine the different clones that you have access to then you can have just an additional layers of flavors and then on top of that of course the choices of you know how you're doing your punch downs and what you're doing in the in the cellar on top of your oak selection i mean i think it's really really important and i know that we don't have time to go into oak and and have that conversation but the choices that you you know what what coopers and what oak you're putting with your different pinots and again it's not going to be the same one across the board is really um plays a big influence on your grape you know your overall quality of the wine and and going back to balance yeah yeah so can you give some example because you said you know there are ones that's a little bit uh dedicated the clones are a little bit dedicated floral their ones a little bit bigger so what are the ones that's a little bit dedicated for what are the ones that's bigger and how do you handle it in winemaking process okay so um i'm gonna go i'm gonna start with how do i handle it and i'm a bordeaux wine maker this will be my 20th harvest no i'm sorry my 30th harvest coming up 30 years making wine and you know there's i've been primarily making bordeauxs for like most of it so you're coming after you know someone coming in to make pinots um who might be a little heavy-handed if you will i try to push the pinots maybe more than someone who is like you know more burgundy in style however with that said um our primary clone for example tends to be just much more elegant softer tannins lower lower phenolic overall um the color is even just lighter in general and everything's everything's picked you know at night everything's hand-picked we you know we're sorting through um we have tiny little you know tanks that are open tops that we do very gentle punch downs but we've also done pump overs um and then with i mean like uh we have a 667 clone who that is probably those are my two extremes perhaps in our own vineyard and a 667 it's just you know it wants to be big it's basically looking at its you know the wine fermenting next door that's a cab and going like hey i want to be something more like that it has a chance at once it has a little bit more tannin structure it's got more color it's um but it has all those really beautiful components that you will find in a pinot noir and um so i think if you you know like one might be you know like depending on the type of pinot again no there's not going to be just napa style it's going to be you know there's just all these different um ways we can kind of like coax our wines into different directions so if you like you know a lighter more elegant style of pinot we've got that right but if you want it to be something bigger and more robust and have some oomph to it we also have that and i would say that is you know with whether we're talking about pino or other varietals here in the napa valley that's what's so like wonderful about it is that we have so many different you know vineyards and personalities and i love that richie said that i was young thank you but we really do have all this whole like range of um what we can you know what we can do in the vineyards and what we can do in the sellers and i think we're all doing a pretty good job yeah i think it's really wonderful because you're making different styles and you give consumers you know a wealth of choices as well if someone likes a lighter style they can go for one particular wine and if they do like a riper style they can go for something else and uh yeah it's really good richie for instance you once again like uh in your past life you have experiences of making you know in different regions you know napa of course being the most known new world wine region how would you compare like a napa style to perhaps a pinot from australia pinot from new zealand hockey spay yeah um i mean like in australia there's been a big push with pinot noir in like the south eastern corner of australia especially tasmania and being further south it's going to be a lot cooler and they're definitely going for a more burgundian style and i would say new zealand i mean obviously it's a much cooler place and so the wines inherently are going to be um have higher acid lower alcohols have a little more finesse and i don't want to say like nappa's low in acid because it's definitely not and as sarah said it really comes down to clones and why making how far you want to push it and they have you know we have the same clones we have in southeastern australia and new zealand we have them in napa but it's very much napa is definitely going to have a riper expression and the really the best sites uh especially down the southern the valley around camaris you know some great world-class pinot noir growers i mean there's a lot of a couple of very famous investors from france from burgundy who have bought land in in carnaris and have partnerships and that's exactly definitely a riper style but it's it's a world-class style and it's distinctively napa in my opinion but it's still what i love about it is it still tastes like pineapple it's not so ripe that it becomes generic red wine it still has varietal intensity it still has acid it still has balance but it's unmistakably uh napa valley and that's what i love about it when i've done these tastings in other parts of world where i bring wines from napa uh back to new zealand or back to australia they stand out they stand out because they're very very high quality and they're rich and they're full but they still taste like pinot and that's really i think the best thing about them yeah definitely you can't mistake pinot with other great varieties there's just uh you know um that's very distinctive uh but matt you i know you focus more on bordeaux varietals in your past life and that you know brand napa as well but in your previous life in argentina and south africa do you have experiences with pinot noir and in terms of winemaking did you observe some differences in terms of what they're doing in the cellar and napa valley yeah so i didn't do any pinot noir in argentina or south africa i was able to try some uh pinot noir from the hermanas bay area in south africa which is a really nice cool climate and it was well suited to the variety so they had some some interesting you know clean you know more burgundian style um pinots there um going back a little farther um most of my experience with pinot noir is in uh edna valley kind of nearby san luis obispo on the central coast of california um so i was there in 2009 um doing quite a bit of pinot noir from that region um and you know like sarah i'm kind of a bordeaux variety guy and so i actually did my my thesis on um improving or increasing color in pinot noir um and so you know beyond what we're doing in the winery there's things um like early and more extreme sun exposure in the vineyards um to help those grapes load a little bit more color um whether you want that or not uh into into your fruit and so um you know that's kind of an additional tool we have in the vineyard as far as what we were doing at the winery at that time and what i see a lot of is um open top fermenters so um when you're seeing those cylindrical tanks that have no no talk to them basically um and that's really popular with pinot um i think largely for heat dissipation you know pinot being a fickle grape you don't want to let those temperatures go out of control especially if you're trying to make a more reserved style so those open top tanks allow you to to make sure you're not building up a huge heat mask in your tank um and dissipate that heat and alcohol and then another kind of unique tool to pinot noir at least in my experience was the inclusion of stems or doing a whole cluster fermentations on pinot noir so i don't know sarah if you if you've played with that at all but um from my understanding it's largely um to help again color stability uh bringing some tannin in from those stems um you know hopefully you're getting more brown stems rather than green stems so you're not getting the green flavors um but you're you're helping with the uh what we call co-pigment co-pigmentation um which helps with your your color stability on that um on the piano and probably add some of that kind of fun pinot funk charm as well um i see it quite interesting to see all those things they do in other different wineries um yeah great that's pinot and now let's move to a more controversial should i say red grape varietal which is merlot um you know myrtle got a lot of a bad rap from the movie sideways but you know that was how many years ago more close to two decades ago do you see a change of consumers perception in merlot or do you still feel the stings of sideways i i'll jump in i would say um from an american perspective there's definitely there was a a steady decline in merlot but what i honestly believe there's been a huge positive about that and really the popularity merlot was its greatest downfall and so molo was planted in regions or areas in the napa valley which weren't ideally suited you have to remember that merlot uh suffers greatly from hydraulic stress or heat stress it's not like cabinet where you can plant almost any and produce a world-class wine and it likes clay soils and if you look at a lot of the soils on the napa valley floor on the hillsides you have a lot of alluvial soils if you come to the southern end of the napa valley which is a little bit cooler there's more clay soils that's where merlot thrives and so there's been taking out merlot in sights in the napa valley which really aren't suited to really focusing on where merlot does well and what the benefit of that has been we now have better merlot than we've ever had before we understand now that you know it suffers greatly if it's overcropped it like maybe crop a little too high and get away of it but if you have a crop merlot it's it's really not gonna do well and i feel like that that false sense of uh sideways has given us this impetus to make merlot better than it's ever been before and so the merlots are still produced in napa there's only a handful of us still doing that i know sarah still makes one right sarah please not better now than they were two decades ago because we're really focused in on now sourcing fruit from the best sites that are suited to merlot and not planting an alongside cabernet it just doesn't grow the same it doesn't like the same soils really good i think you know and made wine makers as you said it made winemakers to be more precise in terms of why making site selection to make wines and definitely more focused i think that's really good um and you know sarah i think you make a merlot at your winery so how does it how how can you describe the style of the myrtle that you're making i sure can so i make a merlot that i sometimes do 100 merlot i actually make several different blends of with merlot in them and i would say just speaking to the overall popularity of merlot people like merlot maybe they've been drinking it as a red blend but they've been drinking merlot and people enjoy merlot it's um it's fleshy it's it has it's more approachable than sometimes a cab can be a little bit lower tannins armor low tends to be big it's just naturally got some more oomph to it and i think sometimes that surprises people and when we're at pouring events and people go oh i don't want to try merlot i actually really enjoy giving them a splash because a lot of times people think it's cab not that we're trying to make it a cabernet but the flavor profile it's got it's it's definitely um a bigger um it can be a bigger wine than a lot of people i think just anticipate we're like back you know back or gone are the days where uh merlot was that soft fleshy not very you know um voluptuous wine where merlot can also be big and and have a lot of weight to it and so we do some of our most popular wines at the winery are mermelow based and so it's very popular and i'm a i'm a pro merlot consumer i see that's very good you know like um you know if i compare pinot noir and myrtle because you barely see pinot in the blend but merlot you see more of it you know blending with different uh you know chardonnay cabernet or you know petite dough to make a blend or sometimes people make 100 um merlot wine so in terms of uh you know diversity style of myrtle in napa uh what's the trend here do you see people using more merlot in the blend or making 100 single variety one i guess i'll jump in really um so i think i mean that's hard to say like real specific to everyone in napa but i would say in general i think you're gonna see more merlot being blended with something else something is either you know a portion of the merlot whether it's even just a five percent or a ten percent added to the merlot or merlot is part of a cabernet blend um merlot tends to be less expensive um but it can be you know it's just it's delicious and so you're gonna to see diversity there where people are blending their merlot and you can again it goes back to i guess the take-home message is going to be that there's so much diversity and there's so many different options here in the napa valley that you're going to if you want 100 merlot you're going to be able to find it if you want to you know if you want to find it and see it in different blends you're also going to see that there i mean that's it just it grows well here um as does a lot of varietals so that's really good okay now let's jump into the most important uh great varietal in napa cabernet sauvignon you know people know napa because of cab and you know cab i think it found really spiritual home in napa valley so how would you describe cab and why is this so successful in napa valley i'll leave that to everyone that's a that's a broad question i would say that honestly if you look at napa valley it has that perfect balance of of soil well-drained soils that cabernet likes and climate and so it's warm enough to ripen cabernet to a ripe expression but there's also enough diversity in the site selection to give you a style of many different styles and so it has international appeal and if you looked at i mean if you the joke i always have about cabinets it's the ultimate traveler you can plant it almost anywhere in the world and do well but to really do it at a world-class level where it's better than anything else there's very few places that you can do it and napa valley because of the climate because of those cool nights and warm days the well-drained soils the diversity of soils the diversity of aspects you just it's it really is just a home run no matter how you look at it i see and then in napa valley it's uh you know sarah probably said you know cabernet you can basically plant it anywhere but so far the world quality calves where are the best sites where are they coming from your wineries of course but i'll jump in i i think we have a really special site where we're at um i love cabernet from from the entire napa valley um but we're in this um terrific little bubble um in an area called pritchard hill in the napa valley which is kind of just uphill to the east from um from oakville and so we're on um these really uh beautiful volcanic soils primarily um again with the diversity uh we have four different soil series on our about 11 and a half acres of vines here and we're really lucky to be on a site um that has those rocky soils that are very well drained so you know as winemakers um and growers we're kind of control freaks so um you know we control the the water status of our plants um which is a huge benefit um we're also at at a higher elevation um we're up at about 1400 feet so we're we're often above the fog lines so we're getting early morning sun exposure um and you know our specific location um gets a really nice breeze that comes up the valley uh and so we're typically between the elevation and the breeze about five degrees cooler than valley floor so um you know what what results for us is small berries with lots of concentration um i think you know going back to the bigger picture napa wide um you know i think a key component of napa cab is is purity of fruit um but i think something that's special about napa cab is that you have that purity of fruit with a lot of the nuance that you see in the old world as well so um you find you know some minerality some earthiness um some sage especially where we're located um and you find all these things without overly green wines and so it's it's this beautiful dichotomy of you know power tanning um purity of fruit but also a really amazing amount of nuance in the wines let's see i think i have one question for all the panelists because the cabernet you know it's the white most widely planted varietal worldwide and every winemaker is trying their hand you know a cabernet so when you so in a way it's very competitive and if a consumer looking at a wine shelf you see cab from australia from argentina from chile even from china and so for consumers if they are choosing a cabinet and if they're deciding to choose it from california napa valley what are the top lines what are the adjectives you want the consumers to remember about cap from now i guess i'll jump in because sarah doesn't want to jump i would say like if you looked at like napa cabernet as a as a global wine and you compared it to the other great cabernet regions of the world you know anywhere in the world actually i would say that the hallmark of cabernet is is concentration depth of flavor and its tannen's structure and napa valley cabernet has this wonderful tenon structure where you have an immense amount of tannin yet they're ripe towns and there's very places in the world that can do that like the napa valley you know you might get the odd site here and there in other parts of the world and i mean a single site but if you look at the napa valley as a whole our ability to make wines with depth concentration loads of tannin that's still ripe so the wine is in balance it's not hard there's no rough edges to it it's something that you really can't do anywhere else in the world and it's really like when you put a napa valley cabinet in a lineup it stands out for its it's depth of concentration yeah yeah definitely i think one thing that struck me is the balance as well because a lot of times people talk about cab in napa if you think oh you know it's too heady but when i was visiting napa like the wines that we tasted you really find they're really balanced and refined i think it has to do with the evolution of winemaking as well people understand you know which side produces what kind of style cabinet very precise in terms of winemaking selection as well last few decades as well you know i think there's been a huge drive in the napa valley to balance and gone are the days of the super high octane high alcohol wines and it's all about balancing fruit and alcohol and there's one thing we could do in napa which a lot of other places can't do in the world is because of that sheer depth of concentration we can cap a bit higher alcohol but the wine is still in balance whereas if you did a cooler region and you let the fruit get that ripe the alcohol is going to overpower the wine it's going to thin the wine out and make it seem hot and hollow but because of that sheer depth of fruit concentration we carry napa we can make wines that have depth weight concentration yet remain balanced and that's what's really key to napa valley on a global scale compared to other wine regions in the world is that depth of flavor yet balanced and there's very few places that i've worked anywhere or travel in the world that can do that let me see yeah that's really precious but what about sarah you make uh your cabernet from different parts and you make cabernet from you know sort of like the crown jewel as well from rutherford um so maybe you can tell us a little bit more about the style of cab that you're working with at the winery sure so we have um so we have six different vineyard properties in napa and we have cabernet sauvignon planted in five and in those five different vineyards i have 11 different clones of cabernet so it really we have you know cab planted in various locations and i think it's been really interesting over the course of you know since i've been in the wine industry how much we've learned as an industry in napa and i'm going to do a quick little shout out for the nvv for the napa valley vietnamese for doing a lot of education for getting wine makers together to talk one of the really wonderful things about being in napa is that we you know we do have we communicate and we get together with our winemaking you know colleagues and we share information and instead of going you know thinking that we're like their little private things and and to keep them by ourselves we um we're like hey what are you doing like what's working for you the one thing is that it's all going to be a little bit different simply because we have our different wine making styles if we were to give chefs all chicken and the same ingredients they're likely going to come up with something very different right so we still have that ability our unique um terwar our you know our i can even in our vineyard i'm sitting in rutherford right now and you know the the cab tastes different on one you know i'm the more um either the northern part or over on the west side versus the eastern side even in our own vineyards you're gonna have different flavor profiles and different soil types and then you throw the clones on there and then add oak on top of that and how that all plays in um i mean i'm speaking more than to the bigger it's i guess i make a lot of cabs and um they're all i kind of like but they all have to be unique so i will do either site specific vineyard designated or combinations of all and like i do have you know make fruit from rutherford and um you know rutherford just specifically just to do a shout out i mean it's you know this great you know there's really unique flavor profiles for just this appellation specifically but that's what we can say that is because we're talking now but you know picture trail has their own uniqueness you know every different parts of the valley really do have kind of like these really special characteristics that um actually cannot be duplicated or rarely can be duplicated duplicated um so if you want you know a lighter style of cab or you like something that has more herbaceousness maybe it's more savory herbs or but you can you can find that as well if you want something that is you know maybe a little over concentrated in balance but i would say most people i believe at least today are really truly making balance wines that really fit their specific style we're not trying anymore trying to like um make what the neighbor's making or what someone in another region is making we're just really trying to do the very best we can with the fruit that we have and we've learned an awful lot and we're continuing to learn and which is why everyone's on here and we're you know we're talking about it if we can educate and get people to understand um you know our region and what we have to offer um i think people are gonna be very happy and if you know that that style and that flavor profile that you like it's likely that you're going to find it here albeit we you know probably do have riper flavors in other parts just simply because we can and instead of fighting it um we just embrace it and we're you know and i would say the take home would be balanced wines across the board okay well definitely um the evolution of cab style in napa is quite prominent i hope you know more people recognize that change as well and another thing i think you mentioned you know it's the community spirit that's something that's you know i take away from my visiting napa as well when you're different wineries you're breaking bread with different wine makers you know what do you do with a cab i'm having issue with the you know early ripeness of cap and people are very eager and generous with their you know suggestions advice and expertise i think that's something a lot of the different wine regions should learn from napa as well quite precious yeah and then what about matt because you're you're making wine from one of the uh most uh sought after maybe uh expensive real estate in napa as well in pritchett hill and um pre your previous life is with uh donna estate as well so maybe you can tell us a little bit more about the area that you're making wines and the style of wines you're making with cap yeah so we're i mean like sarah i'm really trying to express the sight here being in a state winery um you know i'm extremely fortunate to be able to arrive at any one of our vines on the property and you know about 45 seconds on my atv um and so you know our approach here is is kind of to um obsess about everything uh and that obviously starts in the vineyard and quite honestly so much of the work happens in the vineyard um and so you know every step in the process uh we're obsessing about every detail um that doesn't always mean we're doing something um you know sometimes hands off is is the best uh way to go whether that's using you know the ambient or native yeast that are on the grapes and in our environment um whether it's deciding not to pick um it's it's it's uh making sure that you're never becoming complacent i think uh and giving the the specialness of the site the the respect it deserves so um again you know obsessive farming um you know i mentioned earlier we're kind of control freaks but at the same time as winemakers we build layers and layers and layers of complexity on everything we do um you know on our little site here we have 16 different blocks um and 13 different unique combinations of clone and variety so that makes for so much complexity it makes us pull our hairs out as you can see you know richie and i are struggling there a little bit um but it creates um just layers and layers and layers for us to work with you know we might have a one acre block here that i pick three different times um and that might be based on the aspect of the block how it rolls over the hill um you know maybe one of the different soil series i was mentioning creeps into a part of the block and so um you know here at brand it's it's um a focus on quality and i would say the same thing with napa valley i mean you can make all sorts of comparisons to other regions but i think what's special about napa valley is if that's on the label you know that somebody um obsessed about what went into that bottle i see that's very good i think we have some questions from the the audience one of the questions they asked is um how would you distinguish a rutherford from oakville caps yeah and then also you mentioned your napa because so wide and so diverse how would you distinguish one cap from for instance stacksby from whole well mountain and rutherford and oakville um that's a very challenging question but um i mean each each aba has a typicity to it if or um a characteristic to it um as a whole but even within that region or that that aba you know rutherford's famous for the rather for dust and it's dusty tannins and oakville to me is always pure cassis with a firm tannin structure but even within that region you can find wines that don't fit that meld but if you were to say where matt is on pritchard hill you know it's volcanic soils it's quite like you have an ambi or an abundance of tannin and more of a red fruit profile up on preacher hill calistoga they have ripe tannin but it can be a little bit hard sometimes over on the other side you have sedimentary soils up in mount veda and spring mountain they tend to be cooler get more black fruits more seeds sometimes a little bit leafy i mean each region has its typicity but they they definitely can change due to site clone farming practice i mean matt spoke about the the change within his small vineyard with their 13 and each block i'm guessing has a very distinct character which is very distinct but if you put them all together they're going to taste like a pritchett hill cabernet and brand makes an amazing cabinet and i know sarah makes multiple cabernets throughout the napa valley and i'm sure they all have their the unique flavors based region but it's it's i mean there's definitely ones out there that are very specific to that ava but there's also ones that will stand out because they're a little bit different within the aba which is the beauty of napo if it's many what do we have a hundred and conor can probably jump in a hundred and something different soil types so it's uh it's pretty diverse [Music] i see okay um anyone else who want to add on this miss sarah or matt i think richie did a really great job i mean truly they yeah wrapped it up did a nice job great i think um there's another question about organic um you know wine making and um farming in napa valley so what is a what is the status uh what's people's attitude with the organic organic wine and what is the trend do you see winemakers heading towards that direction i guess i'll jump in quickly there's a big business towards sustainability in napa um most wineries i i know most of my friends uh certified napa valley green so they're they have a sustainable certification and beyond that you have the next step of organic and there's a lot of organic producers and really at the the top end you have the biodynamic and generative farming which is sort of the further extreme i would say that to look at any winery in the napa valley the goal is to preserve what they have and make it better so we don't want to continually take from the land we want to put back so there's definitely a trend towards organic principles biodynamic principles maybe not everyone is certified but we all want to preserve that that land that we have and make sure it's there for the future so it's something that say is gaining ground it's gaining ground very quickly even if people are not certified i know we use a number of different biodynamic and organic principles in our vineyards um it's really it's it's the future i mean let's face it we have to look after the land that we have and make sure that it's there for future generations and if you're i've never seen any winemaker who cares about his vineyard who's not gonna farm it in a sustainable way to make sure it's there for the future yeah indeed i would just jump in really quickly to say just for clarity we're talking about more sustainability and organic farming in the vineyard rather than making organic wines in the in the in the cellar and you know for someone like we're we're certified organic here in rutherford we're sustainable you know i think it is the trend in the napa valley and i think it's because we really do care about the land that we you know people are um across the board whether it's in the vineyard or the wineries themselves becoming green becoming sustainable across the board it's just kind of our it's just you know one of the things that we just do here and people are doing it you know really really well but i just wanted to make sure that we're clarifying that you know it's more vineyard practices as opposed to the seller at least here in napa we with csc oh that's very good i think we had a wonderful discussion today about the you know the six memberitos in napa and i hope all the audience who tuned in to watch our talk would uh walk away with their impressions of the different varieties and they're armed with a wealth of knowledge to help sell napa wines to their customers from different countries and different parts of the world so thank you so much for joining us tonight um they have another discussion coming up tomorrow and thursday at 8 a.m pacific time so definitely tune in as well and thank you for all the panelists for your time and expertise and have a lovely day everyone", "OcfNmhQxc9Y": "hello friends it's karina from eight vape welcome back to our channel today we are doing another taste test video with cloud nerds this is scraped strawberry strawberry grape grape something open it fill it vape it thanks for the instructions cloud nerds would have never known so strawberry grape i'm guessing it's gonna be strawberry and grape uh let's see if that's what this tastes like definitely tastes like really sugary very very sweet like if you are into like high intensity um like like the power of just like nerds like nerds candy then this will be the one for you it has a really strong um strawberry flavor the grape is a little bit on the subtle side but um overall the flavors do really go well together it's kind of like a pixie stick kind of like nerds it's very very candified so if that's what you're into then you're going to be very pleased with this one hmm would this be a great all day vape i don't know i can already kind of feel like i'm getting a little dehydrated um just because it's so sweet but uh i could definitely see this if you're like a salt nick user if you get this in a salt and put it in a little portable device and take it with you on the go then i think that's the perfect way to experience this because a full tank of this will probably wear you out a little bit it's very intense very in your face so yeah i would recommend it for lighter usage um on the go type stuff or just you know the one that you keep you like in your purse or your car you know one of those things for like your backup i don't know if it would be like my go-to every day unless you're super into like a lot of sugary sweetness and i know a lot of people out there are i used to be more on the extreme sweet side but now i'm finding myself just like have little hints of um sweetness added to certain flavors um yeah yeah i'm more into like fruits and stuff less into the candies these days but if some of you are like fully in the candy zone whatever you want to call it um definitely worth picking this one up cloud nerds grape strawberry i'm gonna give you a seven because you do taste good but you taste almost a little too good and that

everything we're going to need is some Jolly Ranchers sugar some strawberry extract Caro syrup some grapes a measuring cup and some toothpicks and I'm just starting off by pouring two cups of sugar so we're gonna add in half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the karo syrup you want to make sure everything is thoroughly combined and then you're gonna set the temperature to medium heat then I'm just washing off my grapes with cold water and the sink nothing specific I'm doing here just letting water run over all of them and you just want to make sure that they're thoroughly dry after and I just use a napkin to Pat them dry and here's how I insert the toothpick inside the grape I basically insert it on the side that doesn't have that little hole at the top because it makes it easier and more sturdy whenever we're dipping it into the syrup in here I'm just using my magic bullet to grind up two Jolly Ranchers because I wanted to have a kind of like powdery consistency [Music] [Music] and hey I'm just taking a cup of cold water and pouring a little bit of syrup in it if when you fill the liquid and it's hard that means it's ready and if it still feels like a soft ball that just means it needs to cook a little longer in here I'm just adding in the strawberry extract I didn't put a specific amount I just put like a dash of it in there and stirred it up and you can use any specific flavor you like I just want it to taste some strawberry [Music] okay I first start off by having my parchment paper on the counter I just laid it out flat just gonna grab the great fighter toothpick and dip it in the syrup I kind of hurt my pop tipsy to the side then you're gonna place it in the cup or play with your Jolly Rancher mix and just kind of scoop it on to the grape in the same steps apply if you don't want a Jolly Rancher mix on it you're just going to dip it into the syrup and then just place it gently on the parchment paper and this is how the grapes came out guys and they were so good leave a comment below if you guys decide to make these and things for watching [Music]", "ReMnF8TwW9A": "my name is Owen rounds from Grouse brothers or uncle Andrus ten years ago we decided to start brewing some organic stuff and we're putting about 50 acres each year into organic we have the seven acres of grapes and we have in addition to that the 200 acres of farmland for vegetables and then we have 65 acres of blueberries that are certified organic it's been a good experience we really enjoy it we like growing and organically it's a challenge but you know it's fun these Fresh Market varieties are a lot bigger and sweeter than aids on really good scans a lot more tender you pump the whole thing in your mouth is needed so when will you start seeing fruit where you can see the [Music] like the great how old are these five these now are six years over as far as fruit goes you get to harvest off of them for many weeks and if they go all the way to cross yeah

reviewing a really exotic Wildomar cannabis that I've been enjoying lately this is the grape jelly donut and this stuff has a crazy cross it really is just some amazing cannabis so let's start kick off the episode by taking a nice grip of the grape jelly doughnut I broke out in the vaporizer for this episode just to switch it up a little bit I've been doing you know flower smoking and then all the episodes so I decided to break out the bait this is a vapor brothers vaporizer just a standard $160 box fake that actually worked really really well great flavor nice size clouds and the high is just almost unbeatable so like I said let's take a nice grip of this grape jelly donut get medicated and taste this cannabis cheers guys mmm oh wow that is tasty oh my gosh so let's start off I guess with the genetics of this strain so this is the grape jelly doughnut it was grown by a grower who goes by Vicky's 420 on Instagram he grows a lot of cannabis for North Star I think holistic collective in Sacramento and he's knowledge some of his cannabis is available at an urban farm and in San Francisco as well and this stuff is crazy if the cross is birthday cake oh gee crosstube grape sugar and to break that down the birthday cake oh gee is a white fire oh gee some I think it's one of the phenotypes like a number three or something I can't remember cross two cookies I think and then that's the birthday cake oh gee and then the grape sherbert is a GDP cross to a sherbert at sunset sure but I believe and then say you crossed the great river to the birthday cake oh gee and you get great jelly doughnuts so a lot of crazy names going on there but they really describe the flavor and smell and it truly is a crazy cross I mean you got cooking sherbert you know OG GDP it's it's really a powerhouse you know lot of powerhouse trains coming together so this stuff is exotic for sure but as usual let's start off with the smell of this cultivar because this stuff whoa smells incredible guys it's got a very very loud sort of sweet musky woody dough aroma that actually does have a lot of like earthiness in it as well very sweet earthiness but it's just this musky doughy sweet wood eNOS that is so so exotic I mean he just almost smell every strain you can definitely smell the cookies that's one of the most dominant aromas in there and I'm guessing the sugar you know plays with in with that fuel Edo eNOS seems like the og might give it some of that earthiness and the the GDP definitely would have given some that sweetness but it is just an incredibly intoxicating smell I mean it's like a twist on cookies a crazy twist really has that cookie dough we bunk in the background but you know this really sweet musky wood eNOS that is predominant as well since I got the vape out for this episode let's let's assess the flavor next because this thing really provides excellent excellent flavor with flowers all right cheers guys oh my god silky smooth Wow and the flavor is very similar to the smell it has a strong strong cookie dough eNOS in the background for sure really really coats your entire mouth I mean I can just taste it strong really that muskiness and it has that sweet earth as well really really strong flavor I forgot to say again I think the smell for this one is just enhanced hands-down 10 out of 10 for me I love the smell and the flavor I mean it really has to be a 10 out of 10 as well cheers guys and the looks of this stuff is just insane as well I mean I I'm a huge cookie fan it's probably one of my favorite strains and any cookie varieties or cooking process I'm always you know looking for them and this stuff is just crazy looking with the combination of parents come going into the strain you know it really has this beautiful cannabis beautiful colors amazing trichome coverage it's just totally exotic looking the nugs themselves are I would say a little bit like og a little bit like cookies they're you know tight tight calyxes for sure not as pronounced as OG but it sorta has an OG nug structure but in terms of the color there's just a crazy crazy darker purple color throughout I mean in the inside of these nuts are just completely that beautiful like gemstone amethyst purple that's what it is as an amethyst purple and it's just a crazy contrast between sort of the that you know true green contrast with this this amethyst purple that is just remarkable there's sparse pale copper pistols throughout the nug and the tricone coverage on this stuff is just beautiful I mean big large trichome heads they completely cover everything they gleam in the light and when you break this stuff open it's just that pure amethyst purple you know absolutely encrusted with trichomes just gorgeous it really has an incredible color I mean for it looks at once again it's just a 10 out of 10 all right now let's assess the high this strain and I can already tell you I'm definitely feeling the effects but I love this vape it really you know it's it's it's nice to take a break from combustion for sure with flowers the vape this thing gets you so high I mean it vaporizes all the terpenes all the cannabinoids it gets everything you know sometimes when you're combusting cannabis you're burning off some of the terpenes this stuff just vaporizes it and you can feel the effects the terpenes you know working with the cannabinoids the entourage effect you can really feel all the effects of the constituents in your medicine and this I love this fake it's it's really a nice way of medicating so let's take another draw here and assess the high of this stuff all right cheers guys Wow the highness tough guys is so nice it's very very strong cannabis it really has a potent indica stone for sure you know three of the actually all the parents sorry all the parents are just pretty much indicas cookies oh geez sherbert and GE P are all just heavy indica so you put them all together and you get a crazy high very very relaxing effects definitely dropped your eyelids big-time I mean it's got me my muscles in my body just feeling so warm and good then I really recommend this cannabis for you know afternoon use to evening use tonight use because it's very very relaxing very sedated produces a very happy indica stone that's gonna leave you very relaxed feeling good uplifted mood and just really really chilled out mmm tastes amazing well I hope you guys liked this review of the grape jelly doughnut I'm really diggin this strain it's definitely making its way up into my favourites but yeah if you please stay

for watching and stay Stoney peace guys", "WB1L4ZQ7Qss": "[Music] what else we gain it's your girl Rochelle in the building and today I'm coming to bring you another great video in this video I'm going to show you how to create infuse crack grapes if you are new to my channel hit that subscribe button that notification bail and leave a comment in the comment section below letting me know how you enjoyed this video here I have my grapes you're gonna need a half cup of water a half cup of light corn serve 2 cups a granulated sugar full coloring of your choice some flavoring to go into your mixture this is a lime flavor to go along with the Absolut lime liqueur right into your mixture you're gonna need some sticks for your grapes and you can't forget the Jolly Ranchers you're gonna need some paper towel along with a candy thermometer a food processor or blender to blend your Jolly Ranchers now let's get into the video here I have my grapes into a bowl you want to soak your grapes and too with the liquor you can use a shot or two shots long as you soak your grapes and once you do that make sure you cover them up and taking some gloves and you just want to swivel and swish around your grapes into that liquor so that it can be completely coated and then put away to sit for two to three hours alright now you're going to take our grapes and make sure you dry them completely they need to be completely dry and you can insert your sticks right into your grapes and let them sit out until your mixture is complete [Music] you want to make sure you use long sticks so that you'll be able to dip them into your mixture and not have your fingers burnt off so make sure your sticks are long you guys so you don't have any burns on your fingertips that's important so here we have our Jolly Ranchers you want to unwrap them and make sure that your Jolly Ranchers stay dry and not wet it will be difficult to blend your Jolly Ranchers into your blender if they are wet so I'm using between 30 to 36 of these Jolly Ranchers and they're going to go right into my little food processor that I have here which you can find on Amazon a great fine and great for these Jolly Ranchers so we're going to go ahead and take our top off and put our Jolly Ranchers right into the blender here now we're going to put our top on and you want to do a few pulsating spins with these Jolly Ranchers and get to mixing them up so they can break down evenly [Music] now we got to remove our top and check out our mix here now see here you have your Jolly Ranchers they're a little bit thick and a little bit large in size but you don't want that you want to break them down to a much finer crumble so that they'll be able to coach your golly rant of crack grapes your grapes evenly all right so here we have the crumble of your candy mixture or Jolly Ranchers not mixture and this is the end result of how you want your Jolly Ranchers to turn out to be now let's make our mixture let's add our 1/2 cup of water our 1/2 cup a light corn syrup [Music] now we're going to add our two cups of granulated sugar and we got a mix and combine this well this particular recipe will it cover at least fifty to sixty grapes so we're going to insert our candy thermometer make sure you clip it on the side don't let it touch the bottom of the pot or it will give off a false reading you guys so make sure that you just insert your candy thermometer right into the mixture so that you can get and receive a good reading as your mixture cook you want to then add in your liqueur and add in your flavor you want to let this cook to 280 to 80 degrees and you want to add in about two tablespoons of your liquor being that you're adding in this liquid you want to let your mixture cook and remove at 300 degrees now I'm adding in the flavor and you want to add in the full dram to this recipe okay once that has cooked to 300 degrees remove your thermometer and you want to place it in a cup so that you can get that candy mixture off of there and now we're going to add our color add in four drops of white gel food coloring and you want to mix that in adding in the white will help give you a lighter tone color so the color I'm trying to achieve is a teal color with using this sky blue I want to add in three to four drops of the blue to create the light teal color that I'm looking for and you want to mix that very well until all of the gel food colour is equally combined [Music] now here we have our teal color the color I was looking for taking your grape and dipping it right in scraping off a little bit and add it right into your jolly mix your Jolly Rancher mix and dip and add it right to your jolly mixture dip I like to cover my grape I like to coat it fully or you can cover halfway it's totally up to you whatever you prefer but make sure that is coated well and then you can dip right into your Jolly Rancher mix now once your mix is in the bowl if it sits a little while and it gets hard just break it up either with a spoon or run your hand through it or you can put it back into your mixer and break it up just a little bit so that it can break up that hard hardness as it sits and there you have you guys are infused crack or candied grapes if you have enjoyed this video give this video a thumbs up leave a comment in the comment section below letting me know how you enjoyed this

this is my Escalade you super upset with me right now he just wants to go to the park park all right this is about ESCO my two-year-old 35 pound boy french bulldog all right ESCO being a young boy decided to get into my groceries yesterday I was sitting in the car waiting to go inside and I heard something so I checked in the back seat and ESCO got into my grocery bag my Whole Foods bag and I had grapes well he decided to eat grapes I nearly died I freaked out and was panicking well ESCO ate about 20 to 30 grapes mind you he's only 35 pounds which is pretty small within the first 10 minutes as soon as I found out I rushed inside my house my good friend who's a vet was really close by so I called her and asked what I should do she had told me well let's go back I knew that I had to get on it ASAP because you don't want them to digest in their body so within the first 10 minutes I handled it quickly luckily I was right outside my house and I could come inside and I can figure this out so I called my friend and I said hey this will happen she works at a hospital a pet hospital and she told me okay this is what you should do well I had everything that I should do so I gave ESCO hydrogen peroxide I gave him a little bit at first and nothing happened and I was like oh my god nothing's happening I'm freaking out he knew something was wrong he was sitting there like what did I do what's going on I'm freaking out I gave him a little bit more and by that time his mouth was salivating so he was like drooling and drooling and he looked uncomfortable and ah okay he's gonna throw up soon it took like maybe ten minutes for the hydrogen peroxide till I get into his stomach you know kind of digest and then he'd threw everything up The Grapes weren't even chewed ESCO has an underbite and he uses his tongue for everything he does really chew so I was thankful that the greatest didn't you know explode or you know release the toxins I don't know I'm guessing the inside of the the grape is where the toxins are out for dogs so I was doing some research on grapes and dogs grapes are highly toxic they can be very fatal depending on how much they eat luckily ESCO didn't get into a full bag of grapes who knows what would have happened the reason I didn't take him to emergency room was because I have really good people in my circle that can give me advice and help me through things so I called my close friend who is a vet I [Music] could results out of it and also I feed ESCO very clean I cook all of his food so I feel that that really helped his recover this the next morning he's fine actually after he threw up was like wanting to play with his ball and Mike had like full energy and he had to use the restroom maybe like two times last night but I feel that he wouldn't have bounced back as quick if I didn't give him clean too that's just my opinion on and if the fruit digested in their stomach it could lead to kidney failure so I was really worried about that so I make sure he got lots of water and lots of liquids so he could flush out any toxins that did digestion and belly he did throw up the grapes in whole form it was gross he didn't throw up everything but this morning when I went to go pick up his poop he did have grapes in his poop they again were in hole form but I knew that his body was pushing out the toxins so I do feel that feeding him healthy really helped him push it out quicker and today he's normal you know asking for attention wanting to go outside wanting to play has no you know ate a full meal this morning I fed him chicken carrots broccoli Brussels sprouts and sweet potato and then I give him the broth with a little bit of collagen so I do give a little supplement but no reaction doesn't seem down because energy is great and he's a healthy young boy but I'm just so thankful that I have good people around me I do know that hydrogen peroxide helps with inducing throw-up you literally threw up one time and he was good to go he was like all right I'm rejuvenated I'm ready to go he wants to go on our walk so we're gonna go for a walk so yeah if you have any questions about what I feed ESCO or if you have any questions about like how I gave him the hydrogen please ask anything this is just something I felt that people should know that like if their dog ever gets into something you can do you know something at home if you have people around you that are great with dogs you know ask them and get it advice if you don't feel comfortable and of course if you really don't feel comfortable please take your dog to the vet think that that knows everything yeah ESCO boy is great he's asking to go outside ESCO boy you won't go your park you will go park ok this go", "tHXwrViK0sA": "tell us how you eat a Concord

"[Music] hey guys today I want to make a video about the differences between wine grapes and table grapes so I've got a couple of both right here first one here is a Cabernet Sauvignon which is a pretty good representation of a wine grape what you see here would be a lot like what you'd see in a merlot a Malbec some of the bigger popular red wine varieties and then here I've got a table grape and these usually aren't labeled I think this might be a ruby seed list but it's really anybody's guess what this is so visually you'll obviously see there's some differences table grapes are almost always going to be a lot larger than wine grapes wine grapes are usually smaller they're more concentrated and you know if it's a red wine it's actually a lot darker than the table grape so it's like a blue-black instead of just like a you know cranberry colored skin the one thing you'll notice about wine grapes it's really obvious is that they have a really really thick skin so these are actually called a slip skin so I'm gonna squeeze it pop it out here and kind of let the pulp out and you can see the pulp here is green even though it's a red grape so all the skin you're gonna get from this is gonna come from that that or all the color you're gonna get from this is going to come from the skin so I don't know if I squeeze it really hard if I'll get any color here but normally you would or pretty much always you would ferment a red wine on the skins and let all that color kind of suck out of those blue black skins on that grape the seedless grape the table grape is pretty much exactly what you know as a kid eating there's a seed usually in there but it doesn't have the crunch like if I were to crunch on these wine grapes the seeds are pretty pretty intense they're pretty bitter they're pretty astringent where if I eat this grape I can't even really tell there's seeds in there I don't know if the Thompson seedless if there even is a seed there and that does bring a question well how do you grow a grape if it's seedless well pretty much all grape vines are propagated from grape vine cuttings so they're usually even referred to as a clone number so if you go up a whole row of grapes it's not only going to be the same grape variety it's gonna be genetically identical to every other grape in that row and that kind of keeps you know if you find a grape that vine that's really working well you don't have to worry about any weird cross-pollination that could happen on the future generations of that grape vine if you were propagating by seed the other big difference between these is you'll notice that the wine grapes are really really sweet the store-bought grapes are sweet they're usually 14 to 16 percent sugar but these red wine grapes are closer to 24 to 26 percent sugar usually so just a lot more sugar additionally they're gonna be a little bit higher acid and all that really helps to give you this big intense full-bodied wine with you know the acid the tannin all that sugar gets mostly converted to alcohol if this is gonna be a dry red wine so really just makes for a really good good wine I'm only talking about red grapes in this but the white grapes are gonna be the same you're still gonna have the slip skin you're gonna have high higher sugars higher acids generally white grapes are a little bit lower in sugar so instead of 24 to 26 percent you might be you know 19 to 23 percent sugar but all still the same family vidis vinifera would be the genus as vidis the strain to be or the species I guess would be Vanna Farah and then from there you have each strain so you know all your wine grapes so those are really the key differences between like I said slip skin big crunchy seeds higher acid higher sugar those are gonna be your biggest differences between a table grape and a wine grape and that's why you don't really see wine grapes sold for eating even well you could eat them but people probably just don't really want to chew on that big skin and they also don't want to crunch on those really bitter seeds so they're just not as you know maybe commercializable from an edible standpoint even though they taste delicious

the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "5QSuBn15taw": "hey what's up YouTube Enzo Tropper here with but super calm and in this video I'm gonna show you how to open the Korova Saturday morning cookie so one other thing that this offers is childproof packaging when I first got this I didn't really realize that it was childproof packaging and I was kind of ripping and tearing at it and getting frustrated because I couldn't quite open it you know and every time I would I would kind of just I would have to fight it but after a little bit of research I figured out that on the package here it has the instructions for the childproof packaging so there is a technique to opening these things and I'm gonna show you how to do that in the video so here's the packaging and it has a little tear tab on here you can see I've already open this up so you just basically just tear it peel this off once you get this open you look inside and you'll see okay it looks kind of like a normal ziplock bag and you kind of want to you know just open it thinking that that'll pull it but that's not really the case and then if you're trying to peel this apart you'll notice that it is like you know seriously stuck to the packaging itself and then once you get down to this portion right here you notice that there's this part right here that's open and that's actually the part that you need to stick your thumb in so what you do oh and by the way the oil from the cookie sometimes makes it makes this bag a little bit slippery so just be aware of that and that's kind of what I was thinking is it's a it's it's a little bit frustrating I know I'm all for Children's packaging you know child packaging and stuff like that but this is a little it's a little bit difficult especially if it's a little bit oily from the cookie but what you do is you put your thumb down in here and what yours what you're trying to do is you're trying to separate right there you can see how it separates this little ziploc thing here and then once you get that open you're supposed to do something like that and like I said it's a little bit difficult you can see I've already taken in my sighting one cookie here but you know to reclose it you just kind of you know like a normal ziploc bag pinch it down and then just go across and and this thing is like heavy-duty ziplock so no kids are gonna get in there I can guarantee that and I think some you know serious like adults are not going to get in there either because this thing is a little bit difficult but let me try it one more time so you just pop your thumb in there and then separate it out all right let's try that one more time so go ahead open this up this way once you get inside be sure to find the portion where you're supposed to stick your thumb which is separated from the packaging and then you can go ahead and stick your thumb down in there and you can figure out your own technique that I like to do this and then pinch it here once you get your thumb in there just pinch it like that and then you pinch hold and pull and I wouldn't really try to force it because it feels like when you try to force it it almost feels like it it doesn't want to open so that's where the frustration can come in from this packaging I think because it's really there's not a lot to work with at least I don't know cuz my hands a little bigger maybe if you had smaller hands it might be better but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad so one of the things well I can already tell this is been out for a little while but you definitely want to put this in the refrigerator you can see the cookie itself it this has been out of the refrigerator for about I don't know maybe 30 minutes 40 minutes and you can already see how this is starting to like you can see how like kind of I don't even want to say it's a moist it almost it's almost like succulent it's weird but this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much inside and unfortunately I started this video before I should have shown you the whole cookie but I'll show you what's left I'm gonna go ahead and eat this now let me show you how big this cookie really is so it's a decent size I've already eaten almost half of it as you can see excuse me while I finish it kind of has a coconut birthday cake flavor to it and as you can see it's fairly thick and I kind of want to break this off just to show you I mean you can see that this cookie is really really moist I don't want to break it all the way but this to me is almost it's it's it needs to go back in the fridge so definitely store your thing in the fridge like I said since this is a video about childproof packaging you know I just would like to say if you have little ones try to stash it in the best place possible but I'm pretty certain that even if your little one was to find something like this because it's got you know cool graphics on it you know there's a cookie on it or at least something that looks like a cookie it's you know it's enticing so I do think that if your little one did find this I think that would have a very hard time getting into this thing they would have to get very lucky you know their little small fingers might be able to find their way into that but you know the other thing is if your bag is a little bit oily maybe that's a better thing because then you know little fingers will slip off of this thing but anyways hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the Korova Saturday morning

sale if you want to be honest you're the one who tells us I'm the one that oh you're your failure dispensary and help you with your products awesome but I I basically fell into this okay I mean I did this kind of job back in the day sales okay but a friend had told me that they were looking for a person that was good at selling basically and and I went and I talked to him and I was like this is an amazing industry and I'm so passionate about healing and helping you know and that's how it happened I love it yeah about two davana so I started smoking weed in college and I was also following the industry because I thought it was interesting and I decided to write my thesis on the growth of the cannabis industry oh wow and at the same time Maryland's program was getting started so I found Danny Cohen our owner and met with him periodically over the summer after graduation and now I'm here I do marketing and outreach for grassroots so getting hard exactly so you guys may see these people out in the community well again we really appreciate you guys coming by today so let's talk a little bit about what makes grassroots different like why should our patients be purchasing from grassroots over any of the other grows that are out there well first and foremost you know the one thing that I love about this company is its passion for helping and serving me serving my dispensaries us serving the patients and and even our motto is to serve advance and respect them you guys you guys always say that you do we people joining washtech join the movement right right and we have actually been to their grow just beautiful and obviously you guys put your money where your mouth is because we have just received a very large shipment this is RSO for those of you who are wondering it says so right on the container are as Oh which we love that you guys are making that a priority and also making it affordable for the patient yes Aurra so I would say is probably our most medical product out of you know the many that we will have and that we do have now as you know it's helps with cancer tumor so much I mean there's been tons of studies all different ailments and our processor loves making it he says it's fun mm-hmm and I said great because I know they're already so them and Sierra and I have talked about this in the past but are so is really good for patients who are fighting cancer patients who have chronic medical illnesses and planetory disorders so it's got a lot of uses and we're so thrilled that we have a big supply so that we can really help our patients yes we just have to say a heartfelt thank you for doing that and thank you for helping you know that patients know we talked to Matt earlier who was Matt except Matt garbowski who is our head of processing the processing okay in our company though Matt actually gave us some pretty interesting feedback and I wanted to pass that on to our patients who are watching and that is to please respect grassroots RSO because not all RSO is created equal and this is incredibly strong incredibly he doesn't actually expect anybody with any kind of tolerance to be able to tolerate a full syringe daily he wants us to start off just as 1/10 the syringe to begin with and then to work our way up but he's not thinking that we would actually be able to get a full syringe and daily even after a month of trying to increase our tolerance yes I mean I guess it depends on every you know everyone is different every ailment you know every you have to listen to your body and that's you know we always talk about micro dosing right but yeah you know it is so apparently so potent I've never tried it but it's so potent that he wants you to take it easy whereas there might be other products that were less potent or for whatever reason was may different that you can maybe and have a little bit more he also had mentioned that when you ingest rather than this is both edible and smokeable so when you ingest it it's like 10 times more powerful a longer right so it really it's dependent upon that and the way that we ingest it correct or take it in yeah and then also just to clarify that we have two strains we have khaleesi and we have dead cherries and look to him in his estimation there's really essentially no difference between the two and I've looked at these and kind of you know evaluated the terpene profiles they don't look to be any different to me so I think they'll be fairly interchangeable for the patient's yeah it'll be nice okay so that's great information for the patients so yes we have it guys we've got lots of RSO so come and get it that's amazing yes some of the other things that we are carrying that we have in stock because I know we sell out of your stuff a lot I guess we'll start with your favorite this is my favorite a beautiful nightmare it's just a great product I happen to sometimes get heart palpitations when I use a sativa as you lean toward anxiety is that true my friend sometime I have a little anxiety right now that's some time but so I but I like a sativa because I'm and I like birthday and I like right I have a lot to do and this is just a great ride if L it does their main it doesn't upset your hurt no it doesn't it doesn't you might wanna mention about the CBD with that too or no oh yes yes yes because one of the tricks to being able to tolerate this a little bit better is to take CBD as well which we appreciate and the reason why I thought about that at the same time is because sometimes when you do have that that kind of heart-fluttering publication you just you know take a little CBD and it'll that works really well yeah yeah all right here's another real popular crowd-pleaser the Pelle Roja yeah I love that job this is something that sells very well very uplifting and then we have three as your favorite so actually he likes oh you like so Mambo sauce is my favorite so a lot of people like they're really skunky smell or cheesy this one's sweet it's no sweet and so I really enjoy it it burns nice and then what else do we have and then there's sweet D yeah it was named after me my name is Donna I was on that they also did name beautiful nightmare too laughter you just kidding that's just nightmare faceoff is also apparently great for like locations Wow it was just a no it was the pain yeah we're like if you have cramping is that do we talk about Sossamon area painful cramps yeah yeah these patients love the face off for the pain component totally and the one that you're missing is our blue sticker which is our hybrids and some of them lean sativa some of them lean hybrid I mean indica you know but our grower will say there's no such thing our poor patients have heard me talk about that but it's really important to educate the public because you know you see people are maybe not the old for all patients but you know a lot of people are like I need the most THC most THC it's not about the to you it's not it's about the plant and the breakdown all of it and how it's going to be wrong that's correct and it's not just about you know explaining the plant it's about removing that stigma and bringing legitimacy to the industry you know right as part of outreach we speak to anyone who will listen you know we go into hospitals and you know old-age home exactly assess elevating churches temples we try anywhere I'm sit on this conversation right if you show them it's not that scary you know people are curious yeah they know the guy helpful hear about it humans have been using this planet for thousands and thousands of years so now it's just time for the studies to you know watch a street yeah exactly how those of you were watching Dateline last night I know that I'm saying lovely little taste of what's to come so yeah finally we are catching up yeah so and so this is some of the stuff that we have available right now at greenhouse what are some of the things that you guys have in the works for us so actually we just spoke about it today more processing products we have disposable pens that are coming out within a week or two they're called torches they're 500 they are at a nice price point gorgeous it's just you know if you especially for somebody who's not looking to smoke weed but maybe wants to just be able to start off and is new to this type of introduced and we also have chatter coming and waxes and even though you know you wouldn't think that you know somebody who might be older or is is some kind of you know there's a stigma I feel like sure that a lot of people like that a lot of it you know a lot of people like life as well we love libraries and I mean that I like that yeah and it really it can helpful it can help a lot too I really have a medical anodized makes sense to me that you take that whole plant master rs7 exactly higher plan know about everything it gives you every benefit right you know the substrate totally I mean it's just it's a really incredibly we're talking about off camera I used to self-medicate and then I became a patient and it's wild for me to you know know the back stories and know the terpenes and know everything and I'm like oh and might have some crayons or you know whatever it might be and I know that if I take a certain strain it's gonna help me and it does it's pretty and it's wonderful you know your your stomach relaxes you maybe aren't nauseous like it's just amazing fruits balance right it does and it's just wild to me that something like this would have a stigma and we need to be doing community outreach that compared to other but this was filled with oxycontin it would be okay saying and it's just it's crazy it is a little silly yeah you've never heard one person died of an overdose not one nope it's impossible possible but if you take all of this you're gonna be in your areas especially if you eat it because I'll stay in your system for yeah all right well what else did you guys want at the public to know about grassroots is there any last little pearl or anything you want anybody to know well they can always reach out to us if I don't have any questions concerns we are truly here to serve our community and this industry and you guys and we just really believe in this product you're passionate it's not about you know uhyou it's hard to not read things on Facebook it's hard to not be affected by oh this sucks that sucks this is a very young industry right we're there's growing pains but I can promise you from the bottom of our hearts we're in it to help people and make people feel better and you know just how it not be such a not be illegal and I just you know be able to feel better well we have I finger questions we have a question from Blake he wants to know what you guys have thoughts are on oil color you see sometimes an amber color versus good dark which I've seen yeah and what causes the difference in color when processing well I was told and again I'm no chemist by any means okay but what I was told by our head processer Matt garbowski that you know I again I saw him Facebook bleep that there you know somebody said that's not RSO it's too light it's supposed to be tar it's chlorophyll right there's all different processes but Matt believe if he will tell you that it when you put it on something and you rub it out it should be like a golden color it should not be at our it should not be I think those are the impurities quite a yes is that what it is so yeah but I haven't have Reds on and and people just need to be educated right so thanks for the question Blake yeah that's a great question all right guys well I think that about wraps it up for our motivating wasn't that they hardly needed any CBD to get through this just all right guys well thank you so much for joining us you'll see us again next Monday for our next Medical Monday [Music]", "KU6YR3HGRwI": "may seem like a sugary fruit you wouldn't want to eat if you had blood sugar problems but eating them can reduce inflammation and improve your heart health if you have metabolic disease or even diabetes previous research at the University of Connecticut shows that Paula feels the natural plant chemicals found in grapes that help them stay Harvey in all kinds of environments help reduce blood pressure improve blood flow and fight inflammation that can lead to atherosclerosis a new study published last month confirmed this effect the results of this study show that grape polyphenols have significant effects on the level of blood glucose liepard profile blood pressure as well as beneficial activities in liver and heart wrote the author's metabolic syndrome is a cluster of health problems that frequently occur simultaneously and increase your risk for diabetes and heart disease they include elevated blood pressure high blood sugar excess body fat around the waist low levels of HDL good cholesterol and high levels of blood triglycerides blood fats metabolic syndrome is a major public health concern and is on the rise in the USA these results suggest that consuming grapes can improve important risk factors associated with heart disease in a population that is already at higher risk says researcher maria luz fernandez this further supports the accumulating evidence that grapes came positively influenced heart health and extends it to men with metabolic syndrome all you need to do is eat a small bunch of grapes something like 15 or so medium-sized spread out through the day as part of a diabetes plan and you can eat a few more if you're not diabetic there is no type of great better than another try for a mix of red black and green grapes", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "oQvaracTkvQ": "[Music] [Music] hey pet parents dr. T here I wanted to talk about something that just happened with me we were sitting there watching TV and I heard Jameson say Bailey oh he did it very calmly so what had happened was he was eating grapes my son and he dropped one and Bailey grabbed it he was trying to get it out of Billy's mouth but Bailey being golden it was well gone so what you may not know is that some dogs can eat several grapes and not have an issue with them some dogs can eat one grape and go into acute kidney failure I don't know Bailey Bailey is a foster he's is the hub my dog he's a guest in our house he's awesome though he's an awesome dog so what to do well the best thing to do in a situation like that if you're if your dog ate a grape and worried about toxicity timing is important you want to get that doctor vomit so at the clinic I have this injectable drug called April morphine that just boom give it to a dog and within two minutes they are vomiting and everything that that needs to come up comes up I'm gonna put a copy of the hare is that not all toxins do you want to induce vomiting but grapes are one that it's all about timing it's all about you want to make sure that the stomach hasn't digested it or emptied it because it's too late to induce vomiting so in this case it's within three minutes I run upstairs I grab the hydrogen peroxide that we have which is a 3% solution if you give approximately three to five CCS for every ten pounds of body weight he's a hundred pounds so I knew I can give like 30 CC's of hydrogen peroxide so luckily for me I had a 6 cc syringe so I just put the tiger pox that in a bowl sucks him up gave it to him literally within less than 5 minutes he was vomiting and up came a whole bunch of undigested food because dogs like him they don't chew they inhale and a whole grape as you can see here and he felt nauseous and I let his stomach settle and then I gave him a little pep sit afterwards he's doing great now I'm gonna get my snack later on but but I just want to talk to you about something like that I think it's important if a grape toxicity can lead to kidney failure you just don't know how many grapes a dog can take before this happens so it's best to call your veterinarian there are a lot of emergency numbers you can call the SPCA poison control they can guide you they can work with you they can give you a case number that you can take to a veterinarian in this particular case you want to induce vomiting and so I did and he's feeling good and I'm really happy Jameson's happy everyone's happy Bailey's happy to remember everyone loved your pet like they love you unconditionally have a great day [Music] you [Music]", "jtlJqBuXuzk": "alright hey y'all get ready to make some candy grapes alright the first thing you'll need is a bag of Jolly Ranchers I got the bag that was I think 248 at Walmart and first thing you gonna toss up I wrapped with the Jolly Ranchers and I'm using my blender to chop them up and I end up pressing post and it chopped it up to fine some people that have this like what kind of bigger pieces in my I was like powder kinda alright and right here you can see that how fine I made it the only thing with a jolly wrench day it's gonna get back you get hard so I end up putting it back in a blender later on alright next you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar I can get another cup of sugar [Music] there's a second cup of shirt alright next is a half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the Cairo sir when you put all of it into your partner and I just use a small pot because it's not gonna make them rich all right and this thing make sure you mix it up pretty good before you get ready to put it on the stove so you don't try to mix it up while it's cooking and with the heat on the stove this temperature saying I put it between four or five or so [Music] alright next one get ready to cook it alright you have to let the temperature reach between two hundred and eighty degrees and two hundred and ninety degrees under cooking thermometer so make sure you watching it cuz you don't want to burn it and be careful you don't want to burn yourself all right this is parchment paper not wax paper make sure you use parchment paper alright then I have my bowl of grits I've washed and dried those all right and then I have two pieces if you have any longer sticks you want to use you can use those because to me it's the kind of dangerous because you can burn yourself with it so small do not put the soup in the hole that's our baton the great with the grapes tin came from you make your own hole on the opposite cuz it'll stick better the hole on the other side is kind of big already I'll have my line that already [Music] all right it's cooking here makes you glad to get it two hundred and eighty degrees all right here's I just took it off the stove this is outlook right with it also all right next thing is you gonna need some flavor and the flavoring I use is the Lawrence flavor I use cheering and it's the bottle synthesizes a dream I only use half a bottle since I didn't make that much and it's gonna turn it red that's in the brain in it all right Mitchell see me add in another drop of the flavor just get a little flavor but after that you weigh if you have the liquid white food coloring in the jail that's when you add that you don't see me use it because I went to last minute trying to find some but using the liquid white learn it would give your stuff a brighter color so I want to be see through my stuff you'll see it's let me see - have a seat - color eye whatever but I didn't care cuz kids I know they was still eating but so give it that deep coloring you need the white liquid gel color and then we use your color that you wanted to be but now you're gonna see me and then I have just regular gel food cuz I'm using the colored seal and again it's gonna be basically almost air clear when I put it on the grades because I didn't have the whitener so again make sure if you want the bright colors that you see everybody else using use the white liquid gel color the whitener and then you're gonna use like a few drops to everything I didn't you see me just scooping some till your food coloring my Chi mix it up that my sister she started dipping already and you gotta make sure you working fastest and starting heart and hard and fast and I still ting to pot to the side so I can make sure lit all around to the side all right you start dipping it but then you see my candy and hey got heart the Jolly Rancher candy and I end up later on putting it back inside the blender to chop it up again good say the thing with the Jolly Rancher is it says for some reason because it's so sticky I know hardest but you go ahead and just make sure you working fast cuz the candy that you made will get hard fast and the Jolly Rancher soon so just dip it and I don't want to do have I didn't some people that I dip the whole thing I only did half of it great and we end up doing strawberry so we didn't record record ourselves on the strawberries and when you dip it just hurry up and sprinkle a pot on before it gets hard and they're just laid on a parchment paper all right here you can kind of see it better what a good grapes doesn't see just really missing again you see my stuff is fired it's pretty fine like a little powder some people have bigger chunks with Jolly Ranchers than theirs but it all stays the same all right this is finished product it came out pretty good for the first time if you want to see my kids do the taste test check out her Channel say whatcha Larry thanks for watching", "6eOw9MLpuKA": "[Music] 20 I'm back with an overview I am at the auditorium or whatever right here in Los Angeles and I'm better Munch out on these stony patches that I just got a dispensary let's see how these are they look like sour patches I better take the whole 350 milligrams the whole thing I'm about to take the whole thing while I'm out here cuz I got like an hour parking and I'm not trying to really wait I've been waiting to eat them at the house but we've been out all day so I'm even here look the different colors they're little squares they're not the little sour patch figures and I got about like 10 of them so they smell like candy I do smell a little bit different in between they don't taste different that all tastes the same no matter what color they were um first time I ever see these they look like the exotic cards for some reason but they're edible got a matter dispensary for $15 so why not I will be coming back they get an hour to to see what the fix were and let you know they were worth the $15 or not so for now just stay tuned and Cheers and stay hi hi guys I'm back as I breathing for 23 hours later after taking 350 milligram edible I did not feel anything guys I went to the observatory in LA and I was up there for like 2 3 hours and they did not even kick in I had my moon rock art and I think after like 2 hours that I waited to see if they kicked in I just started hitting on the moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15 bucks down the drain but you know you pay for what you get or you get you get what you pay for and these two out of 10 don't even try ever if you come to LA so let me know if you want me to do more edibles don't forget to Like and subscribe comment down below and stay tuned and stay high [Music]", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "tcy7F8gmRvY": "you did not eat like you you didn't eat that good you can't just eat those bad cuz you're gonna be messed up don't do anything you're a you're kidding you're gonna be really high I don't think so you feel like what like being on a merry-go-round oh is this your good boys of water you don't wanna bring your water I'm just I just don't want to get up and bring you water Oreo cookies what no how do you feel you're such a liar really oh I was supposed to take one not two so I took twice as much as I should have I forgot that she phoned me this one Lena get you Oreo cookies she gave me like three and I asked for 12 but she wouldn't give me give you these right yeah fake Oreos I got you something those are good is much filling in these I got you the best the leaning", "kVI6X3fVnQY": "hey guys this is girl hermes welcome back to my channel says today we is getting lit if you are not 21 over please click off this video but today you guys i'm going to be eating some edibles so i decided to copy stoney gummies but i actually had these before but honestly just one like tab is it is enough to get you you know buzz or feel high but i'm gonna have more today okay i have it in watermelon i have it in papaya and i have it in cherry lime so these are all of the different flavors you know what i'm saying and this is how they look like so it comes with five gummies it comes with five gummies and it's extra strength 350 milligrams of thc so i'm guessing that the whole entire package is 350 milligrams my friend gave me one tab before and i just felt a little high i don't know i don't know you know what i'm saying but i'm only gonna have two today so i'm going to pick two two gummies that i want i'm gonna have two of those i'm also gonna have these nugs so these are medicated chocolate cookies and cream nugs you know what i'm saying so we'll see how these look like once i open them so i'm going to pick two of these i'm just going to pick two random ones and those are the two ones those are the two i'm going to try for you guys all right so i have these two in my hands so let's see what they are this is the cherry lime and this is the papaya i love you want to try the watermelon but it's cool it's cool so i'm gonna try the papaya first y'all my hardest raisin a little bit because every time every time i eat edibles y'all it literally don't work for me i either don't feel i either don't feel nothing either i stepped through it whatever the case may be i've never like had a full-blown high off of it edible but anyways this is the papaya it looks orange it's orange and like i said before these are little tabs i do not suggest consuming this whole entire thing y'all but 350 milligrams isn't a lot for me you know what i'm saying so it all depends on your tolerance we'll start off with start off with one and then move on so we rip one off this is the papaya one so let's try that it's currently 6 37 and yeah it usually takes an hour or so for edibles to kick in way longer than smoking you know i'm saying way longer time than actually hitting a joint so there we go and you just gotta suck that bad boy out you know what i'm saying so this is i don't know how many milligrams in here but not bad at all no wheat smell no we taste no saying very discreet if you're trying to be discreet so no issues with that now i have the cherry lime one i want to take that i'm so scared i'm looking getting scared i don't know if i should just have one of these and then one of the nugs all right how about this i'm gonna have two of these right and then in an hour at 7 30 i'm going to see how i feel i don't feel like you know super lit then i'll take the i'll take the nugs as well so i'm gonna take another cherry or should i just try the nugs right now right all right i'm just gonna try the nuts instead the the nuggets then but with the nugs you guys this is 450 milligrams you know what i'm saying 450. it's definitely higher than the sony gummies so i might not even need another stone yummy i might take notes for me don't i might take another stoney gummy depending on how i feel so these are just chocolate bars in here i thought it was going to be those nugs that are chocolate but it looks like weed you know what i'm saying that's what i thought those were going to be but i guess not but anyways these are some pretty it's like a pr it's like a cube it's like a chocolate cube and this is cookies and cream cookies and cream is my favorite if you did not know because in korean my favorite chocolate bar it's one of my favorite chocolate bars and yeah so let's give this a try don't smell like weed i don't think it's that good it has it tastes like cookies and cream but it has a like an aftertaste to it it tastes a little like it tastes a little spoiled you know what i'm saying i don't know so with the nugs you get six you get six chocolate um bars and these have and there's different flavors of these also so i got cookies and cream and yeah you guys it's kind of sexy it's currently 6 40 and i'm going to come back in an hour or so to other you guys so stay tuned you know i'm saying all right so i was pretty comfy in my bed as you guys can see but i don't care about the setup right now but anyways you guys it is one hour later you know what i'm saying where's my phone right there it is one hour later and it is 7 38 you know i was saying i took the idols around an hour ago and i honestly don't feel anything like i don't feel abuzz i don't feel slightly nothing so so with that being said i'm going to try the other one of the gummy sony gummies i'm going to try the cherry lime one now since i don't feel much at all i'm going to try the cherry lime one now and yeah the 75 milligrams per chocolate bar and with the gummies it's 70 milligrams per gummy so i've had i have one stony gummy i'm about to have another one so that's 140 plus the 75 that's 270 milligrams yeah i don't think that's much for me so i'm going to take another one i'm about to take another another tab this is not good cherry lime but anyways you guys it's 7 42 now i'm about to wait another hour and another hour i'll be right back if i still don't feel nothing i'm gonna have another chocolate bar so let's see y'all by the way i paid 20 a pop for these so i'm pretty sure i could find these cheaper online but i paid 20 a pop for these and for everything but are they worth it i don't know because i don't know because it's like i have to eat a lot for me to feel anything so watching some youtube videos about to go back to that i'll see you guys in a little bit okay honestly i feel a tad bit like i felt have a bit high you know i'm saying but okay um yeah i guess there i guess it's kicking in now it's currently nine o'clock and i took the edible at the last one at seven anyways you guys i'm hungry i'm starving you know i'm saying so i have me some pizza this is my second slice of the day so this is my second slice um i had one slice before um i took the edibles so that's why i feel like it took forever for it to kick in because i had you know i had a meal before i had my edible but it was like two hours before two hours before i even started y'all and i haven't uh you're making me happy so yeah i think that's why let's a lot for the edibles to kick in i gotta go i gotta start going back to my meal prep smoking [ __ ] because now i'm just you know i'm going back to my old habits again i can't be doing that you know what i'm saying says i can't be doing that so so my husband go back to my meal prep because maybe tomorrow i should do it tomorrow tomorrow saturday tomorrow saturday but i want to be filming

see you guys in my next video bye", "XHcIX8pKj8w": "[Music] i have to come on here and say this again because it's a couple days later but these are so good i had no idea how much i was gonna like them i'm usually not a huge chocolate strawberry person but with the cookies on them oh my god you guys they're amazing what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you guys how to make chocolate covered strawberry milks they look like nugs but they aren't nuts it's true um so yeah these don't include any um weed but i am using coconut oil on them so if you want to swap the coconut oil for something else i mean to each their own you can do whatever you like but yeah these are really easy to make i think you guys are going to like them let's get to the recipes so here's my strawberries they're not the best strawberries i've ever seen um for a couple reasons one i can't find strawberries for some reason i finally found some and as soon as i saw them i went to the store my eyes were like zoomed like right into them i like booked it it was the last little container of them yeah they're not that good but and then they've been sitting in my fridge for like three or four days i'm needing to film this video but if you watch my last video where i was like crying and stuff i just i wasn't feeling the best this weekend and i wasn't really in a place to be filming a video i don't really like filming videos unless i'm like feeling good um but yeah i'm feeling good now so um let's make these chocolate covered strawberries so the first thing you need to do is wash and dry your strawberries i did this yesterday well because i hadn't intentions to make this video yesterday but you want to watch enjoy them because if they have moisture on them they're not going to last very well so this is like very very crucial because no matter how good you do all the other steps because moisture on your strawberries they won't turn out well so you need to make sure they're nice nicely dried to make these all you're going to need is some golden oreos or cookies that look like this some strawberries chocolate i'm using chocolate chips but you could use nitro chocolate and some green food coloring and maybe some coconut oil if you want we're going to crush our oreos to make the outside coating for the strawberries um you don't have to use uh oreos you could use any sort of cookie that has this type of color so there's lots of cookies like that and you can do this we're gonna crush them and you could do it in a bag you could do it in a blender i have a food processor so i'm gonna use that but um like i said you could use many different things to crush them and pour that in there okay now we're going to color them and i have a few different food colorings i have like different shades of green um and i have some yellow if i want to like kind of play around with it but i feel like you can just whatever you want right i think i'm gonna do this moss green that looks like it'll be good so i'm gonna color most of this green and then i'm gonna color a little bit of purple to get that um accurate nut looking if you don't have purple or you don't have what is it that makes purple blue and red makes purple i think i'm not sure you can look up if you don't have things to make purple you could also use regular oreos like the blackish brown oreos to kind of get that contrast of color or you could just do green and just do different shades of it you don't need much of the purple so i'm just gonna set aside a little bit of um some of these to color people and then these ones we're going to color different colors of green or different shades of green okay i'm thinking this gel food coloring is going to be too difficult to use that's going to be a hassle to color that all so let's use the liquid thank god i have that on hand and i could have done this in the um food press processor or blend or whatever but food coloring oh my goodness i don't want to get food coloring everything because i make a mess with food coloring but you could do it in there i feel like this purple is not going to be fun to get to mix i feel like i might have to microwave this one so that um the gel food coloring can be a little tricky to get to mix just what i keep at home so i mean i would recommend not using gel for coloring and just use regular food coloring okay i'm just gonna put those in the microwave quickly because it's just not mixing now we can get to the actual strawberries so like i said i'm eating chocolate chips you could use a nicer chocolate but this is just what i chose so you can do this over a double boiler i'm going to use a microwave i know you guys love when i use the microwave just kidding if you're new everybody here they hate when i use my kids like why did you use microwave i just i like the microwave okay i'm gonna need more chocolate than that so this is we're gonna add the coconut oil now you can use whatever coconut oil you like if you know what i mean but um i'm just using this one and this is to make it easier to dip so it doesn't like um be so like thick and also keeps it since we're microwaving it it's going to keep it liquidier so that i don't have to constantly re-melt it whereas like if you're keeping the chocolate over a double boiler you aren't really going to need to have to worry about it needing to remelt but i always add a little bit of oil to my chocolate when i'm dipping it in anything and the amount is not super important this is like it's like a little bit less than a tablespoon and i have a cup of chocolate chips here but i don't follow a certain ratio it's just that's just what i'm using here so i'm gonna go microwave that and i'll be right back okay so i melted the chocolate in the microwave and it's important when you melt chocolate in the microwave but you do it in increments of like 10 15 20 seconds you just don't want to put it in there for like a whole minute and then take it out because it'll burn into this wall so just do it for a little bit of time stir it a little by time stir it and you can use white chocolate candy melts whatever it doesn't matter when you're dipping them you can use a toothpick you can use your fingers i'm going to be using my fingers to just me eating them um or i'll try both we'll see what works better and i just have some parchment paper here that i'm gonna line them on and i'm using roomish coldish temperature um strawberries again don't judge my not so good looking strawberries they've been sitting around for a while okay so you'll dip it in chocolate and then you can either wait for the excess to drip off or you can just like scrape it off considering we're covering it in this it doesn't really matter if it looks perfect but i don't like too much chocolate on it because then it's just like too much chocolate not enough strawberry but don't get me wrong like a lot of chocolate but trust me you're going to be eating a lot of chocolate when you're eating these so i like to get as much as i can off and then we're just going to i feel like this toothpick is going to fall off okay so there's the first one yeah that toothpick is not so secure i'm just gonna set it on my tray there i feel like the toothpicks are kind of pointless i'm gonna try without get a bit of a better grip here just had the camera over here turned off i thought it was wrong but i mean i'm sure you guys can kind of see what i'm doing but let's just now i have it back on here and that's kind of how they look let me show you guys close up although i'll show you guys again after and i kind of like when they look a little bit messy because it makes them look a little bit more i don't know real instead of like a perfect strawberry like having those little like bumps on them and it looks kind of nice and i'm sure you guys have noticed the little hearts in the background that's because i thought this would be a super cute um idea for valentine's day and i tried so hard to try and find a heart-shaped box because i thought these would be so cute um if you put them in like these and then put them into a heart-shaped box just like chocolate but i could not find a heart-shaped box i did not look that hard i also didn't want to like just buy a heart-shaped box like just for the video to like not use because i'm not giving these to anyone they are for me my sister will probably eat them together i think this one's going to look nice it's a nice little shape you know we might not actually need more chocolate i thought we were going to but it looks like this should be enough these stems are a little rough looking since i've like took so long to get to this video but it kind of kind of goes with the the look maybe i don't know [Music] yeah see i kind of have a blob of chocolate on this one so that's just me being lazy don't get lazy but with these ones you can kind of like fix them by just adding more of this cookie on it and because like i said they don't have to look perfect and almost not looking perfect kind of like makes them look more real that's okay [Music] so yeah they are pretty much done this is all you have to do and then you um if you want to eat them right away you can put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes let them set um but otherwise they're actually best uh best served or best stored room temperature so you can leave them in at like a coolish room temperature um and yeah you can put them in the fridge if you like but they will sweat in the fridge they have to be careful with that i think i'm gonna put mine in these little liners and that's it guys they're done they're so easy to make they turned out so cute i think they're adorable well mine still need to cool so they're not um like hardened yet but yes i think they look beautiful and very happy with them they're so cute i'm gonna try eating one now and see how it tastes i just have to take my invisalign out first i don't actually know if i'm gonna like them because honestly i don't know if i like the idea of cookies on the outside of strawberries like i like cookies but i don't know if i like it together so let's find out we'll see i like cookies on strawberries they're actually really really good i think you're gonna be a little bit better in the fridge i think i put a little bit too much coconut oil in the chocolate because i can kind of taste the coconut oil maybe use a little bit less it's really just for smoothing out the chocolate but yeah they're delicious thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you all have a wonderful day and valentine's day if you're watching this around that time thank you guys bye [Music] you", "oUg7W9EtOyE": "[Music] this video will show you how to properly use your sublingual trochee also known as the trish or a lozenge this is a dissolvable medication that can be made with a gelatin or wax base to use your trophies first you'll want to wash your hands with warm soapy water before getting started it comes in a prescription container like this so you'll want to take the prescription cover off and then this plastic packaging to make it a little bit easier to work with you can actually twist and kind of select the packaging to loosen it and one side comes with the lid so you can open that lid up and then you'll see that they're pretty easy to separate and if you want to make make it a little bit easier you can flip it and kind of push one out so that would be one method of dispensing and you can see that's easily flexing out or you can flip it back around and then kind of play around with the pieces until you get them out but they should easily kind of separate once you play around with ink come out as a clean piece if the doctor prescribed less than a full trophy it is scored and easy to cut with a knife in 2/4 or 1/2 if needed the trophy should be used as directed by your physician it can be placed either between the teeth and the gums the side of your teeth or under the tongue allow it to fully dissolve for complete absorption of the medication this can take up to fifteen to thirty minutes the goal is to have the medication enter your system through the oral mucosal membrane layer through your skin rather than being swallowed do not eat drink or brush your teeth for 30 minutes after using the medication it is best practice to rotate the location where you place the troche to prevent any irritation these medications can be sweetened or flavored upon request due to the sweetness or flavor of this medication be sure to keep it out of reach from children most trophies do not need to be kept refrigerated they can be stored in a cool dry location or at room temperature do not leave them in your car in direct sunlight or warm places because they can melt if you have any

serve all of our diverse communities and is made possible by the generous support of our members thank you live from Maryland public television this is direct connection with Jeff Salkin welcome to direct connection we are live tonight from the state's largest grower of medical marijuana these plants which it would be illegal to have outside of this building are the beginning of the growing process here at curio wellness joining us is Michael Braun fine curio CEO thanks for having us nice to come in Jeff first question is why am I wearing the bunny suit because this is a plant where we grow raw material to create medicine and so under FDA regimes it has to be hygienic we don't use any type of pesticides insecticides or any other crop control agent except or law of water and fertigation and people may hear this is a noisy environment it's the air purification it's bright LED lights tell me about the business this has been live for over a year now what's happened in that here it's been an exciting time and candidly a lot of time of great learning when you undertake a new disruptive industry you build a theoretical model about what you think it's going to be and then you create an actual operating plan and then you learn you've made plenty of mistakes and I've played it wrong in substance but you had some good ones also and and so we have evolved literally 180 degrees over this first year through a lean management system and some other techniques we use to the point where this is a very well oiled machine now where we're delivering large quantities a product every week with no defects and great customer satisfaction globally we got beyond your company what's happened to medical cannabis in over the last year or two I think it's become more more accepted as a true medicinal product and I think some of the historical negatives or things that people thought they were probably aided by the government with your Falls are starting to clear way so it's kind of dark clouds going away and interestingly the largest cohort of growth for us has been baby boomers and I suspect first of all they probably had some castle experience back in college but more importantly they got a lot of aches and pains and traditional medicines can sometimes be interactive in a way that's not very good and the medicinal cannabis plan is very safe it has very low interaction tolerance so it allows you to use it with many other things at low levels in a very effective way let's explain how the system works in Maryland designed by the legislature there are licenses for growers and retailers essentially and somebody in the middle what what do you have so there are three different licenses there is a cultivation license to grow the plants there is a processing or manufacturing license to create the product that is in some other form you extract the oil from the plant and then you turn it into other pills capsules like and then there's a retail distribution network those are the dispensaries we're fortunate to be one of seven companies that has all three licenses but our primary business is to enable the success of the dispensers across the state by giving them our products on a very regular and consistent basis you're a business guy trail of successful healthcare businesses private equity businesses so you didn't come into this I don't believe as a marijuana expert you've learned something about these plants the things behind us the big ones it looks like a topiary a sort of thing and then we have these little cuttings yes sir these came from that that's correct these are called mother plants we use a cloning process so that we could get the genetics from a particular strain exactly the same from crop the crop plant the plant so we have a proprietary process for picking seeds turning them into the best by winning out the weaker genetics through both growing and testing we have a lab here and then once we get to the prime prop if you will will use one of these mother plants for approximately four months the first thing we do with the new mother is we take cuttings and start creating the new baby that's going to become the next mother because these mothers have a useful life where the quality of the plant is determined by how many cuttings you click that as it gets older they diminish in quality so we focus on measuring certain cannabinoid content and other markers of health and yield and we try to maximize the life of the plant to optimize that yield let me remind our viewers if you have a question about medical cannabis shortly we're going to be talking to the head of the pharmacy the dispensing operation you can send us an email no phone calls tonight but send an email to live questions at mptv.org and we'll try to get your question answered during the program what's your competition like and and how do you do things differently than the rest of the market well one of a very few that are only dedicated to medicinal cannabis we are not in favor of nor do we want adult use because we think Maryland is a place where we can build an ecosystem in an industry that creates exportable intellectual property and products and we'd like to see that happen in fact we've just worked with the legislature on a new bill to allow for academic research here in Maryland and so most of the companies haven't made the investment in the pharmaceutical grade environment and equipment that we've had and they don't have people from big pharma like we have we're working with chemistry and drug discovery and such things there are some very fine companies out there and then there's some companies that really just want to grow cannabis because they think it's a good thing and they think they can make money doing it but they're not dedicated to the investment research and development that we are the trend is moving in the direction as you said of varying degrees of legalization whether recreational becomes law in Maryland at some point or not but federal law has changed Congress passed President signed a bill and I think it was a side item in the bill but it makes CBD and I get that letters mixed up that's correct but it basically legalizes CBD and hemp is that right it legalizes the CBD that's derived from him CBD could come from hemp or it could come from the cannabis plant they're both derivative of an original plant the hemp plant has very very low acid less than 0.03 percent THC the psychoactive agent that's in cannabis in if it were to qualify for his half and so now because of the farm bill which what you're referring to people will be able to on a state-by-state basis decide what level of participation the Hef market they want so they've kind of maybe the state's Rights Act but with a pure go-ahead from the federal government CBD is the stuff that gets all the press lately does it affect your business model if somebody without all of this investment overhead it can grow acres of hemp and refined CBD out of it less expensively potentially yes and no it really doesn't because in our case we could grow at very low costs and in addition we have to have certain levels of purity and we don't know yet if hemp can deliver that because we've never work with it but we know we can get it from cannabis so we now a full flower or hygienic cultivation chambers we call them that's filled with a 18 to 1 CBD to THC ratio plant which we use for our CBD products ultimately I think if it is available and it's pure we'll buy it as a raw material just like we buy other raw materials that we don't create on our own first question in my email how can somebody invest in this industry your privately held but not everybody is there is a about 30 or 40 new newly minted canadian public stocks to which actually trade on american exchanges and so you can pick through one of those one of our local competitors here we happen to think a lot of is a company called GTI they've recently went public so you know there's a lot of companies out there that we think are very good but their public this is a family-owned business we have outside investors but we're going to continue to just build it and grow it and keep it i have a bunch of emails on some of the more technical questions about prescribing so what we're going to do is take a break and we will come back

[Music] back live at curieux wellness at an undisclosed location in Baltimore County I'm joined by Brian sanderoff who runs the side of the business that sells things to people how do you describe what you do over there so on the general manager and the clinical director of the dispensary so my job is to make sure that one we're helping patients making sure that they're getting the right products the right way counsel patients all day long also make sure that we're living up to all of the regulatory requirements that we don't do anything wrong what's the last year they've been like for you it's been a whirlwind it's just unbelievable so our dispensary has been open for about 10 months 11 months now and it's just been fantastic surprise after surprise every day I get up excited to go to work seeing what I'm going to learn let me ask you a slightly skeptical question which is what I do I mean clearly a lot of people are being helped by this but you also read increasingly about people smoking this stuff psychoses impaired driving how do you think about the balance between taking the good stuff and and people maybe not knowing what to do with the dangerous parts so the way that I approach to this is that I want people to be able to use this in a guided way and using it in an unguided way it's much more likely to cause problems than if you're using it guided properly so that plant contains hundreds of bioactive compounds and matching the right ones to the right person with the right condition is how you eliminate or real you know lower the chance of having problems the intermediate step that Michael was talking about between grow these things and sell this stuff which we'll talk about right describe the functionality there how does it work and and how is it evolving it's amazing the way it's evolving and especially the way that we occur you go after it making sure that what we're making is reliable it's repeatable we know it's going to be effective for people more like a pharmaceutical than it is an herb more the science than the art of using this medicine we we mind the research we do some research on our own we put together products that we think are going to be effective we test them alright we haven't we haven't talked about this stuff before but but I'll ask it in terms of the most common complaints that people walk in the door with and and how some of this may be able to help me Payne definitely I can't tell you how many patients I have who are no longer on opioids where they were six months ago a year ago sleep is a big issue a lot of autoimmune diseases things like ms neurological problems like Parkinson's or ALS anxiety all right so what might you yeah a whole variety of products that are available here in all sorts of different forms so this is a container that would actually contain the flour the raw flour that someone would grind down and then either smoke or consume with the vaporizer these are packages for the actual vapes that we have and so this is an oil that someone would attach to a battery and vaporize that there are pre-rolled cannabis products I'm sorry we used to call these joints now they're called free rolls right or there's all sorts of ways to consume the medicine in a different way so this is a tincture that somebody would put underneath their tongue and it would absorb through the mucosa in their mouth there's some advantages to doing it that way one of the things as a pharmacist I love about that is that I can be very very specific with the dosage that I'm giving somebody there are topicals there are all sorts of concoctions that people use viewer writes in and says you mentioned not being completely supportive of recreational abuse can you elaborate on that so as I said I want people and it's funny because I don't even think in terms of adult use versus medical anymore I just think in terms of guided versus unguided and what I want to do is make sure that people are using this medicine in the most appropriate way for them and there could be lots of ways that it may be used inappropriately maybe there's interactions with prescription medicines that they're on maybe the combination of cannabinoids that someone uses isn't really good for someone that has anxiety and so I just want people to use it in a guided way how good is the data that the guidance is based on it gets to this email from a viewer for adults over 50 who need to manage pain are there long-term studies concerning short and long term memory loss so yes there are although I have to say that a lot of the studies don't come from the United States because of the constraints that have been put on cannabis here in the in the United States it's been difficult for institutions to do the kind of studies that we're used to but we can look to Israel we can look to Europe we can look to Canada where they've been doing studies and there are the short-term memory thing is completely manageable if we're using the right combination of medicine and if it were to happen to somebody when they stopped using the medicine that problem has a tendency to go away but I can tell you with 11 months of clinical experience I have not seen that problem how does it work in Maryland the nuts and bolts of it somebody can't just walk in off the street to your office and walk out with something correct so the step one is they have to become registered they do that online they go to the MMC C which is the Maryland medical cannabis commission website click on the button for patients and you upload some information and then you become registered that process right now is taking somewhere between two and four weeks assuming all those things are correct you'll get a 16 digit number that starts with the letter P for patient step two is then to become a certified patient which means you have to go to a prescriber or a recommender who will certify that you are a valid patient for using cannabis once that done then you can go into a dispensary and get medicine there was a pretty liberal definition of who the prescribers can be here right you don't have to be an MD well so you could be an MD you can be a nurse practitioner you could be a podiatrist or a dentist if I if I had that correct they all have to be able to prescribe controlled substances right now so you have to have a c.d.s license to be able to recommend this okay viewer wants to know can medical cabinet cannabis alleviate pain from Lyme disease have you seen Lyman I've had several patients that I can think of right away that have had success with that so it's not necessarily the Lyme that it's treating it's the pain part of that cannabis has shown to be has been shown to be anti-inflammatory very very helpful for pain well let's see the question about him and I asked Michael about this this earlier the federal government basically legalizing CBD through the hemp channel that's on that we use it we sell it to our patients they don't have to be members or registered within the Commission to be able to use it basically you can get it over the counter okay see so you can sell some stuff to people who are not registered that's correct so hemp Durai of CBD doesn't really have THC in it and can be very effective although I'll tell you that clinically most of us feel that CBD with at least a little bit of THC is more effective than CBD by itself okay all those letters confuse me a little bit THC is the stuff that people who are into recreationally that's the that's the one where you can feel some euphoria from where has CBD been tested I mean what do we actually know about it other than it's hot at the moment well it has been tested and we do see results with pain for anxiety for energy helping with sleep if that sleep problem is related more to anxiety and pain muscle relaxation seizures immune function all of those issues or conditions have been shown to be helped by CBD CBD from hemp hemp is sort of like a cousin of cannabis so it supplies the CBD which is another can happen I didn't by the way there's I think they've discovered over a hundred different cannabinoids now and so when you and I have this discussion in a year and then another year we'll we'll know so much more how often do people consult dr. Google before they they come see you in other words how much how much research are our people doing how accurate is the stuff that people find online about these products I'd say the accuracy is about the same as in regular medicine when people consult doctor Google you can find some good information and some bad information that's why people come to us that's why I'd like to see people use it in a guided way and use it that guidance from a health professional who understands biochemistry potential interactions with other medicines that someone might be using I would say that a lot of my patients especially the sort of cannabis naive patients they haven't done any research they've heard about it either from their doctor or from a neighbor they get certified and then they come in and then they rely on us to help educate them what's happening in the medical community so you were a long-term licensed pharmacist do you think the establishment the medical establishment is becoming more favorable not to what degree what do you think what do you see yeah there's sort of three camps out there and there's the ones who are the adopters who understand it who see results with their patients and like it there's that camp that says I'm not sure I don't know about it and then there's a camp that says no you can't use it or you shouldn't use it and so I'd say it's changing and it's it's shifting and probably this shift is most responsible for that shift is patients coming in telling their doctors that they're getting results very good Brian sanderoff curio Wellness thank you for

curio wellness Michael Braun fine is the CEO here how many are standing next to a lovely plant by the way how many how many folks have you hired in starting this up so far we've had 105 people and I'm proud to say that over the course of the first 18 months 18 of them have been promoted from an entry-level job to a mid manager from amid to a higher level and we instituted once we passed over break-even a living wage so our minimum wage in this building is $15 what are most of those folks doing I know there's a big production operation here yes what are most of the jobs like so there's really kind of semi skilled and highly skilled so 70 school would be people that do horticulture preparation pruning planning all the things required to tender to the plants and then the trimming curing and packaging lumber those take various levels the skill sets that we've developed trading programs and best practices around all those on the manufacturing side we have chemists we have pharmacologists we have people who are involved in analytical work and so there's a number of advanced degree people who are doing drug discovery formulation and then we have a manufacturing team who takes the oil that we create they purify they separate it and then they create recipes and we create products where do you think there might be misconceptions among regulators among your fellow business people among members of the public about just what has happened since this might live in Maryland and and what the business is all about I think probably the first misconception is that people don't appreciate the level of quality the maryland program has we have an excellent testing protocol here so the public is getting very safe product no medals no pesticides no contaminants of all and and all of us all the growers in this state have to abide by a very very strict regulatory regime for hygienic quality so we're providing cannabis and cannabis derived products that are highly pure where can people get more information well they can go to our website curie wellness.com they can go to the maryland medical cannabis commissioner by the way we call it cannabis not marijuana it's its proper name so well I say can I say marijuana sometimes so people understand what I'm talking about we're trying to change the conversation that's a lot of part of what our strategy's about it talking about science and facts as opposed to other things so but the the Maryland medical cannabis commission website is also a good spot very good Michael Brown find CEO here thanks for the time thanks for making us sort of look funny and appreciate it thank you for joining us for direct connection we're back Thursday with your money & business and I joined this Friday for state circle and a full wrap-up on the week's news from Annapolis please follow us on Twitter at MPT News Now for all of us at MPT thanks for watching and have a good night [Music] [Music] this program was made by MPT to serve all of our diverse communities", "hebvgdlyzYQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] good morning so I finally made it and I am now in drum roll made as a candidate I got here last night around like I want to say three four in the morning I would have blogged like me driving stuff but that's kind of boring and I would have did customs but customs is not name playing no games at that border she was not only I was some little friendly stuff she was not only and I pulled up somebody come on radio off I said he gets he'll be twice miss lady turned it off and she asked me five thousand questions literally questions I don't even understand why you need to know the answer to well how much money do you have on you why do you need to know that everything is just so nice here like it's just generally just nice the view is nice the Sun feels nice low you can see the Sun reflecting off my skin right now but I will say last night when I got here there was snow on the ground not like three inches of snow heavy snow but really I was driving around through some of the neighborhoods and stuff and they were powerless no yards full of snow and now I wake up this morning to sunnysean it and there are people downstairs swimming in the pool so our regions don't know how things work at Toronto it's clearly they just do it different here apparently you can snow one day and then you wake up and go swim in the next so hey I'm not gonna complain I'm gonna go put my swim trunks and I'm gonna go get in that pool later today but for now I'm just get my day started on the shower get dressed for today and then I'm gonna go explore some of the smoke shops because weed is legal in Canada so I'm gonna go see what's that's like I see if they got a gasser another thing I know gasps I'm gonna clown the whole store because you just cannot have a weed shop used to finish smelling rage now after that I'm gonna get some lunch or something and then I'll probably go I don't know today I'm in like a relaxing move so maybe I should go do some chilled stuff like our own little Museum or something go get a massage go spicy a little bit see what I can get myself into see if I can find a place to take pictures at and then after that I'll probably try to get some more food well let you see what we get let's just see where the day takes me I fell to the small shop that's my first mission smoke shops cuz I have to go see this is gas or not cause if it's not gas listen all right to get ready and we gonna air through the smoke shops okay so the hard part is now finished I got already did everything I had to do have my little pre-party turned up in my hotel room now the first stop is to go get lunch so I was looking online and the first thing God that popped up for like good food places he was plantain and it's supposed to be like this vegan place and I'm like have vegan have ice to eat chicken tenders whatever is not that it's not important but we're gonna try a plan to see if it's any good and then what you don't see what a day takes us hopefully Fanta is good because honestly I'm very hungry like very very hungry and I just don't have time for my foods to not be good because if my food is not good it's just gonna be a bad time all around for everybody involved all parties the waiter the manager the doorman the security guard at the parking lot everybody's gonna have a bad day if this food is bad but it is cross no bad vibes we gon expect this to be good let's hit the planter and dad so I just left plants on not too long ago the food is actually really good it fills you up really fast I wasn't able to finish my whole meal but I got the general gist of it and it was actually really good um I had an energizer shot the orange drink that was an energizer shot and it had like ginger in it that was actually to me nasty but it's only because I don't like ginger not because of anything else the lemonade was good fries are good they had some like dipping sauce I don't know what it was she said it was like dijon or something but I didn't hear what she said so now I am on my way to the smoke shop that is on the corner it's either this tree that I'm walking towards or the other Street but I'll figure that out after I start walking I guess I'm gonna go see what the smoke job is about hopefully they got good guess so that okay no you have seen but somebody will see what that's about hopefully I let me record in there if they don't then I'll try to like sneak a couple get a couple videos or something for ya everybody can see what's going on in the smoke shop because I'm curious as to how they do this here in how they I'm curious to how they go about the we stuff here too because it's legal here but it's not legal in the state so I'm wondering we don't see how they um how do you operate with the whole week [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I'm back from the smoke shop back in my hotel room and I got some food on the way to the smoke shop was crazy it's like a whole like personal shopper in it like somebody follows you around a store but I don't follow you but like you can go up to somebody and ask them like oh can I get some help and then they have like this little tablet thing where they walk around the store with you basically and tell you about each turn each other disposable pens the pre-rolls all type of stuff while you were on tell you about everything the name she rang you up on the thing and he goes at the front and check out they do ID you at the door though because I think in Canada you have to be 19 in order to buy legal marijuana but yeah that was super dope and then food was I just went to the bottom the floor level in my hotel and got a turkey burger from the little cafe down there but let me show you what I got from the hallway story so this is the bag it comes in I spent honestly I could not tell you how much I spend was in Canadian dollars and not a US so I don't know I spend a hundred twenty Canadian dollars it you know either convert that to us okay this is afraid it's already open don't don't only or nothing this is a disposable DAP in whoa there's disposable with THC pen it's tangerine dream innocence sativa him and it actually tastes just like oranges like its Lily just like oranges I don't really like it because I don't like oranges blood is what is the actual pin looks like it's already at the box because I was ripping it in a car I poured it like 20 times so there's that that was the disposable pan was 38 Canadian dollars again if you know how to convert it you got it okay this is the good supply Royal Highness pre-rolled blowing that's what it looks like it's not open yet because I didn't phone my readers need to bless yet that was 14 canadian dollars and as you can buy them one for you come bottom as singles or you can buy them in like some of them come in packs how about when it's a pack this is a single so it was one for one gram but then some of them say like five four five minutes which means that there's five blunts in there well five four one gram so it'll be five blunts in there at each dunno one gram this is an indica THC pyro blunt this is oh it's called Soleil oh this is there were new strands it's a reduced rate this is the one that grows only about its carbon new it's an indica and this is a female but it's 10 Canadian dollars and it's 14.5 so this is 0.5 Grambling also I'm not at telling nobody to smoke I'm not advocating nobody to go smoke out their smoke I'm just saying this is what I do she's known to get her money on me but I'm not very smart this is the houndstooth hybrid notice it's a sativa help sooth sativa one gram this is the actual flower here they call them flowers this is the actual like look you gotta roll up it you know this person got explaining this off this is the five things I was talking about so there's five pre-roll blessing here and there each one gram this is the the boss it's called the Boston Tea Party yeah and that is 31 Canadian dollars and these are it doesn't say but I'm trying to remember where I picked them up at in a store I want to say it's a sativa yeah it definitely is yes is this even yeah so that's pretty much I don't like to see what the rest of this stuff just all these products hitting like again I'm sure yeah that's pretty much it for today I just pick up tomorrow I started doing more stuff but let's taking the view one last time before a game for the day [Music] [Music]", "NAj7U_lcMiA": "we have these wild grapes growing all over in our backyard up here in northern Michigan and how do I know if these are safety or poisonous now let's take a closer look it's very important to do your research before eating any wild edible here we have grape vines they're growing right up along this Tamarack tree it looks like it goes almost 20 feet high now let's take a look at the leaves see its heart-shaped has these jagged edges that's the first good sign and these leaves are also edible and then you'll follow down to the end and you can see these tendrils their forked off that's what you want to see and tendrils are used for climbing up trees you'll see them help them wrap it on the branches now the Canadian moon sea grapes will look similar to the safe eating grapes but they're poisonous their leaves are smooth rather than being jagged and they also have only one seed in a grape and a seed is shaped like a crescent moon are sort of like a banana and when you break apart say feeding grape they'll have at least two or more seeds in it and they're teardrop shaped or shaped kind of like a pear so let's take a closer look at these as you know inside grapes our dark in color will break one off see we have inside there a broken apart and you see those two seeds inside they're teardrop shaped supposed to be a safe edible creep there now I feel confident so I'm gonna give one a test try it tastes sour you're supposed to harvest them are on the fall or after first freeze and then you got a sweeter taste but overall tastes good I remember to always do your research before trying any wild edible and now I'm gonna leave you with one of my favorite video clips when we went backpacking with adventure archives was some good information Oh ever thought of it poisoned myself I mean everything's edible just some of them are only out of one right and thanks for watching up trail 71", "3Mn2xa0bXgg": "[Music] [Music] well hello there guys girls non-binary people it's read here yet again people with us today as long as we got her box in the

the raspberry I think I was counting sherry but whatever if the raspberry filled donut is absolutely wonderful it's exceeded my expectations I will say this this is as close to perfection as you can

good size and I love how the raspberries all through the donut not just like in the middle as you can tell it's all through there and that's amazing that is a five star donor who would have thought people great value would put out something that good and fresh that's the freshest thing I've ever had Wow I'm not gonna go with our the freshness but you get what I'm saying the ex-wife was fresh before the BBC okay maybe way guys that's gonna be the official review as always thank you so much for watching we try to do it every day people 366 days a year another must buy check it out it might

reminds me of the first", "VpMpblAm-Nc": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "aLG8dlxPbls": "yes yes guys [ __ ] the [ __ ] Hanks and we have the chuckles as you can see I've been going on to make these for a little while these are the the 400 milligram Pat so peaked rings yes yes so if you

know what other people's experiences on with them - I mean I'm nailing with vegetables now obviously I do need a slightly higher dosage in mouth but I know also to take a little bit too much whew you can go the other way so you have got be careful [Music] sugaring the more advanced hearsay yeah too much so yeah to explain from last last night's live Bob snake we've got Lana here and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace wonder have a bomb and we'll all get along it's one of those I'll be back in roughly about an hour's time and I'll stick the camera on and I'll do another 10 15 minutes with a couple of thongs of snake oh my god I might not be able to smoke anything I don't really know that but we'll see from there yeah so cheers noise [Music] very tasty I did like them I do like Peter sweet son Peter sweets is the one that'll wake you up in the

love guys see you in an hour whoop-whoop", "kGoQovjQWZ8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about one of my favorite brands again we are talking about punch bar punch bar key lime pie this time I've reviewed I believe three punch bar products in the past I've liked them all they're an impressive little package this cost me $12 the dispensary know we're thinking $12 for something so small but as the name suggests it does hit hard and it tastes pretty good too or the ones I have had in the past have I've not had the key lime pie before but I am looking forward to it and hoping it is just as good as the punch bars we have reviewed here on wheats in the past so we opened up we can see a little chart there telling you different 25 milligram breakdowns but of course we're going to ignore that and eat the whole thing and if you've never tuned in to weights before and you don't know how this works what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open this up eat this bad boy or at least a portion of it here in front of the camera for ya and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so the key lime pie is white chocolate which is not my favorite kind of chocolate but you know could still be good has a slightly donor and a lime motor for short you can smell both weed and lime break it apart there ignore all those 25 milligram little break ups you can see it's fancy little printing there this little fist printed right into the chocolate pretty cool just give it a taste that's interesting um not my favorite thing I've tasted from punch bar but it definitely tastes like white chocolate with a hint of lime in it um it's good nobody like my chocolate I do like one so it's uh it's okay oh and there is I take it back there is some actual like a cookie crunch in there as well for the philip for the crust of the pie it's a little bit but you guys pretty much you're gonna know exactly how this tastes imagine white chocolate with a slight lime taste and a slight cookie crunch and also a slight weed taste that's the fudge bar uh uh just trying it here is not the most important part and the most important part is what happens in two hours from now which is when I'm gonna come back to you guys to let you know how we're feeling and hopefully it'll be just like the other punch bars in the past and it'll hit pretty hard and we'll be singing their praises so guys I will see you in two hours to let you know if this punch bar continues on with the positive legacy thanks for watching well we hit the two-hour mark guys and I am pleased to tell you that the punch bar key lime pie does not disappoint it's just a star strong as its brethren love it love punch bar the only problem is they're a little expensive at my dispensary this warrants 12 bucks which probably is a value for a lot of you but for my dispensary runs a little high but it is uh again such a little a nice package it's so small you know for a small thing you would expect you to have a heavy weed taste there is a weak taste it's not overpowering but it's easy to transport easy to get down and it really does hit hard it does so man this might be the last punch bar I do of the 225 milligram variety they have a whole bunch of flavors I don't think I need to do them all for you guys but I even more happy to have done the ones that I have done so far uh yeah so guys punch bar gets the highest seal of approval from us here at wheats thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or

gonna give you guys a full-on review of how they taste um do they taste like weed and all that [ __ ] good stuff um but it has 500 milligrams and i picked these up at a local dispensary and the local dispensary says that they get like basically most of the [ __ ] from la dink is that true not sure um but that was just a question that i wanted to [ __ ] um know but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] sit down and pop these open and then just give them a try but yeah let's just sit down alright guys we're currently sitting down now um it is currently 10 30 so i'm on i'm gonna be on some crackhead [

for each and every one of you guys um we're getting to the top i'm i ain't tripping on when it [ __ ] happens because i know it's gonna happen big i don't know when or how the [ __ ] is gonna happen but i know i'm gonna do this [ __ ] [ __ ] big um so we're just gonna [ __ ] keep going um i don't know what i'm gonna do for 1k but i'll i'll see if i end up doing anything but we're just gonna celebrate that [ __ ] honestly um i remember just calling that [ __ ] out and it just [ __ ] happened but back to the [ __ ] um it'll rebuke edible review i just wanted to [ __ ] talk to you guys and just say thank you to you guys real quick um but let's just pop this [ __ ] open oh [ __ ] i hate ripping [ __ ] all stupid um but now it's just early as [ __ ] and i'm eating candy and [ __ ] not even just candy [ __ ] edibles but and then they're sour as [ __ ] too well i'm guessing yourself but this is what they look like how many are in here so i got one two so i have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14. there's 14 little um um 14 little [ __ ] wow heads or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them um they don't look like the [ __ ] regular warheads um every other [ __ ] review that i've been trying like the [ __ ] sour patch ones the watermelon ones really look like the [ __ ] regular candy um this one doesn't look like the regular warheads but or what the [ __ ] do the regular warheads look like anyways actually doesn't matter but i'm just trying to give you guys as much detail as i [ __ ] can um it doesn't say how much [ __ ] thc is per little little um little gummy or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it but it says the packet says it's 500 um 500 milligrams so we're just gonna [ __ ] take these shits and see what's up i mean all of them all fourteen is it fourteen i don't know i'm probably sleeping one two three four five six oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] again one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve three four yeah fourteen um but yeah they're regular as [ __ ] jelly beans or they taste like regular jelly beans i don't taste any weed i was just one of them they're not that sour i was over scared as well i think i was young i was gonna be on camera soured out and [ __ ] looking like my guy right here and [ __ ] um but damn [ __ ] jelly bean flavors are these either like the best jelly beans shits are fire i got me doing my happy dancing [ __ ] i get so i get so excited every time like i'm [ __ ] eating candy and [ __ ] or even when i'm [ __ ] eating too and i'm enjoying that [ __ ] i started dancing them like yesterday i was at ihop [ __ ] in my ass i'll just eating and [ __ ] all that happy um [Music] you know what they taste like or this one or basically all them they taste like those one [ __ ] long sour ropes with like different colors and [ __ ] like blue it's not like different ropes that are different colors but they're like a [ __ ] rainbow i don't know what the [ __ ] they're called but it tastes like that little sour ropes one two three four five six seven eight i just ate half of these [ __ ] it's still earliest oh no it's early we'll take a shower right now um hopefully you should snack we're gonna see if they make me feel different um or if they don't i'ma just be honest i have no [ __ ] hate against any company if it doesn't smack then it just didn't smack this it's not saying that they don't have any anything that [ __ ] smacks but i'm gonna just let you guys know if it just didn't hit me or or what's up i'm not gonna lie to you guys either all right we got two left that's all of them i enjoyed myself eating them for five the taste i gotta give it a 10 out of ten honestly i give some [ __ ] ratings on here i can say i'm not attending [ __ ] but my [ __ ] opinion doesn't [ __ ] matter speak from your own experiences and just try them honestly what i'm trying to do is like see if like if you guys seen these in a local dispensary if you guys are thinking of trying them but you guys wanted to see someone's review first that's all i'm trying to do you know um i'm not telling you to try them i'm not telling you to go out and buy them right now i just want to give you guys more insight on these [ __ ] or if you guys ever like haven't heard of them and then you see this video and then you guys [ __ ] find out about them or find them and you're like oh [ __ ] they actually [ __ ] smack i want to try um that's all i wanted to do or um get out of this video my [ __ ] ratings don't mean [ __ ] everyone has their own [ __ ] ratings um but it's currently uh like 10 10 40 now or 10 yeah i think it's 10 40 because when i started recording it was like 10 35 and it's been like eight minutes so it's like 10 40 um i'll pick up the camera like around 11 50 or some [ __ ] or an hour from now and just let you guys know how i [ __ ] feel so hour by hour i'm going to be updating you guys um i don't know if it doesn't smack within like usually i get smacked within like the first hour two hours um but who knows the [ __ ] sour patch edibles took like four hours before they actually [ __ ] hit me and [ __ ] um so we're just gonna go with the flow and see what's up see if these are actually 500 milligrams or what's up but all right guys i'll pick up the camera later alright guys i currently just got out of the shower um you guys can see um dude i got a comment one time someone said that my [ __ ] perm looks goofy um it's not a perm i have natural curly hair it's just that sometimes it should just be looking goofy as [ __ ] because i have some thick ass [ __ ] girls and my hair just gets dried out sometimes um but i know i don't know i just wanted to mention that [ __ ] someone said i got a permanent [ __ ] it's not perm natural [ __ ] curls um but anyways it's currently like [ __ ] 12 [ __ ] 12 30 i think um i didn't pick it up within the first hour um but i'm just here to [ __ ] let you guys know i i don't know if i [ __ ] feel something or not um i want to wait a little bit more longer give it another hour or so but as of right now i just feel relaxed and i don't know it's just [ __ ] weird i'm not gonna say i'm smack smack but i'm also gonna say like i don't feel a little something it's not drastic but i can't say that i don't feel relaxed and i feel like i'm just chilling you know like i'm just vibing and [ __ ] um like if i had to rate it it's probably like a six six point five right now where i'm at i don't know um i'm feeling something chilling [ __ ] vibing um but i'm just give it another hour or so and see what the [ __ ] happens cuz right now uh i'm not feeling [ __ ] but yeah man we're just gonna [ __ ] let it run and i'll pick up the camera within another hour or so and see what's up i still haven't ate anything so we'll see all right guys as you guys can see i just made um my tea i got a maca and ashwagandha tea mixed with some with two tablespoons of honey um just to get that vitality up and that energy up um but that's just gonna be pretty much it it's currently 115 um 120 or some [ __ ] or some one something um but i i'm gonna rate those edibles on my personal scale 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't [ __ ] try them um but honestly i'm not gonna say that i didn't feel anything because i do feel like some haziness in my eyes and usually that's [ __ ] an indicator one like one of the indicators for me that i'm [ __ ] like high and [ __ ] but like i feel hazy in my eyes my eyes feel like low-key kind of [ __ ] heavy but nothing major you know i'm [ __ ] chilling i'm rocking um i would suggest some more if you have a a lower tolerance um and then and if you have a lower tolerance and it may [ __ ] hit you a lot more harder um but it wasn't nothing crazy for me it was just i was just chilling um but it's cool trying out these different [ __ ] like candy um replicated edibles or whatever how however you would wear that um it's just cool to try out like [ __ ] like a wonka bar [ __ ] sour patch [ __ ] flavored ones warheads it's [ __ ] crazy uh mixed with weed that's crazy as [ __ ] that's just dope um but yeah just because i give it a 6.5 doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you have a lower tolerance or an a [ __ ] tolerance then go for it give them a try they're [ __ ] the taste of them is fired um i'm pretty sure it will [ __ ] smack if i like gave it to my sisters or some [ __ ] um but yeah i'ma just go ahead and end the video here man um if you guys enjoyed this video hit that subscribe button also hit that bell notification she doesn't get notified when i drop more gems more bangers all my videos are gems they're only getting better and better so if you don't [ __ ] with them now trust me they're only getting better and better we're just i'm

but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I

press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "bSSkETjt8KE":

blows it to me I felt so freaking guilty anyway when you're in the waiting room they have a big board up TV screen that tells you all everything that's available in the price and that was really helpful especially when I was panicking so we could decide what we wanted fast and get in and out and these people were so kind and helpful like I was obviously panicked like because I had to be somewhere and so we told her what we wanted and she went back and got it all ready for us so when we finally finished processing our paperwork we were able to run back there grab the stuff and then like be mesmerized because there's all this stuff to look at they had like a little glass display cases where you can look at things and all this glass work to look at and I don't even know what else because I was like both focused but like I wanted to spend time there like I wanted to go there and spend an hour looking at everything they had and I felt good it felt like a really good beautiful place to hang out and be educated and talk about what they have also I wanted to tell you they told us that on weed maps is automatically linked to their inventory so you could see exactly what they do have at that time before you go and let's see let's get to the hole oh my god okay so this is Blue Dream by Liberty harmony it says how many liberties here you go it's just THC it is raved about

all right and it's a 500 milligrams in this bottle and I think it's like six seven for a dropper home or milliliter it's not really much of a home video if I don't show you what's inside so let's look inside for him so inside you have a Liberty in a black ball anyway breeze it's all proof as always everything is freakin childproof really crazy and you pick it up and this let's get some and it's a pale yellow there you go and it smells like alcohol hey that's what we got so there's number one second thing that we had to go for a cartridge a lemonhead cartridge here you go but look at it alright

someone ahead oh I can smell it yes it's been used alright so it is a nice beautiful like it really looks like a lemony color doesn't it lemony and that was the lemonhead cartridge and that is good for pain and I think it was a cush and I wish I knew more I wish I could give you a description of more about it but I can't sorry I can do what I can do but I do have a sec I have a back onion uh

breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know

wonderful um pretty warm i'm kind of getting hot in my slacks uh but today i have the uh funk factory gutseria hope i'm saying that right and this is their framsvart framswart a spontaneous beer aged on black raspberries big old bottle got a ton to say about this one first of all i think it's the perfect day for a spontaneously fermented beer aged on black raspberries now what does that even mean well i had to do some research on this one this is a very interesting i learned a lot in a short time here so this is basically a um a lambic beer but lambic is a style a kind of a a a wild what's the word spontaneous you know in other words the it's fermented in the open and so bacteria or whatever it is in the air around you enters the fermentation and gives it a i guess a funky tart taste now uh lambic is a style that comes from belgium and they're very i guess possessive of that style it's done in a very specific way and uh you know they created it so this is a brood in america and um there's kind of some conflict i guess because the belgian brewers uh who've been around forever don't want us absconding with their lambic uh name kind of like champagne from france you know it means a specific region so instead they are i guess these brewers are taking to calling this the method traditional traditional a traditional method i guess that probably belgian for traditional method i'm just guessing and uh that means holy crap that means a lambic uh no no okay i won't let that keep happening i promise sorry about that um so it's windy so this thing six percent abv uh and i'm opening it up early afternoon i'm gonna have it with lunch and um to kind of sip it throughout the day is my plan but it's just i feel like it's the perfect picnic beer now i haven't tasted it yet i'm hoping i'm right about that but i've always sort of associated these tart berry beers good for um warm weather eating food sharing with friends so in more interesting stuff about so much interesting stuff i learned a little bit more about this beer first it's uh it's uh i'll just read the back it's a vintage 2018 so it's actually a couple years old now um it's 20 few years old what the heck it's 2021 right now hopefully this thing hasn't gone completely bad but it says um franzwort is our spontaneously fermented beer adhering to the method traditional standard uh it was aged for 18 to 30 months in french oak barrels and then re-fermented on two pounds per gallon of black raspberries for three months you know what that i bet what that means is it was it's been aging since 2018 because i don't i haven't had this i've had this bottle for like three or four months in my fridge but um i don't think i think what happened is probably brewed in 2018 aged for let's say about two years probably came out mid 2020 and i picked it up probably late 2020 or something like that and it's now kind of almost it's basically spring 2021 so uh very interesting it's got a lot of stuff i love right i love raspberries i love sours i love lambics i love barrel age stuff aged for a long time two years or so in french oak barrels six percent abv that's also interesting because you sort of a lot of times expect a barrel a beer that's been aged in barrels that long to be a higher abv at that point and i'm i'm happy i don't i don't want to knock out uh boozy day today i just want to taste this thing now another thing i learned funk factory well that's kind of an interesting play on words because i assumed that only had to do with the spontaneous you know the bacteria the funk from that but the guy the founder's name is something funk his last name is funk uh and another crazy thing i was astonished i'm still not sure i want to confirm this but apparently that dude is also the founder of untitled art uh the other you know uh beer company and so kind of crazy what's this dude up to man he's an economist his main job as an economist and he's founded i guess two uh beer uh you know companies or whatever so that's pretty mind-boggling i also want to recommend an article if you want to learn more about this i got my laptop over here i'll put a link in the description but it's called uh don't call it a sour don't call it a sour at goodbeerhunting.com so that was a very very very interesting article well written tons of cool info uh pretty lengthy substantial article and it has some great photos of this uh the place where this place the brewery uh looks awesome kind of a warehouse style space and uh they're located by the way in is it wisconsin yeah madison in madison wisconsin so um anyway just all sorts of interesting stuff i learned in a short time about this company and uh i guess with all that being said it's about time to crack it open i'm excited uh it again it looks like a picnic beer to me all the way down to this cool thingamajiggy that i'll probably struggle to open but i'm going to try anyway hopefully i can do it by hand uh as always once i pour it i will run to take a picture for my instagram which is at craft christian reviews i want you to go find me over there at craft christian reviews then i'll come back and do the um smelling and tasting and showing it off and stuff now i'm a little bit worried because i accidentally bumped it and i'm afraid it's gonna be very very fizzy so stand back all right i'm gonna make a fool of myself oh god there we go ye okay it's kind of going no it's not too bad all right i'm gonna pour it take a picture and be right back for the review that's beautiful beautiful yes sir wow can smell the raspberries okay be right back all right well i got my picture uh the only thing i regret is that the head just vanishes so quickly i still see carbonation streaming up in there it's not like it's a flat it's not flat it's just the head just poof it's gone which is too bad cause it's real pretty you guys probably saw on the video uh anyway go find the instagram post to get closer look at this um yeah i can just smell the tart almost makes my mouth water tart blackberries the color is just luscious uh wine looks like a wine with a little bit of carbonation um i don't know i don't know if you if you know the smell you're familiar with it it's the smell of a sour tart wild sort of beer so let's give it a taste okay very nice very nice um very very juicy very very very flavorful not very bitter quite tart quite almost puckeringly sour you can definitely tell the oak barrel agent you can notice that right off um it's almost like drinking a wine it's like some cross between a sour wine and and a fruit drink or something um you know i think that's not gonna be up everyone's alley some people don't like that kind of stuff personally i love it um it's sour whoa i love sour stuff it's very tart and it kind of rushes across your whole mouth um yeah i mean it's almost like uh this is one of the most sour beers i've i've had it's just straight up sour um and uh anyway look it's got it's got complexity it's a sipper uh not because it's so strong but because the tarteness is so profound that no one is going to be slugging back huge um huge uh gulps of this i don't think very very nice i don't think it's too old at all it's not a beer that needs to be excuse me i don't think freshness is that it's not like a hoppy ipa or something where freshness itself is is a quality um that you're seeking out i think this one is one that can age for a while and i don't actually have a cellar i just have my fridge and like i said i still don't know exactly when this thing was bottled or brewed but i can tell you this is delicious uh this this brewer clearly knows what he's doing and i'm going to enjoy sipping this on this picnic style day while my food while i'm eating my food so if you like this kind of content uh give me a like a subscribe and comment uh all that stuff helps me immensely means a lot to me go find me on instagram craft christian reviews follow me over there and again i'm going to put a link in the uh description to the article i read don't call it a sour which if you have any interest in this video i've just made i think you'll find that article fascinating i hope you go and read it go check out this brewery and of course um i love untitled art as well they've got a bunch of great stuff so uh until next time hope you enjoy whatever you're drinking and uh

"ciNMbLUS_0k": "what's up guys my name is Shana we're back again so today I have a treat for you see what I did there ok so this stuff right here is supposed to be the granddaddy of desert babes this is a vanilla bean ice-cream sandwich between two Fruity Pebbles cereal rice krispies treat things right there this is a big mother bottle of juice right here this bad boy is huge I mean look at that thing it's messes the biggest bottle of juice I think I've ever had even the drip top thing goes all the way down it's absolutely a behemoth when I received this guy it came in this box right here look at that how awesome is that it's like a big wrapped up piece of candy and you got that nice logo on it right there it looks amazing that's actually maybe you want to buy this bottle of juice if you guys haven't seen the promotion for this thing check it out right here so I pretty much saw that thing and I was like oh my god I need to have this like in my life right now okay so inside the actual packaging right here came with a big bag with the juice in it right here as well as a separate unicorn bottle so you don't have to walk around with this big-ass behemoth in your pocket right here haven't really use this bad boy yet I assume it just works like any other drip cap but it does have a also a treats logo on it it didn't just come with a plain generic one right there the marketing for this thing is in full swing it is some really hyped up juice right now the low going is very minimalistic looks really good such treats it looks like a 1980s hotline Miami neon style stuff going on here two three milligrams of nicotine in this manner JAMA and Max VG so really really good drip juice right here so for getting further I've actually never had vanilla ice cream and fruity pebbles meshed together as an ice cream sandwich so we're gonna solve that problem right now okay so what I have right here is a vanilla rice krispies treat homemade smash between some vanilla bean ice cream we're gonna go ahead and try this manage a minute then we're gonna compare it to the juice we go ahead and actually do the review on it oh wow yeah I'll prove huh tastes like diabetes okay so now that I've experienced that I know what to expect hopping right on into this bottle right here so we're gonna go ahead and open this bad boy up and start the smell test on it okay so this stuff right here legit smells like some fruity pebble ice cream with a heavy sense of cream coming out of the smell of it it could vape completely different so I have it all loaded up right here an MVP 3.0 Pro Edition tugboat RDA brand-new dual coil build new cotton new everything is loaded up run at 60 watts it's ready to go this is treats buy treats I think hmm it's mixing real well with the treat that I just ate okay so like usual the lemon is very dominant inside this cereal babe however I am tasting the vanilla ice cream a little bit very very cloudy juice it's not so much like a looper it legit tastes like an original juice it's not the greatest thing in the world and if for damn sure does not taste like what I just ate I just think it's a little overhyped I mean the presentation is absolutely amazing with that being said though I do however think it's a really good cereal juice I am getting the vanilla ice cream but it doesn't really taste like an ice cream it tastes more like a standard vanilla mix with some fruity pebbles it has a very distinct amount of cream to it kind of like a fruity pebbles milkshake does that make sense that's kind of what I'm getting out of this like a fruity pebbles vanilla milkshake now the cereal is not as lemony as some other juices out there the lemons is still very dominant inside treats I think with the extra cream and the hint of vanilla to it it actually holds its own do I think it's worth 50 bucks no I do not however it does only come in 120 milliliters so if you guys do want to try yourself dropping 250 bucks on maybe you guys can pitch in with some friends and you guys can all take like 30 mils out of it or something like that and just kind of share the bottle pass it around do that sort of thing and if you like it then go ahead and spend the extra 50 bucks and get yourself your own personal Boheme a--the right here I do think it's a little overhyped however it's still a solid cereal juice it's not a bad juice by any means I do wish it had more of like a marshmallowy taste to it versus like a creaminess sample it out a little bit because it is an investment this is a $50 bottle of ejuice right here now you do get a lot of a juice however if you don't like it you're stuck with a behemoth of a juice that you're not probably not going to use and you're probably gonna give away to your friends I however thoroughly enjoy it I think it's a pretty good juice I'm giving it a solid two thumbs up just because it does kind of hold its own in the cereal market and the presentation is amazing the juice is a it's definitely a top not a juice I like max VG juices so one of my favorite cereal juices on the market right now is kilos cereal milk and I still prefer kilos cereal milk over treats right here now I do have the juice and I'm gonna let this steep for a little bit longer and it's probably going to grow on me a lot more bottom line though it's a solid juice if you guys want to make the investment on it I'll put the link right down to description as far as being overhyped I really don't have anything bad to say about it it's still a pretty good juice and I will gladly recommend it and that's about it anyway guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and stay tuned for another one hi", "UosMa2FrQHI": "yo what is up guys it is your boy anthony and

left i don't know it tastes like regular milk chocolate i couldn't taste the weird but not a lot so i guess that's a plus too i don't know if people like to taste it whoa that's because she's connected to the bluetooth um i got scared but all these noises coming out of nowhere but i don't know if it's a plus to not taste the weed or to taste the weed but i'm gonna eat the whole thing [ __

we're talking about some [ __ ] and like it was like a little mini argument but it wasn't an argument it was like some on some funny [ __ ] and i was laughing and laughing dude and i couldn't tell if it was because it was just so funny to me or if it was because of the edibles it was not funny but it was hilarious um and i didn't even realize my eyes were this low it's at six o'clock now and so it's been an hour since i took them but i'm gonna just keep updating you guys more and more and see what's up with it um i'll pick it up like around 7 30 or i just feel like [ __ ] laughing now dude but we were just in a in target for a long ass time but yeah we'll pick it up later alright guys it's currently seven o'clock and it's a cool high it's a cool like edibles don't i never really had any smack but the ones i [ __ ] tried before and this is another one i'll add it to my [ __ ] list i'll give this one a [ __ ] 9.5 just because i [ __ ] with the high it's like a cool ass chill ass high you know it's not like that [ __ ] smack smack that i was [ __ ] thinking or expecting but it's like a cool last [ __ ] high you know i got the giggles out of it i got the laughs out of it um but yeah now we're just in the [ __ ] chill eat some pizza watch some tv and just [ __ ] chill i'll see what happens at eight um and yeah i'll just update you guys along but this shit's a [ __ ] vibe it's a cool ass edible the wonka bar it's a it's a golden ticket in itself man um but i'm just being pretty good all right guys it is 10 41. um i think i last picked up the camera like that seven or eight i think i don't know when was the last time i talked on camera but it's currently 10 41 man and i just did like a fat ass nap um i think i rated the [ __ ] edibles and eight just because i don't like chocolate but the [ __ ] were fired and i sure was a dope ass high i should smack man that should be this bad um [Music] in the beginning it's like a cool ass like brush you know you get to laugh you get the giggles you're just chilling you're vibing and then once you just like start settling down you just relax dude you know you just calm down you just i think a fat ass nap dude i just [ __ ] knocked out feel good now i feel relaxed i'm calm chilling um but that edible was [ __ ] fire not even a lot i should really did smack all right guys it is currently the next day and i just wanted to pick up the camera i was just showing you editing the video and i wanted to give you guys a little bit more i wanted to give you guys a little bit more insight on to how much the [ __ ] wonka bar is smacked now that i'm sober and clear now that i can talk to you guys right and [ __ ] clear minded but yesterday i did not smoke all i had weed wise was that wonka bar and i was [ __ ] vibing and satisfied that wonka bar satisfied me throughout the whole day i did not want to smoke nor did i need a smoke i was just gone the whole day um so just to give you guys a little run down throughout the day i took the [ __ ] edibles at five o'clock and after taking the edibles we went to the store and that was like an hour and 30 minutes in and by then i was already feeling something um but it wasn't like an uncomfortable feeling i was i was vibing i was laughing it up i was just laughing it up chopping it up honestly like i just was laughing at nothing and felt like laughing at nothing um and three hours into the edible that's when i was really really feeling it in my head and i was just like [ __ ] i'm so blown and you guys seen my face at 10 41 when i picked up the camera on the last clip i was ready for bed i was so gone um i was just so blown i was ready to knock the [ __ ] out and literally that's what i did after that after picking up the camera and i hadn't slept that comfortable in it in a minute let me just tell you that edible had me out like a [ __ ] light um but i slept like a baby last night and i don't know if this is just me but me personally i don't realize how high i actually was until the next morning i obviously recognized that i'm high in the moment but the next morning i woke like this morning there was this morning this morning i woke up and i was just [ __ ] gone dude i felt so groggy and lagged um but it was nothing bad you know um i love being relaxed me personally i'm a relaxed person so it was just a good feeling for me you know i was just calm i took a fire ass shower and i was just now i'm just vibing dude um but yeah i know i gave the edible a 9.5 but that's just used to give an understanding of how [ __ ] dink it is but that was just my opinion go try it out for yourself or if you guys have tried it out already let me know down below um but literally i was satisfied with that [ __ ] wonka bar throughout the day and i hadn't had any [ __ ] edibles smack that [ __ ] hard you know that's gonna the wonka bar is on top of my list and then it's the um stoner patch edibles that are second on my list um but i'm gonna just

and the berries that we make some of our compounds out of.  Here is a plant in front of us that is known in Central America by the Spanish speaking Indian they call the Sauco, is a plant that in the berries we find that the mineral of iron is found, iron phosphate iron phosphate is found in these berries and these berries are responsible for us reversing a lot of diseases that sits in the blood they contain iron phosphate. This plant the Sauco when it sends its roots into the ground it converts that oxide mineral into a liquid digestible substance, known,  the process is known as iontopherosis or the conversion from a solid to a liquid and here Mother Nature has converted iron which is solid into a berry for you to enjoy. And over here we find now that the flower, unlike the berries that contain iron phosphate the flower now is a different chemistry here we have potassium phosphate when the children here in Central America has fever rest assured that the mother would come here and ask me to give them some of the flower of the Sauco to remove the fever because it means that inflammation is sitting some place in the body and this is extremely effective because of its high content of iron and potassium phosphate the SAUCO  ", "Xm5vD98KKQU": "Welcome to Rosie's Tea Party Show. Today we're going to do sugar coated grapes. This recipe is really easy for kids. First we need purple grapes. You can use green grapes but it looks prettier with purple. You'll need two kinds of sugars.  The crystals and the granules. These are the crystals.  They're bigger.  You \n can get these at the bulk food barn. Or where ever they sell things to decorate cakes. These are sugar granules.  This is the \n sugar that most people use for baking. There are two ways to make the sugar stick to the grapes. One way is with egg white. The other way with apple juice. Some people don't want to eat raw egg white. That's why I'm going to show you how to do it with apple juice. First I'm going to show you how to do it with egg white. This part you might need a big person to help. My cousin Guppy is here to help. Hi Guppy.\nHi Rosie. I need some egg white.  Can you help me?\nSure. You hit the egg on the side of the bowl. When you get a crack, you put your \n fingers in and pull the shell apart. Perfect! You get the white part and the yolk. This isn't exactly white but they call it white. The white part is what we need.  We don't need the yellow part. So we need to separate these two Guppy is going to help me separate them. I'm going to use a spoon that has holes in it. You have to be very careful not to break the yolk... or else it won't come out as easy. You want to let the white part drip off. We don't need the egg yolk so let's put it in here. Pour the egg white in the big bowl. CLUNK! \nOoops!  You're not suppose to put the bowl in too. Take a bunch of grapes... dip it in the egg white... and then... put it in the crystals Don't they look pretty? Now we're going to show you how to do it with apple juice. Pour some juice in a bowl... We're going to use the green grapes this time. We're going to dip it in the granule sugar. Make sure you get it well coated like this. They look so yummy! These grapes will be perfect for our tea parties. That's it for sugar coated grapes.  Bye for now. Hey!  That's for the tea party!  Stop eating them all! Ay. Yummy!", "l13SfeCm65c": "okay everybody so I have a bag here that I found I met with the owners last night and they actually played a little trick on me and it worked so I'm actually gonna do a live demonstration with somebody a complete stranger they don't know they've never seen this product before but they brought up a problem and I had a solution for them which is this and I'm gonna show their hands in this video and they're gonna try to try to figure this thing out okay so this is the e pack I think that's a company name but it's basically it's a childproof bag okay so here it goes alright opening I think I would name sensory remember this is a complete stranger this is not this is not a setup okay okay I'm gonna give you some more time anything you want except scissors okay I wouldn't do that all right can you try it okay hold this camera like this like that all right so it's a child it's a child safety lock there you can try that right there bring it down okay all right can we turn this thing around no okay so here it goes okay it's child lock you got a pull back that's how it opens okay so you pulled the back with the lever with the front gear now I think that was like kind of a kind of a genius idea you know I was on the show like these like yeah this is childproof like how did you make a bad child loop and I'm like I literally couldn't open it and it just went pow and I was like oh my god is this so amazing so there you go but this year we'll actually see oh that the odor in and then it's child proof at the same time up to maybe like age 13 depending on the IQ level I think Oh anyway I don't know this will solve your problem right there you can have that just take it home and play with it now you actually got a bet you got something you were just gnarling I think we're ready to pull your own hair yeah so yeah I think it's it's a pretty neat product it's kind of smart yeah so it's back and in the front pull it from I'll give you guys I have more detailed demonstration actually here to be sure maybe you might not be able to see it so she actually tried to bite on this thing and you can tell so anyways um normally bags are open up right in the front here but you can't open it so obviously an average kid may not figure it out but you know depending on their IQ level so you have to pull the back here okay with the front and then it opens up that way and you reach back into the front here okay so there you guys have it this is a EEP AK flexible packaging made in USA thanks guys hope you guys enjoyed this video", "MEWxcrW3GC4": "all

from Flemington markets the wholesale fruit and vegetable markets in Sydney and I found my very favorite fruit there which is only around for a really short season in Sydney they're really very small the diameter is about half a centimeter to zero point seven centimetres across and their little flavour busts of sweetness they look a little bit like the currents that are pictured on the right bina bottle so you could eat them very daintily one by one but a that would take you ages to finish and be there's not enough of the flavor to go around so what the man at the stall taught me to do is to just peel off little bunches like this and you can put it all in your mouth and pull out the thicker stock the really small stocks that are very fine can be eaten this is a fruit that my entire family enjoys because it's really really sweet and no scientific basis on my part but I'm sure it is full of vitamin C", "sYzpvzlUMDA": "[Music] sup everybody sweet head that's some sunset sherbert you have

grapes are easily my personal favorite from the grapery so far now we've had four varieties we've tasted on camera and i like these ones a lot now you can see there's a slightly undeveloped seed there but you can't feel the texture when you eat it wow in other words if you didn't cut it open you wouldn't know it was there but you can see it oh man that's about the only negative thing i could think of for these grapes they're absolutely amazing beautiful kind of a they look different on online these are more red where the ones online look a bit more purple but taste wise gumdrops are my favorite the easily drops are good too hopefully you've seen our video on that but i prefer if i had to choose one it would definitely be the gum drops wow let's get the show on the road and let's brix one of these grapes here i'll go for this one i'm gonna predict that it's higher than those moon drops which breaks slightly under 20. so let's see what this one does oh man they taste so sweet i like candy and it's a solid 24 on the brick scale which is very high very sweet that's what i thought man easily my favorite grapes that i've ever had that are growing in california probably i would have to say that this is a 10 out of 10. and i'm gonna have to say this is my favorite grape i've ever eaten so i hope you can find them i found these at sprouts and i've also seen them at home depot or not home depot sorry trader joe's in southern california i just went to home depot so there you go all right give us a like and a subscribe and thanks for watching i hope you can get some of these gum drop

"Ha8Eej6E7i8": "hey guys and welcome back to the channel today on this redline vlog style video i've got the newest member of the volkswagen suv family that's right that is the 2020 volkswagen atlas cross sport now the last time i drove this thing i was in vancouver it was about earlier this year right before the pandemic started as you can see this is an sel with the r line sport appearance package designed to be a competitor to things like the ford edge a jeep grand cherokee a honda passport the upcoming toyota venza it essentially takes the very successful 303 row atlas and shortens it creating a two-row version and kind of gives it a cupified look to kind of make it resemble like an audi q8 or a lamborghini earth so the big question i want to answer is the new atlas cross sport the perfect family vehicle for today's modern family that's over here to find out [Music] so just like the regular three row atlas the cross sport has the newer front fascia which actually volkswagen just put this new fascia on the 2021 atlas so stay tuned for my full review on that video called a later date but as you can see compared to the last one that i drove in vancouver which was a boring silver color this is a very pretty shade of kind of like a greenish blue tint this is the sel with the r line package it's not the full sel premium but you get full led headlights no led fog lights instead you kind of have this sculpted front fascia with a deeper uh blacked out painted lower air dam and you get more of that chrome trim this kind of very subtle r-line badge and this is a very big vehicle remember it goes head-to-head with cars like the honda passport the ford edge the chevrolet blazer and compared to the regular atlas this is about three inches shorter but at 195 inches long overall this is still on the bigger end it's about five inches longer than something like the honda passport now because this one has the r-line sport package you get these 21 inch wheels wrapped in two 65 with tires these are one of the largest wheels that you can get in the industry and just like the regular atlas you still get a fairly decent amount of ground clearance around eight inches total and it shares the same 117 inch long wheelbase obviously when you get back here you can see it's got that sloping coupe like look kind of reminds you of an audi q8 or a porsche cayenne coupe which is also a really stylish looking vehicle now the tail light modules just like the regular atlas are kind of an led combination but they do look slightly different this is the most differentiating angle between this and the regular atlas you have these fake chrome exhaust trim pieces vw and audi have been very guilty of that as well this particular one here also has the towing package which can tell a maximum of 5000 pounds and because it's an suv the trunk capacity is huge you can see with the seats up which this doesn't offer a third row my dog cedar happily kind of jumped right in you get 40.1 cubic feet of space and if you fold down everything you get around 78 cubic feet of space and you also get a very happy puppy now of course on the inside of the atlas cross sport if you guys are pretty familiar with the atlas interior and a lot of other newer volkswagen interiors it's going to look very familiar now first things first as you can see this is the sel with the r-line package it's got this really nice tan interior with the two-tone the seats are just heated if you want cooled seats you have to go for the sel premium which my tester is one notch below it shutting the door it has a relatively solid thunk that you associate with other german cars and this interior at a glance looks fairly nice however if i'm going to be honest here vw really needs to do something about the design of their interiors they just don't really have that wow factor that they used to have a few years ago i mean sure you've got the digital cockpit display over here which is very close to what you find in a lot of audis with their virtual cockpit you have an eight inch touchscreen over here that includes things like android auto and apple carplay it is a very nice easy to use system the screen is bright although i think that at eight inches it's starting to look a little bit small especially considering how expansive and large the dashboard is of this vehicle the materials here have some of that faux stitching with the leatherette there on the upper portion here the door panel here is also a soft touch injection molded plastic you've got some silver painted plastic and some imitation plastic which tries to look like carbon fiber the door handle here is metal at least and it's also slightly padded over here the window controls are one touch up and down for all four so that's all very nice stuff in here really the newest thing that you're gonna notice in the interior is this steering wheel it's the new volkswagen steering wheel with the new volkswagen emblem it definitely looks a lot slimmer a lot more modern it looks a little bit more luxury oriented as well i really like the emblem this is what you're going to start seeing trickle down into other volkswagen products the steering wheel itself tilts and telescopes offers a lot of adjustability and range which is very nice and then over here you can see the dashboard layout design is pretty similar to every other volkswagen that i've seen and i kind of think that's where vw could have done more to differentiate this car from other vehicles i like this little shelf over here where you can store stuff you've got dual zone climate control just heated seats no cooled seats on this particular one here there's a couple of empty buttons over there and then over here down here you can see there is a wireless phone charger two usb ports and then lots of controls over here for your drive mode selector this controls the eight speed automatic which by the way because i don't have the premium package i only have just a standard backup camera if you guys go for the sel premium package um you'll get the full 360 camera with the top down views your cup holders over here electronic parking brake and then of course nice big center core storage over here with a nice padded lid the lid itself however doesn't slide forward and back that's always typically been a volkswagen thing so that's weird to see it missing here the seats are also a little bit boring to look at but i do like the color i wish they were cooled on this trim but you got to step up one more notch and then they feel relatively good this is not a real leather this is the synthetic leather leather that volkswagen offers on the lower trims the premium package gives you a real leather and then the glove compartment here you can see there's two us sd card slots there for the gps it's not lined with felt but it is damped and then above me you can see panoramic roof is included on this trim which lets in a lot of light the back seats as you can see are huge let me show you guys that real quick and as you can see the back seat of the cross sport is actually larger versus the three row atlas because volkswagen said when they took out the third row in this vehicle they were able to kind of push the second row a little bit further back to give passengers more space vw says you get around 40 inches of legroom back here 40 inches and you have a nearly completely flat floor surprise there's actually a little shelf here where there should be something here maybe for like your climate control settings in other parts of the of the world two usb ports over there a household power outlet and then when you shut the door you can see it sounds pretty similar to the front this is a hard touch plastic material here on the upper door panels of the rear door so a little bit of cost cutting there two map pockets which is nice the seats themselves you can see they don't actually slide forward and back which would have been nice but they do offer a little bit of adjustability so you can kind of fold them forward or you can also recline them slightly which is good but i'm surprised that vw didn't allow me to actually slide the seat forward which would have been nice to uh to include on the two-row version so overall if you're looking for one of the largest back scenes in the segment the atlas cross sport definitely will satisfy that and really this is about as big as what you're going to find in the honda passport so the atlas cross sport is volkswagen's entry into the continuously growing two-row mid-size crossover second remember this is a segment for vehicle for people who think that the compact crossover like a tiguan or a rav4 or crv is too small because you want something with more space in the second row and the trunk and you potentially want a six cylinder engine most vehicles a lot of entries in this segment have a six cylinder a v6 or vr6 like this one and honestly when i first drove this car back in british columbia when i was in vancouver i was pretty impressed with it it's a relatively solid entry in the segment it's not the sportiest it's not the most luxurious it's not the sleekest looking but it covers a very nice middle ground volkswagen has priced it well and it also looks relatively handsome on the outside now the one that i tested in vancouver was a very boring silver with black interior but this one here in tourmaline blue with this beige interior combination is really nice this is how i would i would buy this car if i was going to look at one of these and the outside like i said um for 2021 vw is adjusting the regular atlas to have the same front fascia as this but unlike you know the passport and the pilot which have basically just a different grille and slightly different tail lights they look like exactly the same vehicle this however looks you know slightly more different to me i also think that the vw did a good job with the proportions of the rear even though i hate this sloping coupe design i think this particular one looks good at the back now regarding the interior vw has been heavily criticized by consumers and myself for being a little bit too safe on the interior and the cross sport is technically no exception to that rule either so the inside may not be super luxurious or full of all the latest tech it doesn't really wow you but it is comfortable it's easy to use it's also very quiet in here and this car has a really good ride quality despite the fact that it's on 21-inch wheels now a 2-liter turbo engine is the standard engine in the cross sport i actually haven't driven the 2-liter turbo i would probably skip it just because i don't like that engine in the tiguan but it is tuned to make 235 horsepower in this most people who buy a cross sport will probably go for the vr6 and this is vw's 3.6 liter unit with 276 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque it goes out through an 8-speed automatic transmission this one has their hall decks based four motion all-wheel drive system and when you put the vehicle into its sport setting here and put your foot down this definitely has the grunt that i'm expecting for a vehicle that's in the midsize crossover segment i mean the tiguan um which is pretty big for a compact car is just ridiculously sluggish with the two liter this 3.6 has a very nice snarl to it it's very smooth it's very refined it's not the quickest in the segment cars like the honda passport will be faster the subaru outback turbo will be faster the chevrolet blazer with its 3.6 is faster this feels pretty comparable to the last grand cherokee with the 3.6 liter pentastar engine that i drove i also like this has a traditional stepped automatic so for those of you who hate cvts this is going to be a really nice option for you it feels like it gets to 60 in the mid 7 second range which is adequate performance um it's got plenty of power for most people i actually thought it felt underpowered when i was in vancouver now that i have the car back at home at sea level where it's not we're not at elevation i find the power to be adequate um do i wish it had a little bit more power sure do i wish that the crossbar was a little sportier to drive sure absolutely i mean this car feels big and heavy it's very wide you really notice the width of this car which translates to a lot of interior space in the front you know between the two passengers at the back or the front here it's a very smooth refined car but there's a reason obviously why you know the audi q8 gets the turbocharged v6 because it has way more low end torque it feels a little bit more effortless this engine you know you kind of have to rev it out to feel a little bit of power but it's a good engine that you want to rev out that you know is very smooth and quiet so i don't really have a problem doing that the 8-speed automatic in this car also is very smooth it shifts perfectly fine it's very competitive with the segment it's not you know one of the best transmissions in the business but it's a transmission that will just kind of you know fade and fade into the background as you drive this thing daily so i think that's really important uh when you're talking about a daily driver really the cross sport is so middle of the road just good at everything that i have trouble finding faults with this thing i mean sure i could complain about it being boring on uh to drive i can complain about the interior not having that wow factor but really volkswagen knows you know their target audience with this thing and for the people who are looking for a family car that has way more space than most of the competition this is going to do very nicely in that regard now if you guys were planning to actually tow use that 5000 pound towing capacity i would be concerned that this v6 doesn't quite have the grunt but like i said for most everyday usages you get it up to highway speeds it has a very soft controlled ride quality it's very quiet in here this would be a really excellent road trip car just from the sheer amount of space that it has really where i think vw needs to work on is the fuel efficiency for this engine it is rated at 16 in the city and 22 on the highway which in my week's worth of testing i have been averaging around 17 mpg which is not great um on the highway i did get this up to about 23 mpg so it will do a little bit better than the actual epa numbers which seems a little bit conservative to me but you know with the turbocharged engines that everyone's going to in the competition set vw does need to work on the fuel economy and make this thing better it is a product of the fact that this is a heavy car this weighs you know a little over 4 500 pounds so it is pretty heavy and it feels heavy when you're driving it but that heft translates into you know feeling of safety a feeling of quality so i think there's a reason why uh vw did that so overall if you like the way the atlas drives this drives the same way it doesn't feel any smaller to me or any sportier but it's just as every bit as comfortable it's just as quiet it's every bit as smooth and it's also different you don't see you know that many of these on the road like you would see at an edge or in grand cherokee and let's be honest here i don't really particularly like the way the current edge drives i also don't really like the way the grand cherokee drives with the v6 you got to go for the v8 if you want the grand cherokee and then there's the passport of course which i think the passport has a transmission that i don't love the nine-speed auto is not good and then of course the nissan murano is another option which the murano is a very smooth driving car but a lot of you you know hate the cvt and i also am not fans of the looks of the current generation so the crossport definitely has enough high points in here to warrant a look if you guys are looking for something like this size so the 2020 volkswagen atlas crossport may not be the sportiest vehicle in the segment to drive that's not its mission of this car you can't deny how ridiculously practical the atlas cross sport is just like the three row atlas the cross sport offers a lot of space in the second row and the cargo area and the front seats because it's the same width and rides on the same wheelbase it being three inches shorter does give this car a slightly different look in fact unlike the honda passport which always constantly reminds you that it's a pilot uh the crossboard definitely has a unique look at the rear now of course the front will remind you of the regular three row atlas but i think that vw did a good job with making this thing look a little bit more standoutish especially the r-line package that gives you the 21-inch wheels this tourmaline blue exterior color and just the sloping rear roof line of the rear area it reminds me a lot of the lamborghini eras and the audi q8 and keep in mind this is about half the price of something like the audi q8 now of course the cross sport isn't perfect i wish that the interior looked a little bit more special to kind of match the premium look on the outside and i also think that this one here at 46 000 should be the fully loaded version i don't like how i have to go to a premium package to get things like the real leather and the ventilated seats which will push the price a little over 50 000 but this car starts at around 31 550 which is about a thousand dollars more versus the three-row atlas it represents a good deal and it's going to be less expensive versus cars like the jeep grand cherokee and the ford edge but keep in mind that the hyundai santa fe and subaru outback which are smaller vehicles will be less expensive versus this fully loaded atlas but with all that said i hope you guys have enjoyed my full overview on this 2020 atlas cross board with the six cylinder engine

another episode of stuck at home with Audrey and we we are making Sarah Padres yay everything that's going around like on tick-tock and stuff so I wanted to try it myself to see if I can find a healthier alternative to actually eating sour punch gummies so let's start by showing you some epic b-roll and then we'll get into the recipe yeah [Music] so these are the ingredients that you're going to need some jello grapes and a lemon so the first thing you want to do is squeeze the lemon onto your grapes and then you want to mix it so that it is evenly coated then you pour your jello into different sipoc bags or a bowl whatever you choose to do this is what you're gonna end up with the next thing that you want to do is divide your grapes into all the different Ziploc bags and then you just shake shake shake and then you basically just repeat the process with all the other different jello flavors and then you just put all the different flavor grapes into one bowl so that looks really colorful and [Music] it is done first impression you guys it looks so colorful look at this look at this Wow yep so as we mentioned we got the blueberry flavor what's called berry blue berry blue flavor this is strawberry we've got dark reddish cherries and we got the yellow one like right here is lemon yes I will show it cuz I love strawberry Cheers don't take a shower you know it's really good you know when you say like South pasture I don't expect like that like like stronger care of salad yes but is it so good mm-hmm Oh cherry one's good the lemon was really good is it more sour since this lemon hmm sour uh hmm the lemon flavored one you for sure gets the sour patch quick effect it's so so good got that for you is it like sugar okay but it's I feel like it's better than like actual sour punch no this is way better cuz you got real grape also you could probably do less of the like jello packet you know sort of things I said no direct measurement I don't have to do it you just kind of like mine oh yeah I have but if you do like less jello I think I'll be good you don't need it to be like fully cooked cuz like if you see here this one has like a lot of the jello mm-hmm like sugar oh these are so good yeah you do make these please tag us on Instagram anyways we hope you guys know you soon here don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and don't forget to keep reading and I see you next video bye [Music]", "6Hl3cNkK_i8": "I just want to say I wake up to this every morning and it's so beautiful long story short these are the materials that I have bought from

never about you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "8VszmM5mV1Y": "how many grapes are poisonous for your dog that's today's question okay so my next question was sent in by JP who writes hello can you help my dog ate yogurt covered raisins about 50 of them and she weighs 80 pounds I then had another question that says my 7 month old puppy ate two grapes she's approximately 20 pounds will she be okay well you know both of these owners are right in thinking that raisins and grapes can be very poisonous to dogs now we don't know exactly what it is that causes the poisoning but what happens is the whatever it is in the raisins and grapes results in kidney damage and kidney failure which ultimately can lead to death and can be quite efficient at killing a dog now different individuals have different susceptibilities and this is where the challenge comes in with knowing kind of how many is is dangerous for an individual dog and what to do about it if they do get into a bunch of a bunch of grapes or a box of raisins or baking or cakes or anything like that that have got raisins in it so over Easter you know we think of hot cross buns you know if potentially got lots of raisins and can be very dangerous so because of this it's always best to err on the side of caution because if we wait too long it may be actually too late to successfully treat them and to help their kidneys once we're seeing signs of illness so kidneys are very sensitive to different topic - different toxins and they don't regenerate so if we're getting an awful lot of damage then you know make potentially things will be too late - no amount of treatment will be able to to save them and to kind of reverse some of the damage that's been done now I've actually I'm just produced a calculator so that you can see the potential toxic dose for your dogs so for an 80 pound dog we're talking about eighty four grapes is the dangerous dose so getting into 50 you know it's potentially you know potentially safe and I say potentially because there's also been cases where dogs have had kidney damage occur at lower than the supposed toxic dose so like I say I think it's always best to err on the side of caution and in this case I would definitely recommend going and seeing your vet I'm having them checked over you know potentially going on IV fluids and having some blood tests done to check that the kidneys are working fine because really we don't want to mess around with this if kidneys and like I say have kidney damage has happened and we're picking that up two three four days later because the dog is becoming really unwell then the likelihood is is that it's going to be too late to do anything really significant about that the flipside is is that a lot of dogs will be able to eat raisins and grapes without having any problems at all but there's just no way of knowing we don't have a test that we can look at that says which dog is going to be sensitive and which isn't you know that would be a fantastic thing to have but we just don't have that certainly at present you know that may be something that comes around in the future so yeah if you're ever concerned go and check out that calculator I'll leave the links in the description but that's also available in my resource center I'm if you sign up for the knowledge vault um so yeah I'll leave the link in the show

Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more

notifies you every time i post a new review that being said let's get into tonight's review i have with me a can of nitro iced macchiato from southern tier brewing company lakewood new york this is an imperial white milk stout and comes at 10 abv as you all know i love these southern tier brewing companies blackwater series i've never seen this one this one is new to me i had the creme brulee i've had the hot chocolate i've had the s'mores i need this one and i found this one so i was really excited shout out to blue ice he does beer reviews too on youtube and that is the first place i saw this one and i think he's the first one and the only one that i've seen do it so i'm pretty excited about it his review is good this review is probably going to be pretty good i'm excited i can't i can't help it i'm sorry i'm getting lost in my thoughts because i just can't wait to try this beer can art on this beer is actually the exact opposite it's like parallel universe right it's kind of simple kind of like the rest of southern tier stuff only everything's flipped right it's just the exact opposite it's still nothing crazy or fancy just basic just it's a lighter color the other ones are black with a little bit of light in it this one's all light with a little bit of black in it that's enough the can art now you know what it's time for we're gonna crack this open so i can tip it upside down and pour it look at it watch the bubbles cascade which is so awesome and smell it taste it and get you your rating there's that gurgle huh i love this i love these nitro pores i can already smell the coffee look at that that's big and watch the beer rise in it this is such a cool thing to watch i love this man that coffee is so strong i can just smell it now this actually isn't going as fast as i thought it's kind of slowed down right anyway let's get a smell on this let's see what we got here yeah this just smells like starbucks right i'm not a huge coffee person i'll get an americano or drink black coffee and the occasional frappuccino when i'm feeling like i deserve a treat or a reward but yeah this smells like big b or starbucks i've never had a macchiato or at least i don't think i have but yeah this just smells like coffee i'm actually pretty excited about it let's give it a taste as always on half ass beer review we go little drink big drink cheers everybody man this is awesome super creamy strong coffee afterthought on your taste all while still being creamy or foam you know that foam that creaminess a little bit of caramel in here man this is good this is very good i'm gonna take another drink and give you a rating very good might be an understatement yeah this beer is great southern tier doesn't let down with this black water series all of them are just phenomenal sure some are better than the others this might be close to one of my favorite ones just just because of how much of a coffee flavor there is to it i love coffee just coffee in general i love the smell of coffee love the taste of it i got a new beard oil with coffee scent to it yeah this beer is great i'm giving this one a 5.6 just an absolutely great nitro beer like a nitro what stout yeah milk stout i mean just everything about this is great uh just the smell of it and the taste they just line up perfectly and just knock it out of the park actually i'm not surprised because southern tier does this with all their nitro stout and most of their beers it's actually a really solid brewery whenever you see something from them you should probably pick it up just to try it and you'll probably like it but that's going to do it for this episode of half ass beer review if you enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up looks just like this it's right down there

"7sbBD0UQ7BQ": "was weird how your life changed but it's all right man started smoking weed so i thought about my life man [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome to my [ __ ] channel if you guys are new this is a great video for you guys to start with we are making as you guys seen from the title thc infused firecracker grapes i think they came out pretty good if you guys want to see them you have to stay tuned before we get this video started stop what you're doing make sure you subscribe make sure you turn on your post notifications so you're notified every single time another video like this uploads also just let me know down below if you guys want another video like this because i do have one other in mind and i think that i might just start doing cannabis infused foods and videos like that so let me know down below if that's something that you guys would like to see again without further ado let's get straight into the video but first it wouldn't be a video of mine if we weren't smoking all right all right all right welcome to my [ __ ] show and tell y'all okay so we're just gonna get the voiceover started bear with me i've never done a voiceover before but we're just going to hop straight into this so basically this part is optional we just wanted to take all the jolly ranchers out in one session so we could just throw them in the baggies that i'm about to put them in so that's what we're doing here damn okay so once you're done unwrapping all the jolly ranchers you want to throw them in a baggie if you don't have a food processor i'm just ratchet as [ __ ] and i didn't have a food processor so i decided to throw them in a baggie um double bag it triple back it and then use a hammer to basically hammer the hard candies down into a fine powder you really want the powder to be as fine as possible and have less bigger chunks of the jolly ranchers because it's a hard candy and it's not going to be really enjoyable to eat if there's really big hard crystals on the grapes yeah i'm saying it just doesn't make sense so crush those [ __ ] down make a little powder out of it or whatever now the powder is what it should look like those hard crystals i actually went back in and actually crushed them up finer here's the pot i'm gonna put half a cup of water half a cup of this cornstarch right here also sorry for the mess you know and just ignore that anyways so yeah so equal parts water and equal parts corn syrup and then you want to do two cups yes [ __ ] i know that's a lot of [ __ ] sugar two cups of sugar you want to mix that around i didn't turn the heat on until after so i can get all the ingredients in the pot and it won't start boiling i do recommend starting on like a medium heat and don't get into the hot heat yet here i am putting a lemon in the pot just because the recipe that i said the recipe that i listened to needs it said to put in some kind of citrus so i added this lemon here is the wax that i'm gonna put in each of these containers is 620 milligrams i believe and i basically put a little bit more than one and a half so it should be a pretty potent this is my regular ass broke ass thermometer your girl didn't buy no candy thermometer because [ __ ] it i was just gonna eye it so i was done with the thermometer it was not working now you see it start to boil it starts coming together you're gonna leave it boiling for a while i'm just mixing it up so it doesn't settle at the bottom and to make sure that all the sugar that's in the mixture is getting dissolved now you want to add some food coloring you want to add some food coloring when it hits about 250 to 260 degrees if you guys have a candy thermometer you don't need to stir the food coloring in because the bubbling itself is actually going to make the red color go throughout the pot you should see a red orange kind of color like this if you're doing it right [ __ ] if you're doing it right also you can use any food color you want damn [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] is taking so long my mom wanted to try a grape without the thc so that's just me digging my little fingers up in the syrup so i can get her grape before i add the wax into it god damn i'm taking another hit so here i'm scooping the wax out of the container and just throwing it straight into the pot you can use waxy i think you can use shatter i think you can use distillate honestly the mixture that is boiling is going to be so hot that is going to melt the wax just remember to use a dab tool to get all the wax out of there put it in the pot stir it around so it's mixed in there nice and good and it gets evenly distributed oh guess i have to cross it oh a little bit more oh oh that was a big chunk yep we're just stirring stirring stirring so because i don't have a candy thermometer you're supposed to be done at about 300 degrees you're supposed to let it start to cool a trick is if you don't have a candy thermometer get ice cold water and take some of the mixture and put it in the cold water and if it hardens then your candy is done this was difficult for me i think i ended up messing up on this part so don't listen to your girlfriend go get yourself a candy thermometer i swear but it didn't turn out too bad so i actually turned the heat off which is why you're seeing the bubbles start to go down we are almost done with our [ __ ] firecracker grapes y'all so i just took a um a skewer you can find these like where you barbecue or anything like that um i poked the grape put it in the syrup and now i'm just dipping it all in the jolly ranchers you do like such the jolly rancher mixture might get hard just continuously mix it with like a fork um and you maybe want to do like two different bowls or something when you do the jolly ranchers because it does get really hard especially once the candy syrup gets within the jolly ranchers it was quite difficult but you manage you manage you'll get there so just get a lot of syrup on there and start throwing all the powder all over your grapes and it should stick they should taste very very yummy oh yeah also you guys see the napkin because when you take the grapes and you wash the grapes you want to pat them dry before you take them you put them into the sugar mixture so that the sugar mixture sticks to the grapes that is very very important they will stick to the grapes without you doing it but it's gonna stick a whole lot better if you just dry them off first damn look how [ __ ] bomb these look i've been watching this like damn these look real good i better go in the house and have me some and that is it you guys thank you so much for watching this i can't wait to try these grapes and let you guys know how they tasted and if i got high or not i guess that's the question of the night since we did almost put i think we put about a thousand milligrams so we'll see how high they get us i will definitely let you guys know in the next video so make sure you subscribe make sure you hit the bell until you post notifications and i'll talk to you guys in the next one thank you for watching my video bye guys", "lKS_Yu1LxqA": "what's up easy bakers so in honor of st patrick's day we're going to be making some fewd pebbles rice krispies treats for today's video but if you haven't already follow us on instagram at edbaker's llc and let's go ahead and be a gang gang by hitting that subscribe button so let's go ahead and jump into this easy behind recipe well i believe this step is optional about adding parchment paper to whatever pan you're going to use but i just like to make sure that none of my treats stick so i'm just gonna use a little bit of nonstick spray spray that add some parchment paper on that or you can use your infused butter but i'm going ahead and spraying parchment paper on the pan as well as on the parchment paper itself and i'm just making sure that all of my edges are nice and clean and crisp so first you want to go ahead and take your butter i did not tell y'all this is going to be a fuse anywho this is going to be infused so to this i'm using four tablespoons of infused butter now if you don't know how to infuse your butter i will leave a link in the description box as well as in the i cards for you for a tutorial on how i make my infused butter but if you don't want to have this infused that's all right girl go ahead and use some regular butter just use four tablespoons of salted butter put your tem put your scope on a medium low before you infuse folks this is a little tip for you y'all see that butter that i ran out of that was in that mason jar what i like to do to make sure that my stuff is great and potent i take my mini marshmallows because i am using 15 ounces of mini marshmallows and i'm just taking them pouring them in that mason jar and using my hands to get all of that extra butter that likes to clean on the side now if you are a original schmidt or digital type of easy baker you know i get all my product you feel what i'm saying you see the difference in that but anyway so back to the video so now you want to take 15 ounces of mini marshmallow and put that inside of that pan with the butter and if you're not using any infused butter you're going to wait until your butter melts down but now you're just going to wait well look at this boom y'all see all that look at that gone girl we got all of that honey so once i get my marshmallows in there i just like to mix it up a little bit because my butter has already is already melted down i just want to make sure that all of the marshmallows are coated with the butter and like i said before my heat is on a medium low heat and what you're gonna do is just gonna continue to stir this as you guys can see the marshmallows are melting now so it's not gonna take that long at all and you guys can actually do this in microwave you don't even need to do it on the stove and i'm going to add a splashy dash dash of vanilla extract this is my little secret that i like to give it a little you don't know what i'm saying a little stretchy so i'm just going to go ahead and mix that vanilla all the way in waiting until my marshmallows melt down then i'm going to remove it from the heat and add my fruity pebbles so go ahead and dump in all seven ounces of seven cups i'm sorry of your futy pebbles with the heat off and just slowly mixing that in together until everything is as sticky as possible girl [Music] now that you have everything all mixed in you're just going to go ahead and dump it in your prepared pan getting a thing of water which is very important this extra water that you have right here is going to prevent the the treats from sticking to your hand so every time that you go ahead and try to um what is it called like even out your rice krispie treats you're going and you notice that they're starting to the marshmallows is starting to stick to your hand just dump your hands in the water really a little bit and it's going to prevent the rice kiss retreats from sticking and i wouldn't meet daverny if i didn't get to rub a spatula and get all of that stuff out of that rubber spatula in that pan y'all why am i like this like everybody else well this is infused so this is why i'm like this but girl i could have been like let's just shut that up to the game don't worry about it girlfriend get all of these rice krispie treats but that's pretty much it you're just going to go ahead and shape your rice krispie treats and form them to that pan on an even like try to get it as even and as flat as you possibly can let that go ahead and harden for a few hours inside the refrigerator and then you're just going to go ahead and cut them up and serve them so after they harden up this is how they're going to look you're just going to cut them into even squares however you want whatever size you want them to be so thank you guys so much for watching this video i really do appreciate you happy st patrick's day and if you guys want to request a video hit it down below and thank you so much for watching this video ttyl girl [Music]", "ZRdx88ye6cQ": "all right we are back at daddy's kitchen with another meal one that has been requested for so so so long i love how you guys actually see him put it back in the drawer and everything it's all about tradition um this is a meal that so many people have been asking about daddy they've been asking for quite some time since instagram days okay so tell the people them what we're cooking today we are cooking steamed fish steamed fish and coconut milk and coconut milk okay all right so there's obviously more to the steamed fish but we are going to show you daddy's version you guys have been asking about snapper and fish and steamed fish and all this stuff there's so many people who do not eat meat and so i'm really happy that we are finally here with another option all right daddy so how do we start this off okay i'm gonna have all of this season together make it much more easier for me to see the location okay all right so it's easier for you to season the fish when you add it all together why is that though oh because you can't sprinkle individually sprinkle yeah everything in one container mix it up put it on the face okay all right so let's see like this okay all right so let's see how this is done we got some flavor rice in there which is you know all finished [Music] okay what else do we have in this concoction fish seasoning fish seasoning cool running springs okay i've never seen that before okay let's bring it over into the light a little bit more okay it's using salt seasoning salt powder garlic powder ginger ginger powder the good old jamaican holy grail all purpose seasonings an onion powder can't forget black pepper the one that makes you sneeze [Music] hilarious mix it up mix it all up and obviously your hands are clean right guys are clean yeah always always mix it all up it smells so good smell all the spices i feel like the fish seasoning might be what makes it super different too because usually your spices don't smell quite like this i think the fish seasoning definitely changes things yes all right okay now we're gonna season our fish all right so how did you prepare this fish steady your washing well we're gonna have to show a video on how to prepare fish because i'm pretty sure it's not as easy as you're making it look right now it's easy what's easy for you we get this fish cleaned from from the place where it buys oh okay so it was already cleaned out okay so you can buy it like i just do my liquor finish wash it make sure all the skills that comes off yeah we're gonna have to do a video on the scale out how clean it is wow it's beautiful yeah clean clean clean that's it can you wash it down with lime and vinegar okay lemon whatever you have okay all right okay so let's see how he sees it now i i go first to the back first to the belly inside probably even the head that some people like to hear about i'm more of like a tale person but there are people here [Music] you go [Music] look at the size of that one [Music] into the belly and out on the skin into the belly and out on the skin so i used to be like really creeped out and i still kind of am creeped out seeing the eyes of the fish there's a lot of people who can eat meat but actually can't eat fish because of the eyes and the fish there's people who are like definitely afraid i think i met someone i can't even remember what's wrong with your head well it's still in there that's the first part yeah exactly and that's why it's even more scary every hundred miles yes i know but when it arrives to your dinner table with it still in there you want to pick it out that's so funny real it's like how i felt with the chicken foot when i was a kid scared yeah toes yeah i do exactly i have toes and now i'm eating their toes and it's like nobody was eating my toes like an invasion of privacy you finally got it finally smell good so do you let them sit yeah i'm gonna cover it okay well 15 to 20 minutes i like these little parts how come you don't put some of those little tail parts i mean or am i look at it guys well coated seasoned from the belly i mean all those smells are not the most enticing thing right now but i'm telling you steam fish when it's cooked oh my gosh my gosh and he's cooking it down it's with some coconut milk today too so these are the things that are gonna hurt so these are all the things that are gonna be added to the fish okay pumpkin pumpkin okra onions thyme red pepper and yellow peppers red pepper and yellow pepper tomatoes tomato pepper hot pepper green screen green scallion green green onion whatever you want to call it and garlic and garlic so later i'm going to chop all of these [Music] cook it down okay and it's going to go into the pot with the fish yes you you you fish you know you pescatarian people i know you are just shaking inside right now and i'm so excited for you because i am too steep fish is like a face okay so next step what are we doing gotta cut up your veggies onions always for the win sliced not diced therapeutic [Music] you might have to come up with an asmr channel that he probably has no clue what that is there's people who literally just want to hear the sounds of certain things like they really like they will sit there and just listen to you chop the onions because yeah or listen to you chew on to something or bite ice or or yeah it's famous oh you'd be surprised there's probably people who are obsessed with like the sound of chopped vegetables and stuff you could be making millions on here by just that maybe we really should we're gonna get somewhere excited are you gonna do that yeah you just gotta i'm gonna show you you're gonna cry okay so this is the you're gonna try laughing um i just know you are um okay so that's pumpkin right yeah okay so he's chopping dicing up the pumpkin this will be not too big but decent sizes putting it all in here [Music] [Music] [Music] green onions or scallions or scallions depending on where you're from crush [Music] and chop finally oh my gosh always doing that starch bonnet pepper can't forget it scotch bonnet pepper is obviously the pepper of choice for jamaican because i don't see them ever use any other pepper that's a flavor yes okay looking gorgeous look at that you guys look at that i love seeing all the colors all the veg that goes into these meals just beautiful okay so what's next fire is on fire is own and what heat are we starting max right now it's on max okay all right what oil are we using olive oil how come we're not using the grapeseed oil that we usually use feeling olive oily today yeah okay what else here for you better for you okay [Music] see what i'm saying i see what you're saying let it get hot okay and then what do the veggies go in first put in the onions and the garlic okay so the onions and the garlic are going to go first get more flavor out of the onions than you got okay some flavors so you said sweat it off meaning like you just allow it to cook a little bit first okay and then okay we'll just watch we'll just watch how it goes i'm always skipping ahead you know anxious to learn okay i'm gonna turn the heat down okay so you just felt it so it's hot enough so now you turn it down to medium okay majority [Music] okay now we're gonna sweat them but they're already sweating unlocking the flavors that change lives call it gotcha see how sweet i am with that camera huh now we put the garlic in so we don't sweat that garlic a little bit and i wish you that because as it's sweating it's definitely really sting don't it won't burn your body don't get [Music] [Music] bitter okay now my pumpkin pumpkin and peppers okay this is all real time guys still the amount of time that this has taken like you've been here so this is not sped up this moment here this is real time so if you're doing the same thing at home you're gonna be able to make this meal to the tea baby to the teeth because that was like my issue when watching like cooking videos sometimes i'm like well i don't know what they sped up i don't know how long they kept it on i don't know certain details and so you're like oh i don't know but the great thing about this is that you're literally watching this cook with us tell me a better channel and if you know that this channel is the channel you need to like right now give this video a thumbs up right now mid cooking okay and drop down in the comments what you want us to cook next next up green onions tomatoes okra hot peppers got your bodies all right on my screen it's showing that it's been three minutes since we first put in the onions and stuff guys so that should just go to show you timing is not too crazy right it's been three minutes and 26 seconds since the onions first went in the pot so if that gives you a little bit of a better understanding so that you can kind of scale it towards your to your own meal okay do you remember the seasoning remember the seasoning so it's coming back the leftovers the okay in here are screaming because they're like the pot is perfect just as is right now right as it is doesn't need any fish it doesn't need any meat it doesn't need anything because i'm sure when this cooks down by itself it's delicious as debbie would say oh yeah okay so you put all the seasoning in [Music] there so you turn your heat back up yes okay because we've been slow down the heat okay so because everything's thrown in it'll slow down the heat okay so you got to bring it back up a little bit so you can really get it all to sweat then you're gonna add in your what teddy my coconut milk okay yeah my dad's been on this coconut milk flex daddy what is it with you and this coconut milk you guys are like best friends lately it's a lot of flavor in coconut coconut very good for you sure this is the best let's see the brand all right charles organic okay all right looks delicious doesn't it you guys i know you might be you might be like me but i trust this guy that's one thing i'll tell ya this guy in the camera you guys you guys have learned to trust him too trust him i put some water in it okay so you added some water okay why did you add water that's not enough to cook the fish down i'm learning so you need enough like liquid in the pot in order to cook whatever meat or poultry or whatever it is like you can't have just like a little bit you have to have a good amount so that everything can cook down in it a tasty apart see if it need a little salt i know you don't need any more seasoning oh yeah it's good need some more need some more seasoning and put seeds salt okay so he's adding more seasoning salt i'm gonna make this boil before okay so this has to boil before the fish is added before you put your fish okay going in for some real butter what does the butter do flavor flavor flavor flavor flavor flavor and more flavor so i'm gonna cover it okay approximately how long do you think that we're gonna be covered for you guys look at how he struggles as he tries to put on pot cover that doesn't go with the bottom of that pot but remember remember you guys it's not great it's not real authentic jamaican cooking if the parts are matched don't make no sense okay [Laughter] um yes so how long do you think approximately 10 minutes covered up cooked and then we're adding the fish okay you don't want that pumpkin to cook yeah because you don't want raw pumpkin seed right here hardest thing to cook is the pumpkin so you kind of created like a little soup for it to cook it right interesting so what i'm just going to turn to gravy once that finish okay so basically you're making your pre-making the gravy yes interesting yes these guys have been sitting chilling for the last couple hours [Music] when these are fried oh my gosh you guys i know we're not frying them today but my favorite way to have them is fried oh my okay so 10 minutes has gone by and let's look at the geesh look at it you guys this is the bed that that beautifully seasoned fish is going to take a little bath in look at this oh my gosh you guys are you you're killing me man daddy you're killing me in the best way look at this you guys look at this look at this wow so you just kind of press down you need a bigger puck definitely looks like you need a bigger pot for real [Music] see one squeeze her in on the side this that's the question you should have put the big one in first that's what us plus size girlies do we get the front seat first everybody can mangle up in the back you know you know the vibes that you really where your fish will go i'm gonna find i'm gonna cut it you're gonna cut it and then put it in smart guys look at this look at this man if you ever smell the seasoning and the coconut milk cheese cheese look at this oh my gosh oh i'm struggling i need my cookie boy careful daddy please no butter i am the man he's not a fish i have called for him okay this the fish like that wow that fish is huge what the heck look at okay get out of the seasoning that's left okay turn it back up high see i would feel like oh no i shouldn't leave all that stuff at the bottom because it's gonna burn but not no no see pumpkin already cooked pumpkins cooked so by the time these fish cook the pumpkin give a nice gravy by the time the pumpkins cooked the fish oh the one time the fish is cooked the gravy will be nice nicer really nice nice hair oh oh oh okay cover it and how long approximately are you thinking now daddy 10 15 minutes 10 15 minutes and it's done max 15 minutes 15 minutes because fish doesn't take long right okay okay so squatting now boiling i'm gonna turn it down to medium okay turn it back down to medium while it cooks while it takes that 15 minutes right it's a 15 minute medium bath betty it smells like jamaica in here yeah i know but it smells like when we went to go get that fish oh my gosh you guys look at it already look at what's happening in here just to be careful you turn it underneath it it's already cool so you got to be really careful because it'll break up okay but what are you doing right now you're just like shifting them a little bit so they can get everything okay so that they can get some loving on all their sides see that what you have to be careful you're really cool five more minutes wow quick meal daddy five more minutes yes see i get good stuff this is not like and for recording sake i feel like this meal is appearing to take longer but you guys this is such a fast efficient meal especially if you want to make something delicious really authentically jamaican really tasty you know that's not going to take a whole lot of time but still like it's a thorough meal this is it look at that i just want to drink that i know it's so good you can drink it that's good for you fish soup soup people have been asking about fish soup too daddy he's super engraving so you need to get into it yes it's coming take time okay patience yes tell them again because people will be coming for me people will be coming for me oh i hope it's not like someone said i hope it's not the same um as taking as long as sasha's videos on her channel i said

"2cWaf5fG8rs": "hey guys I haven't been on in a while so I'm coming should I get a new video and this is like completely different from what I usually do I'm doing a tutorial on these fabulous things and they are called sour patch grapes they're a healthy alternative to the sour patch candy and it's a simple recipe if you can't do this then I'm a prayer for you okay because it's like super easy then you cannot mess this up if you mess with something again I will pray for you okay it's grapes and then you know you post a wet grapes before you eat them like clean them off and a bowl of course spoon a plate and jello I chose lime jell-o because I felt like that would taste the best with these grapes so yeah let's get into the touch hottie uh I should have started from the beginning showing you guys how I did it so and look as messy like that looks horrible right now but you get just that what I did when I show you this so basically you take your grapes put them in a bowl and then you go over to the seat you fill it up with water and rinse off your grapes and pour most of the water out this bowl is stained it's not dirty it's like staying from over over time cooking things so don't think this bowl is dirty it's clean so yeah you soak your grapes it's not so cold but you know like clean them leave a little bit of water in there so don't stay away and then you take a grape excuse my nails guys I've been going through the struggle the real struggle of getting jail nails off without going back to the nail salon because I'm cheap like that sometimes like why am I paying you to take off what you did like but yeah you put the grape over here where you put the jello you put the whole thing of jello onto the plate you get a spoon and just coat it coat the entire grape to make sure all the sides are covered and yeah after you put the grape this is what you do me and these are just for me so I'm gonna touch it on the dishes but if I was making it for a bunch of people I would just use the spoon but it's just like shake off the excess because you don't want to miss and then put it over on a plate or the rest of them are and you do that to the rest of the your grapes and then when you're done you put your grapes in the refrigerator okay and then you put it in a refrigerator for about an hour or so and yeah you had to say in your refrigerator okay try one how is it", "g4YQxTLcNjE": "winter is not over yet almost over spring is almost here and do i have a great recommendation for you so if you're looking for a great american imperial porter and one that will surely make you look like a connoisseur then join me on this tasting my name is eddie and i have tasted and sampled many beers from all over the world and it is my passion to help you find that perfect beer you're looking for whether you're looking to try something new or there is something very specific that you're looking for to pair with your foot i got your back [Music] welcome back beer lovers thank you for spending the next few minutes with me as i said in the intro my name is eddie and on this channel i taste and review all kinds of beers and give you my most honest opinion about them as well as some ideas to pair them with your food just like the one you're about to watch so if you're new here consider subscribing and hitting that bell icon down there so you're notified every time i release and you'll be a review video if you like the video hit that thumbs up let me know you like it now what did i say i have an imperial porter other wise known also as a baltic porter so um you know those those two styles are pretty pretty similar sometimes they are you know also known as kind of stuff and today i have one from this brewery that i have never tried anything from them before they are out of idaho laughing dog brewery and i'm bringing you their pecan porter today check it out that's right pecan porter that sounds tasty and guess what i'm going to pour that on in to my nonic pine here which is the glass i recommend that you use when you're putting yourself a nice border whether it's a robust porter or an imperial porter or any other kind of powder and remember having the right glass for the beer that you are tasting is always an important piece of being a beer connoisseur so if you want to get your own set of beer concert tv glasses look in the description below check out the store and see how you can get your hands on a nice set of glasses now where do we always start appearance more importantly the three c's of appearance which are color clarity and carbonation that is right now the color it was or it is but you know you can be full and think that this is black it was very very dark brown color very clear actually it was clear when i poured it a nice carbonation yeah i would call that a very lots of action carbonation the head it's not as big a head of foam you know and it's dissipating somewhat quickly i mean you can see some of the lacing you've lost about half a finger already but it's still a nice still head there and it's nice green color head of foam so very very nice appearance all around now where do we go next aromas right well they're not trying to hide that pecan for sure it smells like caramelized pecans in there and all kinds of kind of like vanilla maybe even a hint of kind of like espresso or maybe even like a cappuccino scent uh smell there yeah very very nice sweet malty kind of aromas there it smells like dessert to be honest with you and i like pecan pie so maybe that's what i'm thinking about and now i'm going to taste it and let you know how it goes well slightly different than i expected i would say it's a lot it's a lot more bitter than i would have led to believe with such sweet aroma so tip of the tongue is very bitter actually the carbonation is nice throughout so you know if you're looking for something that cleanses your palate very nice carbonation and then that malt base with some of that sweet pecan caramelized pecan maybe burnt sugar and even a hint of like i said roasted coffee maybe like espresso all that comes through the middle then what lingers is a dry bitterness so it's and i'm still feeling kind of like a smoky even peppery dry bitterness there in the back of the palate that that kind of lingers so uh just keep that in mind but it's very very good i would call that light to medium body so again it was a lot more um it has a lot you know it was more bitter and a little bit heavier than i thought it was going to be from the appearance and the aromas but it's not a heavy beer at all it's maybe a little bit light to medium body there um that all comes important when we go to the next piece which is the part that you come to me for the part that makes you a concert the foot pairings right now porters you know they are bold beers with bold foods you want to pair them with foods that are equally bold so that the food can stand up to the beer and in this case we always look for you know meats grill meats smoked meats that have maybe sauces and stuff like that and in this case the first thing i'm going to say check it out honey pecan barbecue sauce chicken sliders yes it's a thing look it up if you don't believe me but that is going to be a great great pairing because a lot of those flavors are going to harmonize and like i said nice carbonation throughout by the way this is 8.1 alcohol by volume and i could barely barely uh taste some of that alcohol so they they do a nice nice job of you know kind of like balancing all the flavors there but because of the alcohol that's also going to help you enjoy some of those bold foods like the one i just i just um suggested also if you like thai food and if you're like you know noodles and stuff like that thai peanut noodles yes it's going to go great with the beer again it has that pecan flavor so a little bit of that nutty peppery peas part of the beer all those are going to really help you enjoy that thai food and it has enough malt to stand up to spicy food so go and enjoy your spicy foods with this beer because it's definitely going to to help you you know put down the fire when you need it when you need it to and um you know i rarely give any suggestion to vegetarians and i don't want to forget my vegetarian friends who love beer so a nice grilled portobello mushroom burger with some caramelized onions on top that will go great with this pecan powder that i have here so all those are my suggestions and as far as the cheese is smoke gruyere yes anything because what i have been learning and teaching you as i've been learning here is beers that have that long kind of smoky part of the taste they benefit from a smoky cheese to kind of pair and sound like it can almost like a rest it stops some of that smokiness from lingering way too much in the back there so i think a small gruyere would be a great great pairing with this beer now you know you can always trust me to leave you a great recommendation as far as a dessert pairing and today i think you're going to enjoy that again if you enjoy this kind of flavors here that's going to be a winning pairing there for you my friend now that concludes today's lesson but not before i ask you have you had laughing dog pecan porter before how have you enjoyed it have you enjoyed it with food have you drank it solo what are your impressions what are your comments leave me some comments below that's how we we all continue on this journey right so i hope i have helped you increase your beer knowledge as we all continue on this journey of becoming beer connoisseurs and i encourage you to be on the lookout over the next few days when i release my next beer review video and until then [Music] enjoy", "eEfH4hdeaes": "[Music] hey um welcome back to my channel and fist your first video clipping on my name is Katie and I make videos every single week but today's video is gonna be a such a fun video it is going to be something different on my channel and it's going to be how to make super easy and delicious sour patch grapes so if you are somebody that really loves sour patch kids like I do this probably clicked on this video um but if you love that dessert but you were like I don't really know if I want you to all those calories or you don't want something that's like that unhealthy all the time this is an amazing alternative and like I literally can't get over how easy and simple it is to do it also doesn't cost that much money um the most expensive thing that I had to buy was a grapes and grapes for eight dollars I was like oh my gosh I don't ever remember spending $8 on grapes but my grapes are eight dollars so that's the only thing that is kind of expensive but it is a healthier alternative and it honestly tastes exactly like it I honestly like it a little bit more because you get like the crunch from the grape and like it kinda like gushes so it kind of tastes like a gushers I don't know this is just an amazing dessert so if you guys want to learn how to make this super simple and easy dessert keep on watching and also make sure you subscribe before leaving this channel okay let's get into it okay you only need three ingredients for this recipe you're going to need green grapes jell-o mix this up any kind of flavors you like and also a lemon so first what I'm gonna do is just grab a colander and put it in the sink and then I'm gonna start taking off the grapes one by one from the vines I use three bunches of grapes and it worked perfect but definitely if you have a smaller serving size or a bigger serving size just use how many grapes that you would like now I'm just going to go ahead and rinse through the grapes thoroughly to make sure they're all nice and clean and pull out any of the vines that may have film okay so now I'm just putting those in a different kind of bowl and I'm gonna go ahead and cut the lemon in half you can definitely use a whole lemon if you like yours to be a little more sour but I found that half a lemon was just enough because Sean doesn't really love stuff that's super sour so this was like a perfect medium now I'm just gonna go ahead and mix the grapes with the lemon juice to make sure that's all nice and mixed now we're gonna take just sandwich bags and take out the different flavors and put them in the sandwich bags I love these three flavors I used grape strawberry and orange and I found that it was a really good variety you gonna get sick of one flavor because they all kind of like we're different and they tasted like real sour patch kids so definitely recommend it these three flavors for you guys just gonna go ahead and put the grapes into the jello mix little bags that we made and you're just gonna want to zip those up and then shake thoroughly and definitely you have to watch yourself because it is so easy to overheat on these but just put in a bowl and put them out to serve and they are such an easy and delicious dessert that everyone's gonna love okay enjoy this video this is such an easy dessert to make especially if you're having like a large group of friends come over or if you're having family or just you by yourself you know whatever you want to do but it does taste really good and it's definitely a better alternative to eating candy all the time we know down in the comments down below if

here and i'll show you how in today's video we are going to bake something with it i asked you guys in the comment section what you guys wanted me to bake with it and the number one comment was chocolate chip muffins and i'm totally down for a chocolate chip muffin i love muffins and i'm a basic guy i don't like a lot of crazy like random things like cranberry muffins or anything like that like blueberry muffins chocolate chip muffins that's that's about it so today we're going to turn this can of butter into some chocolate chip muffins i want to give a huge shout out to magical for sponsoring this video and for sending over a magical butter machine to give away i will be giving away a magical butter machine on my instagram page check me out on buds and beards on instagram for your chance to win a magical butter machine thank you so much magical for sending this over and without further ado let's get into making some weedy chocolate chip muffins oh yeah you guys can use cookbook and beards to save 20 off at passionbutter.com okay now let's get into making some weedy muffins there are a few ingredients that you will need to make these cannabis-infused chocolate chip muffins you'll need one and a half sticks of melted can of butter two cups of all-purpose flour two large eggs a half a cup of milk 3 4 cups of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and lastly 1 cup of chocolate chips let's get to making some muffins the first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 375 degrees [Music] the first thing we want to do is add all our dry ingredients to the mixer so i'm gonna add the flour the sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and then we are going to mix that up [Music] once you're done combining your dry ingredients then it's time to add your wet ingredients the first thing i'm going to add is the melted can of butter [Music] the vanilla and the two large eggs and mix those ingredients well [Music] once you've mixed that well you can add your cup of chocolate chips [Music] and our muffin batter is done before we fill our muffin pan with our batter we need to prepare the pan and what better way to prepare it than using more peanut butter i'm going to use a tablespoon of melted can of butter and i'm going to brush that all over each of the muffin tins now that our muffin pan is prepared it is time to add the batter to each of the tins all right we're going to place these in the oven for 20 minutes what just had a thought i think once the muffins are about halfway done baking i'm going to add on top a little bit of sugar and brown sugar just to give it a little bit of extra sweetness we're trying to hide that wheaty taste as much as possible so little sugar topping to it these are our cannabis infused chocolate chip muffins yes i went a little bit ham on the sugar topping but i'm gonna let these cool for about probably 10 minutes and then we'll try one all right you guys i'm back i've been waiting over these muffins waiting on them and i think they're ready i think they're ready i think they're ready okay so i'm so excited i have a nice glass of milk let's get one of these muffins out and try one first things first the can of butter worked really well at acting as a non-stick like type spray because it came out all in one piece like this is the most perfect little [Music] it smells a little weedy i'm not gonna lie when we were baking it it didn't smell at all but like now that it's actually in my hand i can definitely smell the candy butter which is [Music] um it's not the best it doesn't taste the best it's not the best tasting on a scale of one to ten i'd give it probably like a a six it's edible oh my god it looks green [Music] look at that it literally looks like lime green inside of the muffin from the can of butter and the taste is just like it's just so off it has like such a strong wheaty taste but you guys know i'm gonna still eat it so that i can give you guys a report on how did it make me feel i both said from the big bite that i had at first it just kind of felt like a walk on my stomach which is more like how edibles feel when i'm like this is gonna like slam me adding that sugar on top that was a good choice [Music] because there is such an aftertaste to this muffin you were gonna want that sugar it i think it's what it's like saving it like i keep lifting my fingers because like i have the sugar on it and it makes it like slightly better i need some milk gonna go finish my muffin and i'll be back i don't know if i'll have a second muffin or not probably not because like i'm not feeling the taste unless this muffin just like knocks me on my socks and then i might have another one like right now but they're gonna be something i'm gonna have to space out and make myself eat i'm not gonna lie to you guys all right i'll be back in probably like 30 minutes to an hour probably an hour it normally takes about an hour cheers [Music] oh my gosh when i smile ew what gosh no you can't have my muffin no no what the hell all right let's talk it's been like probably 45 minutes and i'm gonna tell you guys what i've never had an edible hit so like hard so fast before ever like ever in my life like these muffins have to be at least probably like [Music] 150 milligrams probably each like these are strong ass muffins um they taste absolutely horrible like no lie this was probably the worst tasting edible that i've had in a while like it was pretty bad like i did not enjoy the taste of it at all the feeling though is amazing like 10 out of 10 recommend for the feeling the only thing that i've ever made that i would recommend more than this would be the sugar cookies that i made at christmas time i think it was last year or the year before those those actually taste pretty good and they were like really effective these taste like crap but they they are really really effective so i'm not mad i'm not bad at all because like at the end of the day this is what we're searching for is like this feeling right here if i'm able to do that with like trim and like a little bit of shake that's amazing because that's just stuff that would have gotten thrown away anyway so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what else you guys want me to make because i still have some peanut butter in this refrigerator over here like we still have three and a half sticks of can of butter over here to make stuff with and we're gonna make stuff with it so let me know what you want let me know what you guys want to see me make out of this canned butter i'm like having problems with my sentences now i'm gonna go check out my instagram page if you guys want to win a magical butter machine you can use cup buds and beards for 20 off at magicalbutter.com and i'll see you guys around for whatever sewing activity or video that i come up with for next time and i hope that like whatever we make is as effective as those muffins and i seriously think that it had something to do with this butter i think that that d-carve box really ensured that i was de-carving that cannabis properly because i feel like my oven was off not that i've made a bunch of edibles in this oven but i bet my other oven was off too and i wasn't de-carving it properly i think that that made all the difference in this butter which made all the difference in those muffins [Music] i'm like out of breath and i slightly have the giggles from the the um the muffin but anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever show activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys [Music] you", "wKX0mVfsrKo": "hello my old school soulful family chef jeffrey back with another video hey y'all today i'm gonna do a quick video i had nothing to do with birthday month had nothing to do with my favorites but something i wouldn't been wanting to try i want to try a mixed berry cobbler here i've seen these before i've never made them before so here i'm going to give it a try here uh the berries here i got is strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries so i see i want to give it a try and see how this will come out so we're going to give it a shot here because i love blackberry cobbler i love blueberry cobbler i love raspberries so we're going to see how it is so i already added my and my sugar to this i've added my my pineapple juice that's the secret of my cobblers if y'all been following me long enough y'all probably have seen me make so many couples so i'm just putting this in here let go and i'll let you know what's in it put my butt in here vanilla and this is my cobbler pot y'all a little vanilla here y'all been following me long enough when i make this when i bring this pot out it means it's cobbler nutmeg little cinnamon and i'm gonna put the description of the video here i'm gonna put the recipe in the description of the video y'all and i'm making this just like i do every other couple the same ingredients and everything the only thing i'm changing is the type of fruit it's going to be the same amount as i do with every other every other cobbler so we're going to let this come to a boil like every cobbler once it come to a boil i'm going to tighten it up with some uh cornstarch and then we'll pour it in the pan put the crust on there and we'll have with some cobbler and i do like everything i'll do others i got half the berries in here and i'm gonna leave half and put in there right in directly into the bacon dish that way these berries get mushy i still have some berries that's uh holy shape that's not in actual in the uh in the actual cobbler so we'll be right back once this gets the boiling i'm gonna get my i'm gonna get my dough and gone put the bottom crust into my y'all know i use uh y'all know i don't make potato i don't have time i'm not gonna waste time making pie dough y'all follow me long enough y'all know i use the peel berry rollout crust so easy so simple uh it's a it's a game changer so anyway i'm gonna put the bottom crust in there and i'm gonna come back like in a few minutes and tighten this up with a cornstarch and we'll go from there we'll be right back okay y'all we back here okay y'all i i like for my uh cobbler to come to a complete bar before i add the cornstarch so it doesn't take us too much longer for it to to take effect before they thicken up but you know cornstarch to really get the full activation out of it your liquid needs to be boiling so we're gonna put the cornstarch in here thicken it up see see how quick it got thick if there hadn't been boiling it would have took longer for a little bit more because i'm gonna make it a little extra thicker because i got the frozen berries over here remember that i took some frozen berries and put in here so that that liquid from the frozen berry is going to thin this out a little as is in the oven so let this cook just a second here see how pretty that feeling is and that's why i took some of the frozen berries out y'all and put in there and not in here because see how it broke it up but it did give it a nice pretty color you got the blueberries in here blackberries raspberries and strawberries okay now what i'm gonna do now how quick that was i'm gonna ladle this in here i would pour it but i think i'll make a mess today so i'm gonna take this let me make sure y'all can see what i'm doing here just a little here okay take this and ladle the juice in here y'all make sure you get most of the berries there see that's why i made it so thick because i know when this started cooking and mixing with the other berries it's going to thin out a lot a little bit more and that's it now over here out of the way now all i'm gonna do now i'm gonna put the top crust on here and we'll be ready to put it in the oven the crop crust is very easy very simple move it over here y'all can see and all i did let me hear you you know the recipe is description of the video i took frozen berries pineapple juice butter like every cobbler cinnamon nutmeg vanilla i make the same way every cobbler y'all no difference no matter what fruit i'm using so now all i'm gonna do is just nothing fancy here just put the topping on there like i told people you don't have to be fancy with this just get it on there get it on there any way you can some people try to be fancy with the lattice cut that ain't me that's not me y'all go there we go and you could put it also just cover it up completely with the dough you don't have to make the little strings like i do i just do this kind of give it like my buddy uh jack chaplin you know of uh daddy jax y'all watch his cooking channel like he say i appeal is half the meal i remember that same time he watched his video he said that sometime i appeal is half the meal meaning presentation very important okay now i'm gonna put some butter on here a little butter i had left over i use a little butter y'all see i got some cornbread sitting there i made some homemade butter beans from my neighbor i've already did rest i already did a video on that i didn't show a video but they want some homemade butter beans and and ham hocks today so i made them that with some cornbread about neighbor got seven people seven a family of seven big ol pot of butter beans and ham hawks can't go wrong for that okay now i got the butter on there now i'm gonna sprinkle it with a little sugar a little sugar on there and then that nice crystallization when it come out and that's it i'm gonna put it over 350 degrees by 30 to 35 minutes and this cobbler will be complete and we'll check it out we'll be right back all right y'all we are back here the cobbler is fresh out of the oven and y'all i'm gonna let this thing sit for like three hours i'm never definitely gonna let it set up and cool off so when i do scoop it it's not uh running all over the place a lot of times i do that and people say oh it's too loose too no it's once it cool off believe me it thickens up so i'm gonna come back in about three hours and we're gonna uh taste a little this the rest of this going to my neighbor like i say tonight i'm cooking them some butter beans and ham hawks and cornbread and this dessert is uh old school mixed berry cobbler i'm gonna take a bowl out of this and give them the rest and let them enjoy so anyway uh we'll be back in about about uh three hours we'll check this out and we'll see how good it is we'll be right back okay y'all we back it's been about a couple hours i let this thing kind of set up and cool off now we're going to cut into this thing it makes a big difference when you let it set up see that man look at all that fruit in there it's also easy to eat easier to eat y'all okay now let's try this out see how this tastes here oh wow the berries they work so well together you got you can taste the blackberries coming through i think that's the dominant fruit in it blackberry and then the raspberry the blueberry custardy the blueberries and the strawberries didn't break down but the raspberry and the blackberry definitely breaks down and definitely the dominant uh flavor coming through but it's awesome my neighbors gonna love this cause i'm gonna get a good melon scoop here and i'm gonna let them have it but yeah try this recipe first time i ever did the fort berry cobbler i did every bird cobbler separately but i never did the four berry cobbler so

since the sheltering in place started I've decided to go live one or more times a day just to introduce you to some really interesting guests and create a sense of community and connection and give us something to do to take our mind off the virus for an hour or two a day so today I have the privilege of speaking to a registered dietician named vesanto melina she was a guest on the truth about weight loss summit this year and she was absolutely fabulous and I just knew I wanted to talk to her some more she co-authored a wonderful cook book along with Brenda Davis who I'm gonna be speaking to next week it's called the kick diabetes cookbook and I've already earmarked the first recipe I'm gonna make isn't that beautiful this is called cauliflower and basmati rice salad so please welcome vesanto melina how're you doing really well wonderfully well yeah you're all the way up in Canada eh that's right in Vancouver it's just gorgeous here and we're having fun gardening Wow well I love to talk about your book but you know so much about diabetes and since we're both in North America can you talk about what the situation in North America is regarding the incidence of diabetes well it's it's pretty amazing how it's changed over the last century or so because it used to be a relatively rare condition and as it turns out now one American in three or more than that has either diabetes or pre-diabetes and we're moving up towards one and two and it's the same in the United States and it's almost to that extent in Canada so it's a pretty pretty difficult situation and pre-diabetes is a situation where your blood sugar isn't as high like your your insulin isn't entirely blocking entry to the cells but there's insulin resistance typically and about 88 million Americans have pre-diabetes so it's a very widely prevalent situation also people that have it have a higher risk of coronavirus of developing serious illness so it's pretty pretty devastating situation and a lot of people have pre-diabetes apparently about 80% of those that do then do not know that they have it so only one in five with pre-diabetes typically knows they have it from the lab test that shows that your blood sugars are somewhat high but not quite as high as diabetes I know I was actually interested because diabetes runs in my family my grandfather had it he ended up getting the complications in my family we had a lot of challenges with blood sugar problems alcoholism diabetes they were all kind of related to pancreas function but I got quite interested in it what exactly is insulin resistance and does everyone that's insulin resistant eventually become diabetic if they don't know and and actually even if you did become type-2 diabetic that can be turned around so insulin resistance means that the insulin receptors are not working properly and insulin can't get glucose into cells but with lifestyle changes such as the way we're eating and exercise and taking care of ourselves and having lots of protective foods we can turn that around and get ourselves working properly again I mentioned in there earlier to you that my dad was actually working with diabetes and when when I was born which was 1942 so I'm 78 my dad was had been working with Sir Frederick Banting who had received the Nobel Prize for discovering insulin they were at the University of Toronto and that's where we were at time and they had isolated insulin and then found that it could be used with diabetics so with type 1 diabetics they could give them the insulin so type 1 diabetes you don't have enough insulin your pancreas just isn't making it and so their solution could change a diabetic into having a normal life before it was a death sentence and that's the meaning because I remember hearing about Banting I didn't realize he discovered insulin or won a Nobel Prize now you got a Nobel Prize for it and it was pretty amazing stuff back then but when I started studying nutrition which was a long time ago it was still considered a relatively rare condition now it's really really common that people have either pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes is somewhat less common but it's still the incidence of all of these has been rising well that it's amazing that you cuz we have a question here from Linda if you could comment on type one I wonder why type one is also rising well again it's related to lifestyle choices so your your body just doesn't work as well when you eat a lot of these high sugar foods high fat foods and highly processed foods we have a quite a different situation so I know people with type 1 diabetes who have been able to not entirely reduce their insulin intake or eliminate it but they could bring up way way down and they did that just by being healthy by eating really well by eating predominantly or entirely plant-based diets that's incredible and by the way since you mentioned and I know you never supposed to ask the woman her age or her weight but you mentioned your 78 I mean you look amazing okay yeah so I I'd like to be a really old vegan that's my goal I'm going for uh-huh I was thinking 105 but now my goal is 118 just a bit come on well I'm let's see you could be there in a few years I mean I think I don't know a lot of people realize that you have not only did you co-author this book with Brendan Davis but you guys are writing partners in many books oh yes we have 14 books 13 books now in 14 languages and so we just came out in Russian and in Hebrew and our books are all plant-based and our real goal was to help people do this in very very good health and to enjoy it like you know this we've gotta taste better and hopefully I'll do it I wouldn't do it well I probably would [Laughter] right Melinda saying that insulin saves her life every day but she's had type 1 diabetes for 55 years but eating a whole food plant-based she has cut her insulin needs in half over the past 20 years oh Linda good for you and I have found that to be the case with so many different people and does she get some exercise as well I think she does Linda can you comment if you get some exercise ok this is happening all week with people commenting on my guests beautiful skin Gina says I can't believe she's 78 her skin looks so nice so just a week ago I've tracked for a minute do you have any skin care of beauty care secrets because with the sheltering in-home we're all wondering how we can see you beautiful when we can't get to any stores to get our products oh thank you no I keep things really simple to tell you the truth I you know wash with water I actually don't even use that much soap I just use water and I get lots of exercise before the coronavirus thing I was typically going for about 10,000 steps a day now I'm up to 12 to 15 because I would go out for a long walk every day always just my husband and I but we don't go near other people you know people are very careful to walk down the middle of the street if you're going by and things like that but I think getting exercise and doing physical things as well as having a plant-based diet now the other thing about skin we know that foods like carotenoids these are in different plant foods green orange yellow those all help us keep healthy skin that's that's so true I think do we get beautiful from the inside out we do yeah yeah linden who you asked about exercise she says she feels much better when she exercise which really didn't answer the question if she regularly does it but I'm assuming she does cuz she's somebody your best and and plus Robert Cheeke is watching so you have to always say yes if you're exercising because we he's great we talked to him a few weeks ago Rosemarie says that you look beautiful and so let's see there was there's a really good question here you know though if the feed goes very fast but um ah from TS if you have been diagnosed type 2 diabetic but change your eating habits and get off the meds are you still insulin sensitive and considered diabetic no if once your blood sugar has reverted to the normal ranges and lovely no under a hundred milligrams per deciliter then you're not after a year you're not considered diabetic now you could easily jump right back into being diabetic you can you quit exercising and also went back to eating highly processed foods and lots of fat and sugar so you can move in and out of being diet being type 1 type 2 diabetic nice very nice so Betty who is watching again she says that she her parents weren't diabetic but that she's been diagnosed with pre-diabetes she says she's not vegan yet but she's fought some vegetables and so far has lost 27 pounds maybe you can tell Betty and everyone else watching what do we really need to eat to not only we our risk of diabetes but even reverse it what was her name it's a baby whose wedding yeah so Betty has done really really well to lose some weight that is very important it seems that when we have a lot of fat in our bodies a lot of fat cells that that has an impact on insulin resistance and you can turn that around if you lose some weight so that has an impact on our hormonal levels of various hormones so what what I'd like to do is to kind of go through the day and show what kinds of foods can really help I also share something with you AJ that like I'm actually not that disciplined when I'm working hard I I would eat things that are too sweet at the end of the day and all that kind of stuff so I went down to true north and I wanted to get to my optimal BMI and I went down twice and the first time I lost 14 pounds in the second time I lost 20 pounds and I did that by an amazing thing which was called water fasting and the and I found it not a terrible experience it was actually very pleasant so I went in in November of last year from one month I went and did water fasting for two weeks and then juice and a gradual reentry into food and so I found that it was a very very pleasant way to lose 20 pounds and then I followed up with that by eating a Whole Foods plant-based diet that is relatively low in fat doesn't have added sugars and is somewhat low and insult doesn't have added salty foods so that has allowed me to maintain the weight losses that I got in both cases like you can lose that weight and then you go zooming right back if you go back to your old leading so with our kick diabetes cookbook what we did was to show people through the day how to eat in a way that has very little no added sugar has some sweeteners like dates once in a while has uh we're frozen okay maybe you guys can tell me if you can still see or hear me vesanto is frozen right now you know a lot of people are using zoom I'm actually taking a class stand-up comedy class and an improv class with zoom and I'll tell you there's just been so many people using you see and hear me terrific Jeana I'll keep talking in the hosted listen art there you go don't worry when you freeze I'll just kind of do what they say in stand-up comedy I'll riff but welcome back so so many of us are using zoom and thank goodness for it yeah okay so what I'll do now is switch over and talk a little bit about what kinds of foods we need to eat and also I just want to mention that some communities and are really over represented by a lot of processed foods like like in some of the poorer communities they hardly have produce stores what they have is a lot of prepackaged stuff and and and also what's really convenient our convenience stores will those foods those stores do not have Whole Foods plant-based options so what we're finding is in certain certain population groups certain areas that there are many many processed foods and and these really aren't the ones we want we want Whole Foods plant-based absolutely I call it a plant exclusive because I'm not into having it just as the base I tell everybody I'm plant exclusive peace love vegan baby so talk about you know what it so what we need to eat to reduce our risk of diabetes whole food plant-based minimal to no salt and sugar definitely no oil didn't how can this book help people do that I actually saw there was a recipe for brownies in here for what for brownies they look beautiful yeah I mean the pictures of the pig are very beautiful in this yeah they are every recipe has a photo so that's always nice you know what it's supposed to look like lentil quinoa three sisters okay I'll go through some big thing look at this one yum okay have you I'm gonna try the cauliflower the the one that I showed at the beginning that's what I have the little page that's the first one I'm gonna try I just got this book a couple days ago and I'm gonna try the cauliflower recipe with the rice so this is our kick diabetes cookbook does that showing up it sure does it yeah so we did this book last year and we actually had a team of testers because I like to do books that are easy for people who can barely you know know how to how to stir a pot you know barely cook some simple things and also for people who are kind of gourmet and they really care you know what the ingredients are and have a lot of experience so we had some good recipe testers and we came out with with recipes that are relatively simple but also have a number of different variations and people can see some little clips of Brandon and I on our website the Kip diabetes cookbook calm and there are clips where we were talking recently just talking about the different recipes and ingredients so those are live little short videos just a few minutes and they can help people with a lot of things but if we go through the day then we'll see how we can for example start the day so how do you like to start your day savory with vegetables vegetables and starch sweet potatoes and broccoli that was that's good yeah so I have go between having smoothies the one today had kale and Eddin and you could have some a banana a bit of orange that kind of thing and I other days I'll have some kind of grain typically oats and not cooked but muesli so just add some things lots of some oh it's not not too many like just a quarter cup or something and add some berries and some seeds I usually use hemp seeds or chia to get some omega-3s which are actually important for diabetes so that can be a good way to start the day when I've had breakfast with Brenda Davis my co-author she usually has it like a salad bar so she's got all these different things and little jars and and they're all sitting in the fridge of the freezer and pulls them out so we have an art on our counter typically a few maybe raisins and almonds that you can just have a few if you need a snack like that but those are whole foods just so you know everyone out cuz TS asked I posted the Amazon link to the book if you'd like to click it you can check it out how did you start working with Brenda I mean obviously you're both in Canada but not in the same city and both dieticians did you was it just a match made by your publisher or were you guys friends and wanting to work together well I always had an event for John Robbins I had a little booth and this would be in that in the late 80s I think it was in the early 90s and I was showing I think I was doing cooking classes then because I had lived in India for four years and I realized that people in India really knew how to do plant-based diets although many of them are are too high in fats and gates so they are predisposed to diabetes when they eat that way but they also know how to make plant foods taste really good and they have a very healthy stream so when I came back from India I started helping both the public and also helping registered dietitians I am a registered dietician and have been for about 53 years now but I started helping my profession no colleagues learn how to use plant-based foods because we never learned that at school amazing I mean it's crazy but we don't learn that kind of thing it's it's becoming more and more popular more dieticians are getting interested in this but still we should be learning so much about prevention and instead we we tend to know a lot about medications and things like that you mentioned notes I'm just curious have you ever tasted oat groats oh yeah yeah and and and cook cook sometimes one of the different whole grains and he eat that way as the basis so I do that sometimes too and I really enjoy having an instant pot because then I can go and do other things and not worried that it's gonna boil over and you know burn and that sort of thing exactly Emily says that you're becoming vegan is classic and sends you a heart and Debbie wants to know if your cookbook can be useful for type 1 diabetics it is but it certainly can't get you entirely off insulin but it'll really change some of it'll it'll make your potential a lot better and it means that you won't go down the road to damage in different parts of your body as quickly or even move down that road like you can you can really maintain your health a lot better so this is is a value for people with type 1 diabetes oh and by the way then Brenda and I went together to a conference on nutrition plant-based nutrition in Washington DC and we had fun doing that and then came back and wrote to one publisher which was Macmillan and got the contract right away to do a book on becoming vegetarian and it was actually a vegan book nice Robert Cheeke has a question for you Vasant Oh have you seen your industry professionals embracing a plant-based diet is it catching on it is catching on I find a lot of young dietitians I'm probably contacted every week by young dietitians that want to go the same route I did now it unfortunately hasn't really taken over I mean we could be having very healthy food in hospitals instead of what we have so now we have a few hospitals that are going that route a few of the Adventist hospitals and dr. Neal Barnard Hospital in Washington DC but it still hasn't really taken over however I had a hip replacement about six years ago I had injured myself doing yoga back in the 80s and had a hip replacement and I went to the local hospital and asked for vegan food but I thought my husband would have to bring me stuff all the time I had really food so I was I was quite happy that more and more in even institutions are including vegan meals so dieticians are providing those and and the same in in the corrections facilities I'm a consultant for the prison system oh that's fascinating yeah we have vegan menus and they have in California or remember I've talked to different American professionals as well so it's coming along slow hey did you have any more slice to show because right now we can't see you only can see a slide oh I'm gonna show a few more so we do have a few things for example here's the some pancakes they're a little bit dense pancakes but you can use things with with ground flowers and carrot muffins so we do have a few baked items in our diabetes cookbook no I'll go on a little bit one of the things that I think is really important for us to do is to learn how to beans peas and lentils well because they will really help us maintain our blood sugar level and stabilize our blood sugar when our pancreas isn't that good at and maintaining a steady flow and what our brain functions on is glucose beans peas lentils are the ideal delivery of that so we wanted to get simple stuff so here were some hummuses that you see and instead of just having one kind we made all sorts of different ones that had beets in them or red pepper or different greens so any way we can make it kind of fun to have hummus when you're going to have that all the time you know that looks beautiful especially the red one yeah isn't that what I mean really really tasty and they don't have a lot of oil in them so they have the fats they have our tahini which is sesame seed butter but no added olive oil olive oil is thought to be a health food especially by the countries that produce it but it's actually better to use Whole Foods for your fast this is one curry in a hurry this is probably my favorite because you can make it in about 20 minutes and it it basically has three ingredients which is water and onions and red lentils and then you can add a few other things like tomatoes but red lentils cook in 15 minutes so this curry in a hurry is just wonderful and they make a big batch of it and freeze it oh and I use the tax curry paste so anyway it's it's really really delicious this kale salad is good it has orange ginger dressing and the one shown here has some some little sesame seeds on it but basically it has it's kale sliced matchstick thin and that makes it much more tasty you know having a big leaf of kale people go what am I supposed to do with this but during a piece of rubber but if you take the stem out and cut it matchstick thin it works very well and this is the one that you mentioned oh that was really that I'm gonna make that are you what's it called its called cauliflower best Maddie brace salad yeah that looks delicious so when I put the little post-it on yeah it's it it can be so daunting for people just start preparing food so what we want to do now know one of the things for diabetics is they don't want a whole lot of rice the whole plant foods such as cauliflower deliver glucose in a much more sustaining way without the big jumps in blood sugar did you find it yeah at some beach 94 and it only calls for one cup of cooked rice and compared to all the vegetables in it that's really not that much that's right so what we're doing when we use this whole foods plant based approach with type 2 diabetes or type 1 is to include a lot of vegetables really colorful and they deliver these protective antioxidants I also think this is a huge protection against coronavirus because your body has the ammunition that means needs to keep you healthy here's another fun one that's beautiful Yoshii frozen okay well hello everybody while we're waiting for her to come back I'm gonna answer the question about do they have what format does the book come in I saw this from somebody named pearl let me and I did look it up on Amazon and it does come in the the paperback copy that I have shown you and it also comes in P it comes in Kindle as well so you can find both on Amazon and I have been posting the link you back with sont oh yeah oh good good good cuz I've lots and lots of questions for you okay yeah there's a question do you have any thoughts on the diabetic Robbie from mindful diabetic he's a type one diabetes who eats a hundred percent raw diet of mostly fruit with Robbie and their yeah they're asking what you think of I maybe I don't know if they're asking what you think of Robbie personally or what you think of a hundred percent raw food diet of all fruit for diabetics a hundred percent raw can work okay it's it can be a challenge to get the protein up high enough but a hundred percent with high fruit I'm just not sure I don't think I'm not experienced with that being good but I found unfortunately it can taste wonderful and be great for a few months but then your protein iron and zinc start getting too low so it's it's better to what I think works a lot better is to have lots of fruits and vegetables be Huayra but include some beans peas lentils and I know I taught it a chef school in California that was entirely Brahe and then moved to be raw plus cooked and the end of that school sherry Soria would includes things like the sweet potatoes that we see here or and some beans and then it works really well things like corn can be wrong according the cob is delicious raw yeah it really is it doesn't really taste that much different no it's really good I've just got a few more slides moving into dessert now sure and then let me know when I can go back to the class yep and then we'll go back to so we've got the three sisters go green remember what the three sisters are corn beans and squash that's right yeah yeah so they were a really excellent healthy North American indigenous peoples' eating and then there's some sort of little burger patties there's a gravy this is one of my favorite things to have as an emergency when my blood sugar gets low bliss balls and these ones have lime in them and they just have dates nuts and I keep them in the bottom of my freezer so I'll just just have one or two and you know when when there's that sweet treat me or you can these they're made with basically this sort of ingredients now the black beans the the black bean brownies these were are actually a relevee adapted from joel fuhrman who's got some really good ideas so it's just fun that you can put beans into all kinds of things absolutely our last food slide is chia pudding because the omega-3s are really important for people and the sweetener here can be dates so anyway that's the end of my screen sharing I love that you use dates yeah and our web sites are the keep diabetes cookbook now I've been posting the link to your book on Amazon several times oh yeah your chia pudding laughs that looks real yeah isn't that good yeah oh gosh don't I have all the ingredients right now I could literally go make it right now it's simple as anything Wow I think I will make it but I'll wait until we're done talking so Robert wants to know what's the most interesting place you've been on tour you must have seen amazing parts of the world I have I'm just trying to get out of screen sharing we can see you now perfect oh you can oh good um I got I have had the privilege of going so many places to Dresden Germany where they had the first vegetarian conference in I think it was 1908 went for there hundred year anniversary I've been to Hawaii a number of times and to Italy where Cinque Terre but one of my favorite places was record so you would never think that people in reckon Vick would be going plant-based but I was quite surprised at there were a number of vegan restaurants but really cool scene sometimes rec if it doesn't get colder than Paris in January so it wasn't it wasn't quite what I expected in terms of coldness was actually lovely and because they have underwater like hot pools they have a lot of greenhouses so there were a lot of vegetables and fruits and people were very interested one of the people who started a Whole Foods type restaurant called glow had gone to the chef school that I attended so one of the fun things I find is that people all over the world aren't moving in this direction I mean of course some parts of the world already were very plant-based and didn't have the option of being as healthy plant-based as we North Americans and people in Europe have but it's really becoming a great interest in all kinds of places it was also fun to teach at that chef school which was very Whole Foods because there were people from the Philippines people from India that were going back to their countries to show here here's how to do this the foods you like but do them a real healthy way yeah I actually attended that school in 2003 and then we could have crossed paths sooner perhaps yeah that's right Betty wants to know if eating raw collard greens or kale can hurt the digestive system um it could be a little Oh kind of hard work if you don't take out the main stem and cut it matchstick thin I think for some people their digestion you know it's like it's like we have little variations and for some people they either don't chew it well enough or you've got this these great big pieces and your digestive tract just struggling for some people that's pretty normal to be putting down the greens like that so the trick is to take out the stem and then chop it matchstick thin and then you can use it in all sorts of things and of course what I had this morning with kale which I just picked from outside in my smoothie you know then it's ground up we also find that if you use something like that in a smoothie the absorption is greatly increased the absorption of phytochemicals of vitamins of minerals you just eat that absorption because you've broken up the cells and almost like started the digestive process in your blender yep well speaking of smoothies Gina has a question what can I do with tumeric other than put it in smoothies um I've got it in some salad dressings that make it a bright yellow color okay you've got some ideas AJ yeah well I like that there's a comment here from someone and I'll try to get on Jesse says that sorry Jesse I don't know if you're thinking your girl the way of spell I treat fresh turmeric like fresh ginger great or zest or microplane into soup stews veggies saut\u00e9s use it into your smoothies I do the same thing that when it's fresh I like if I'm doing a stirfry or any kind of vegetable its I do think of it very much like ginger and also I'll almost put both of them in if I'm doing it ginger garlic and too all fresh really good that's great yeah thank you you know in the powdered one I actually we were talking before we came on you arrest me how I'm doing with my concussion and I'm doing great and one of the things I actually saw the sure's eyes the vegan neurologists at Loma Linda and one of the things they told me is they wanted me to have turmeric every day it's supposed to be really good for inflammation and they told me to make like a little like milk I mean take a plant milk and put in some turmeric and put in some cinnamon and I get sweetener if I wanted it's actually pretty good you know Elle says or asks are there any negative effects of eating a few pounds of spinach daily well my husband cannot eat a few pounds of spinach daily because he has a tendency for kidney stones and spinach it has the presence of calcium but it's all bound up with oxalate so even though there's lots of calcium in there we don't absorb that calcium and we do end up with some oxalate which is like little prickly things when it goes into your body to make kidney stones now lots of us don't get kidney stones but those who have a tendency for that you should need to avoid foods that have high oxalates which include rhubarb spinach and beet greens and beets Wow and I think the beet green is the best part of the beet to be honest yeah so we're all good with that I can eat that but my husband would be better off not to because he just has that tendency like you know I think we need to eat healthy for different reasons and we have our Achilles heel in different places so his Achilles heels in the kidney stones area mine would be in the blood sugar diabeetus area yeah mine is in the anxiety area but it doesn't seem to make a difference unless I eat poorly so who in the plant-based world has influenced you the most who has influenced me the most if anyone Wow such a privilege you know I I told John Robbins one day that I admired him so much because you know there was this team of people that were changing the world and and he said well now you're on that team and I I just find that it's such a privilege that there are so many of us and a growing number that are getting good at different areas I mean you and TrueNorth people have been a tremendous influence that working with Brenda fer all these years I've been to Davis has been really fun for me to work with and and we've collaborated for 20 24 years now and still are friends you know and also keep learning from each other we can we can try out different things so I love that we can talk to other people like we talked to Michael Greger about what should be we be recommending specifically for b12 levels I've I found it a huge privilege to work with people in the American Dietetic Association and there is a vegetarian practice group there but we can bounce ideas off each other so I think the fun of it is that there are so many different people to inspires oh I know what else probably my dad and my mom because my dad was working with diabetes and physiology and my mom liked making healthy food for us so that was a good combo that's me Robert asked for the dietitians that are hesitant to adopt or recommend a plant-based diet where do you think the hesitation comes from um I think that a lot of health professionals just don't know enough about her in the practical level you know that dr. Michael clapper has been going around trying to get men Oh doctors to get interested in prevention but we don't necessarily learn that much about prevention in school I mean when I started writing our books it was in the 80s and and just before I met Brenda I was doing workshops I did one for dietitians and I was so nervous I spent six months getting ready and I I wasn't sure if anybody'd sign up this is in the 80s and I had actually 45 people sign up enough for six months of work I made $500 I was so thrilled that it even went through but it was just new for them people did not know we've learned all this theoretical stuff and we've learned our our workshops were hosted by insurer or the egg board even now there's still a big push like in California about beef and supporting the beef industry the egg industry so there's just not a practical familiarity but there is a strong vegetarian dietary practice group and I can if you have a website that's linked with this I can send you the link for it but there's usually about 1500 members who are dietitians if you give me that link I'll put anything you'd like this is live right now but then it's gonna be on YouTube forever so anything you'd like me to sing what's called the show notes please you know get that to me and I'll I'll insert that of course you know Colleen says you sound just like Brenda Davis and when you close your eyes you do you Bubo that you have very similar voices oh there's also a website about plant-based md's did I'll give you that link too and there's some dietician the plant-based Doc's org I believe it's right yeah L asks would you recommend something kale or chard in a morning smoothie for the spinach yeah I put I put kale in mine this morning and I just took the stem out but it was it's good I mean the blender just blends it up perfectly nice do you guys have any more questions for Vasant ODI I do have any new book you know you get 14 books is that how many you wrote I think it's 13 but yeah I'm doing another one on pregnancy eventually yeah Wow I think yeah that'll be very useful because a lot of people think you can't have plant-based pregnancies or even plant-based children but right now we have like our most popular one is can you see this yes becoming vegan I had it coming waking up and we did a raw book which I found quite fascinating to do was this was a with Brendan Davis as well but after teaching at that chef school I was fascinated with raw foods and we found that there were a number there was quite a bit of misinformation or things that weren't scientifically valid so we went over it in a lot of detail and that's what we put in our becoming Rob book that's the do you happen to know either Rick or Karen Dina oh yeah yeah they've come up and visited here and done workshops here yeah I think all of them in December when it was yeah they're great they're doing a summit right now you'd be great on it and I actually interviewed him last week it was almost 90 minutes he it's so much to say on the topic you smashing it about it okay and Ella saying that on the covers of your book you have beautiful artwork that is so true so am i read says do you like smoothies when so many of the plant-based doctors don't and I think it's mostly like dr. Esselstyn who's just trying to you know get the people to eat their greens yeah well we have to not have a one-size-fits-all we really you know some people I had a client this week that really want to do simple simple stuff and even chopping things up for a salad was way too much work so when you've got somebody like that you just help them at the place they are the best I can absolutely I agree Judy says what one book would you recommend my husband give to his endocrinologist and dietician to explain this way of eating he has diabetes and follows his doctor's recommendations instead of mine yes she says it's frustrating it's always frustrating when your husband doesn't listen to you especially when you're right yeah I know it is it is it is and I I don't know I don't tend to give people butts until they kind of want them I don't know if it'll work I think sometimes you can give somebody some food better than a book because if it tastes good don't go oh this is okay I could eat this once a year you know I could eat this once a month I could eat it once a week you know they get gradually gradually into it and if you you know the book that would be most helpful is our becoming vegan comprehensive Edition that's like for a health professional it's a college text as well but and there is a simpler version which is becoming vegan Express Edition but P if people aren't interested it's just gonna sit on their shelf so yeah I believe it's its dr. Barnard who said we're supposed to do something like you put a little post-it in and say this made me think of you so that they have to like read that page or something like that that's got real good ideas Disney yeah yeah yeah fantastic fantastic okay so a question on b12 from Lori do you recommend any supplements besides b12 I also recommend vitamin D and it's because partly because I'm in Canada so are where the northern latitude but we also find people in Los Angeles and San Diego are low in vitamin D in Arizona they're in lower latitudes but they're they have two challenges one is that there can be air pollution and that prevents the the solar enter coming through the ultraviolet B rays that we want and also people tend to get in their car drive into their carport drive to work they're not outdoors that much to get vitamin D and we've even had a research report from Honolulu which was based on skateboarders who were in their 20s who were outside for 27 hours a week and they still a number of them were low in vitamin D so we're not quite sure so I think a lot of people need vitamin D and we need that for bone health and we need it also it reduces our risk of cancer it has many many uses in the body then other than that I typically I do consultations with people and I wonder they get that was gonna be my next question how would they get in touch with you if they wanted to have a consultation oh ok in that one of the slides we showed has my email address it's it's my name vesanto melina at gmail.com and so I do distance consultations with people all over I've done them with some of the rock stars that are vegan as well and you know just with all sorts of people all over the place but I have people do a food record and then I do a nutritional analysis with a very good program that I have and then we figure out where the challenges are and tweak it and make it work well for them and I also show them ways to make it that fit their lifestyle very good yeah what vitamin D do you suggest and people need to know they can get their vitamin D and their b12 tested yeah usually like in in our medical system a lot of times it won't cover vitamin D and so but the vitamin D council has a quick and easy test or I just pay to get my mind down it's usually about sixty dollars or something like that but I've been really interested in it and I want to maintain my bone health as I get older and older and so I and another thing I found I was taking I have had asthma a little bit and I was taking symbicort a little bit but I found it in fact I think it affected my vitamin D level because when this is a puffer of like for asthma and so I stopped taking it but my vitamin D had gone down and anyway that was interesting because medications can affect things I don't take any medications now and I typically don't like to do and so that was an interesting thing so in summary you need b12 typically a thousand micrograms twice a week and vitamin D probably a thousand international units if you're young like in your 20s 30s 40s and double that if you're older like senior approaching that daily the the vitamin D is daily the b12 twice a week Colleen says women are always right while I'm not going to disagree with you because you're a woman and three wants to know what's your feelings about HRT for women post menopause um I am actually not sure I'd certainly chose not to do that and um it seemed to kind of mess with things but that would be somewhat more of a medical question you know depending on the person's actual situation as long as I don't like to avoid medications I don't blame you but as luck would have it guys if you come back tomorrow I'll be interviewing two doctors live tomorrow at 11 a.m. I have dr. Stephan s er and at 2 p.m. I have dr. Frank Sabatino so if you come back we'll be happy to ask those questions yeah good okay um you know so what's it like in Canada right now is are you sheltering at home as well yeah I'll tell you I live in Co housing and we have it would be like an Italian village we have three levels that some places are done to one level we have big courtyard every evening we go out at 7 o'clock and bang pots on the street for the health care workers and then at 7:05 we come in and I'll have two songs we all sing together so they're like stand by me or you've got a friend or they're both sunshine Eddie anyway they're really fun so we have people in our community like a bass player with the Vancouver Symphony and a couple of cello teachers so we have all these strings instruments come up and play and we we distance you know we keep very carefully maintaining the distance we spray our handrails and we're still having fun you know with with some connections and I'm finding there's actually some nice aspects to this I'm getting to know my neighbors from a distance but in different ways people have more time for each other we're going on long walks and allowed to be out in you know on the streets but people are very carefully actually Vancouver had the first death that I was aware of in North America back in I think February in a nursing home so we were careful right off the bat we were like yikes we better watch this and and that has worked very well I unfortunately I think a number of the states have not had that careful response but I'm finding it's probably going to turn out to be some nice things of this you know what we're learning from all the health professionals is that when you have a lifestyle disease like heart disease or diabetes which we know is not only preventable with a whole food plant-based diet but largely if not completely reversible you have increased your risk for this virus which is why you want to get books like kick diabetes cookbook so that you can have some delicious recipes and take control of your health destiny is available online as well it gives an e-book oh nice nice and this is another fun time to be preparing food yeah absolutely absolutely very much from a couple more questions and then I'll let you go so you can can to you to write your upcoming pregnancy but Florence wants to know is turmeric powder-- equally as effective as fresh toric well usually the general rule is that the fresh foods have additional protective substances in them that aren't there when it gets dried and powdered but I think some of these substances are there as well like you know turmeric or garlic they have a lot of health protective components and some of them get through the drying process and some don't but dried turmeric certainly has an advantage for as a health protective substance even when it's dried nice Debra wants to know do you recommend a vegan vitamin I'm wondering if she maybe means like a multivitamin yeah yes I think it depends what somebody's overall diet is now I don't recommend multivitamins as much as I did 10 years ago we've been kind of finding that backing off a little bit from suggesting them for everyday use and what I find is is it might be good to have one once or twice a week just to top yourself up but I only recommend that when I've looked at somebody's diet and see if they're holes in it you know if they're not getting enough zinc or they're not getting enough vitamin A or and then we try and fix it with food first I love that fix it with food first that'd be a great title for a book actually Carroll says what are your thoughts on Prolia since I have severe osteoporosis um I think yeah I'm just trying to remember I I had a client last week that had that and had done remarkably well with that but I don't think I know enough about it to give a good answer is that a medication I'm guessing yeah okay I know there's a great book on by joylynn ooh called something about this building bone vitality yeah yeah I would I was quite surprised that this client of mine had a bone building supplement and she had increased her bone density in in the last 20 years now I've maintained my bone density and how I did that was by three things making sure again enough calcium like up so that was like taking a calcium supplement that was about 250 or 300 milligrams about two different times in the day taking vitamin D I'm now about 2,000 international units and getting weight-bearing exercise good and that combo sugar plum asks do you eat some type of seaweed or nori to get your iron iron I'm or maybe iodized salt no did she freeze again I think when I have people that are farther away we seem to have more problems so if we don't get her back then you could have a consult I put her email address and you can also ask the doctors tomorrow we'll be having Frank Sabatino at 2:00 p.m. this is Pacific time and at 11:00 a.m. dr. Esser are you back to Santo oh my god I can't hear you recommend the very specifics in our different books you know the becoming vegan and so on and give the different options and how much the only challenge with seaweeds is we don't often know how much iodine is in there so I found the iodine i diced selten I use a little bit of salt so there are different options for people iodine supplements can give you too much but if you if you use the wrong amount because iodine can be toxic and excess oh my I just ate something called dull sand yeah it tastes pretty good so it was smoked Dolson I take it when I think of it because like you say get it from food if you can yeah I tried to do Florence says I recently started using nutmeg and I heard that I need to be careful when using it are there any dangers in using nutmeg oh I can't remember what it is for nutmeg it's it's got something on it I never liked it getting into trouble I did sometimes it's bitter nutmeg yeah I'm gonna google it really quick and see if I'm good figures your memory dangers of nutmeg just ask dr. Google here toxic doses of Mira's dissin have caused organ failure whoo I mean like it's so straight vegan Bella's saying not make as high as toxic and high doses it's so potent that I if I do use it a recipe it's like 1/8 of a teaspoon it's they're mammals yeah yeah yeah this has been just so it's just so lovely catching up with you this is a beautiful book I encourage you guys to check it out I'll post one last time the link on Amazon so you can check it out and if you come back on Wednesday April 22nd the co-author of this book brenda davis will also be talking about diabetes and if you want a private consultation i posted vesanto this email and then she can work with you individually as well so thank you so much for all the wonderful books you've written and continue to write and just for being just such a shining light and the plant-based world in Canada Oh Thank You AJ yeah oh I'm I'm lead author of the position paper on vegetarian nutrition do for the American Dietetic Association is there a way we can see that paper when you provide me with all the links in the show notes maybe with that website link but I'll send it to you yes website has a link to that position paper thank you it's a really good summary so you can show your doctor or your baby clinic or anybody this is approved it's a good way of eating it's might be easier for them to read than a whole book

great summer so far and thanks for watching I'm super excited to share some really cool products that I'm enjoying here at the end of June headed into early July and I want to get started right away first off it's cherry season dark sweet cherries from the Pacific Northwest are in peak season California season was such a dud because the weather but man they're there back with the fresh crop Washington fruit beautiful hmm rich flavor in the dark sweet cherries look for a bag that has no wetness on the bottom you're looking for no splits and cracks or any evidence of damage or decay and the bear and cherry should feel fairly firm keep them refrigerated rinse before eating and yes you can freeze them right in the bag and enjoy them later another cherry that I'm like super excited about this is this is some really good stuff there's Rainier cherries we'll talk about those in another video sometime but this is a similar to a Rainier cherry it's called the skylar ray and from just a milk and the skylar ray variety is firm crisp and just has a super intense sweetness they're marketing these as the sweetest chair you'll ever eat nice balance of acidity and that is that is a really good sweet cherry hmm this won't be the cheapest but this may be one of the best cherries that you'll try Skyler race look for him this summer next let's hop over to grapes everyone's talking about the cotton candy grapes yes they really do have a mild aftertaste it reminds of oh hey that's the flavor of cotton candy no they're not genetically modified no they're not dipped in anything no they're not injected with anything this is just a cultivar that lots of plant breeders are always looking for that next great variety of grape and lots of other produce and so this was one that emerged and boy it didn't really look great a lot of grapes would fall off the stems pretty easily but once it once they were tasted somebody said I reminds me of cotton candy and oh it's been a super popular grape ever since they're green seedless super sugary medium crispness hmm it's not going to be a cheap grade but wow it does really have this flavor it reminds you of cotton candy another interesting Greg you'll find this time of year is the sweet sapphire it's an elongated variety of black grape seedless it's long and cylindrical it's a really cool grape it has a rich flavor rich sweetness and a nice crisp crispness and they are just really cool to look at and the last grape I want to talk about this you won't find everywhere but it's starting to be available they're called candy snaps and oops I have washed bunch right here there's a small red seedless a good crisp pop and this kind of berry flavor like a strawberry aftertaste again intensely sweet that's that might be an up-and-comer so cotton candies and sweets a Fire's in season from the sonora region of Mexico during June and parts of July and they're available both conventionally and organically the organic cotton candy are in a blue bag the conventional and a pink bag and the sweet sapphires just look for that branding there you can't miss those long black grapes and lastly for peak season value and for me a local piece of fruit is New Jersey blueberries New Jersey blueberries our peak season they are gonna be rocking here in late June and through mid July this is or an organic blueberry I've had the opportunity to be at that farm no special varieties these are the old-fashioned blueberry varieties they've been grown in New Jersey for decades and you can expect decent berry size they're not going to be as firm as some of the new varieties but man it's just a good New Jersey blueberry hmm put them on your cereal you yogurt Bank with them freeze them it's summer and blueberry season thanks for watching stay tuned for more videos appreciated [Music]", "VM5sVGW05_k": "what happens to your body when you eat grapes as far as healthy snacks go it doesn't get much better than grapes they're super

guys a really quick easy healthy yummy recipe this is almost it's so simple that I feel kind of silly even doing a video on it but I feel like you know if you guys don't know about this and you are wanting some more healthy snack ideas this is a really good one to add to your pile because these are really really delicious and so what today is just some candied frozen grapes and all you need for this is some grapes which I have mine right here you just want to rinse them good and I have them in my little colander and then I just let them dry a little bit yeah but you still want them to be slightly wet so don't try them completely and then in this bowl you can use any flavor of jell-o that you would like but I have found that I like the blue raspberry or berry jell-o is the best with these and I also really like it the best with green grapes but you can experiment and see what you like the best so then you're just gonna pour some of your grapes once you have your grapes in your jello make sure you're just going to roll them around and get them all covered in the mixture and then you're going to put them in a ziploc bag or an airtight container and put them in your freezer and then you can just munch on them and they're super good this is what they look like when they're all ready to go in the freezer they're just lightly covered with the jello powder and then like I said you just stick them in the freezer and let them freeze so you want to let them freeze for at least a few hours if not overnight and then you can just munch on them and they're really good they taste like candy and Colton wants them but they're not frozen yet so I hope you guys enjoy this if you try it", "QHvP5l9-VyQ": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "Ka5NDyMtMmU": "um [Music] bye", "R6EQKvJrE5w": "hi have you been searching for this product or service we've got solutions to suit your needs at

oh video yeah okay so first let's start off with the gummy bear i i don't really eat gummy bears but i don't love them i ate some yesterday because my mom gave me some so i'm gonna eat one and see so i'm gonna eat the red kind i haven't eat the red kind okay these are different flavors so for the green packet it says strawberry from the red back on red one it says raspberry there's no way that's

guys liked it and peace bye hold up you guys got to say bye to gummy bears gummy bears gummy bears", "1BviwB6i-RM": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm dr. Phil via a general practitioner and writer and this is Africa where health where we provide you with direction and clarity about everything medical the measures to manage cycle cell anemia the inherited condition that affects hemoglobin in the blood which can cause significant illness have evolved over several years in this video we're looking at the current that is the most recent updates for potential cures we have available in 2020 now for several years a cure for sickle cell anemia has been largely elusive in places like Nigeria and West Africa the country that has the highest burden for sickle cell anemia people hardly talk about a cure for the disease and people who suffer with sickle cell anemia resigned themselves with prevention as much as they can sickle cell crisis and taking treatments that can promote their health as much as possible however for some years now there has been a cure but it has been mostly available in high-income countries where there are adequate facilities and effective health came from structure to manage the process of delivering the cure and maintaining people's health afterwards what kyoto called stem cell transplant has developed challenges in terms of its use and administration and so a lot more recently within the last six months a new alternative has developed known as gene therapy we're going to talk about both of them but start with stem cell therapy stem cell therapy in sickle cell anemia requires that the individual with sickle cell anemia who is going to undergo treatment has a healthy brother or sister from whom stem cells can be taken or harvested in order for the procedure to be carried out now stem cells are particular types of human cells that can develop into many other types of human cells for example muscle cells or brain cells or bone cells how do we get them cells there are two main sources first human embryos some human stem cells are produced from the embryos that is immature fetuses during in-vitro fertilization and donated to science other stem cells can be formed from fully developed adult cells the critical thing about stem cell is their ability to develop into other types of cells inside the body so essentially in stem cell therapy for sickle cell anemia it is thought that the healthy cells taken from the donors bone marrow will be transplanted into the recipient and developed into non sickle cells red cells within the recipient the person who's suffering from sickle cell anemia the like I mentioned earlier there are some challenges with stem cell therapy one of the problems is that many people with sickle cell anemia do not have a healthy relative or healthy sibling brother sister who can act as a donor for normal or healthy stem cells to be harvested from the other problem that could happen is that they may develop serious complications following the transplant assuming they're able to get his sibling donor there may be serious complications after the chance but all the transplants may fail and the finished stem cells stem cell science is still evolving is still developing they still in lots for scientists to learn about techniques which with which the stem cells can be controlled and used appropriately the way you want to for the benefits of of science of medicine and there's also also the issue that some people find it troubling use stem cells obtained from embryos that are not used after cycles of IVF but an alternative solution has come up and this is gene therapy in gene therapy for sickle cell anemia it is the patient the person who suffers from sickle cell anemia it's their own stem cell that I used so removing the need for a compatible donor now to understand how this works we need to digress a little bit and talk about the role of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease now fetal hemoglobin or hemoglobin efforts we also call it is unique for quite a few reasons number one it appears to be very well-suited for supporting or maintaining the baby within the wounds low oxygen environment compared to normal or healthy adult hemoglobin researchers have also found that the presence of fetal hemoglobin prevents the formation of the cold red blood cells now after birth and as they developed infants or young babies gradually stop producing this fetal hemoglobin and instead start to develop what is MV an adult hemoglobin the hemoglobin that they will eventually continue with us and all the children and as adults for the rest of their lives now this process where they stop producing hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin starts or tends to happen from about four to six months age so what you find is that from about forty six months of age in children with normal immigrating genotype the hemoglobin F will be replaced by hemoglobin a but in a child with the SS genotype the hemoglobin F is going to be replaced by hemoglobin s that causes the cleaner of the red blood cells now the crux of gene therapy and this is research that's still ongoing with clinical trials that are presently going on at the Boston Children's Hospital in the United States this research has shown that the production of fetal hemoglobin can be reactivated which in the case of an individual with sickle-cell disease will be first the condition now the scientists working on this belief that this process can be reversed by the activity or or suppressing or preventing the activity of the of a protein called be the L 11a and so what they do is they use an inactive virus to deliver instructions genetic instructions to the RNA of the red blood cell of the person the individual with sickle-cell disease and these instructions are meant to drastically reduce the production of this protein bcl11a in the individuals red blood cells and this is what allows the reversal from the adult hemoglobin in that individual to the feats of hemoglobin okay so it's a lot more complicated than what I've just said and clinical trials are going on the process is underway there are if they're described as promising they're individuals who have received these treatments and they're promising resource and if you want to read more about sage and find out more details I will put a link to the Pape and E and research studies in the description box below so please are the measures available for people who ask what is they care is their care for sickle cell anemia these are the measures available to consider in terms of cost accessibility availability they are technical highly specialized procedures that have still been looked into in high-income countries and the United States so the feasibility of having them performed in lower middle-income countries of course can be quite challenging but they are fair as an option and possibly in the next decade or less maybe more available to other parts of the world so let's watch this faith now if you are interested in a 7-point checklist for what people with the a s genetic short considered when the ancient relationship is all generally should be aware of about their health care status make sure you check the link in the description below because I got a free II leaflets on that particular topic now next time in this series are going to be looking at the treatment available for sickle cell anemia understanding the treatment of sickle cell anemia so what drugs to people the sickle cell anemia need and when they are having a crisis or just to maintain their health generally and why do they need this medication so make sure you check out that video could put the link
