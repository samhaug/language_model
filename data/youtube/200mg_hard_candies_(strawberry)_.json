{"348s5l3DjQo": "[Music] hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida i'm greg this is our first video of 2021 and i don't know what your plans are but nothing is going to stop me from making 2021 a great year for lofty pursuits and i hope that means it's going to be a great year for you too we're going to capture the flavor of chocolate covered strawberries chocolate-covered strawberries are kind of unique because we know exactly who invented them lorraine larusso and she did it in the 1960s and we'll get to that at the end as i mentioned this will be part of our image candy assortment for valentine's day it's available at www.pd.net and here's the full 2021 assortment what we're going to do now is add the food coloring and if you take a look as i stir it in you're going to see the steam start coming off you know that's because the food coloring is water-based and the candy may look like a liquid but has no water in it and this is how we're going to build their palettes we're going to have a red section which is of course going to be the strawberry and in this case also the outside wrap we're also going to have a little bit of trouble today it's a cold day in tallahassee and i know those of you up north are going to think florida coal well the inside of the store right now is about 67 degrees and that's giving us some trouble the candy's cooling faster than i'd like it to so this is going to be a bit of a rush the entire time we're going to see how that goes and yellow is going to be used for the background fortunately yellow a little yellow goes a very long way we always use yellow for the background because it also lets us use it for the yellow seeds of the strawberry we're going to the brown which we're also going to use on the wrap don't need very much of that you'll notice the top layer of candy is getting a little hard it's getting a little hard to work but it's still boiling out and we're still getting a lot of steam it's been a long time since i made a batch of candy just by myself this should be interesting candy's just the right temperature i didn't wait too long there you go now i'm going to cut our candy into it the palace the stop light of color here we've got the brown and this part over here cooled a little bit much so rather than fight it and take most of it off put it in here it'll reheat there i can do the same thing with the green maybe i can save a bit of the edge of this now i got too much green on the edge i'll just use it all now to go for the red if i got the temperature right it won't stick too badly to the table well that's just perfect i can keep everything apart but i didn't succeed on everything apparently came apart good so this green can do the same thing let's see how fast everything's cooling i'm not getting the drips i normally do which i kind of have to do i'm doing this on a hot summer day it's the only way to aerate the candy enough to cool it off now that the sugar is evening out there's no real cold places that i can find to put the sugar or put my hands on so i don't get burned [Music] [Music] if you'd like to try this candy for yourself please visit our website at www.bd.net [Music] [Music] so every time i pull this and fold it over i'm trapping air bubbles into the candy this is really useful for me because it's like setting up little mirrors inside the candy and every time i do that it reflects more light that means it's going to bounce the light out of the red and it's going to make it look a little more jewel-like and that's the goal here to make this more jewel-like and it also creates more surface area in the candy and uh that means that the candy dissolves a little which is good because it makes the flavor more intense [Music] the first thing i'm going to do i'm going to make the strawberry frond the strawberry friend's gonna be sort of like half of a citrus if you've seen our citrus video three i think i'm gonna have four little green prawns so this is my heating table and different parts are heated to different amounts so i'm moving it around so let it cool off but not cool off too much got to make sure that the green edges touch each other [Music] [Music] and that'll be the top of the strawberry bread we need some more yellow we're going to need less yellow than the red by a substantial amount because these are going to be the seeds i don't even need less than that this area is going to be the wrap for the seeds and the body of the strawberry and normally i make 10 little strawberry cells and i'm going to make fewer this time [Music] because i'm making fewer because i'm going to be making the i'm going to be making pewter because i'm making the chocolate bit too and will be part of the same triangle so i'm going to end up doing seven of these little things so this will end up being four and that'll end up being three two three four the center of each of these is going to be yellow giving that little strawberry seed and this will be in thirds i'll do one two three i'll get the brown and i'll start pulling cylinders off this lots of leftover brown i guess it doesn't really have to be a cylinder but it definitely lets me measure the amount of candy in my head better there we go just like that one of the problems with the green is i always have to make too much so i'm not going to use nearly all of this the patron is never as wide as a strawberry but don't worry much of this can be saved and used for the stripe the noise you just heard with me turning on the batch roller it's a little squeaky today gonna have to lube it after all this is done a little bit of red isn't going to be a problem because we're going to put it right against the red from the strawberry or the brown and it's not ever going to be noticed [Music] there we go now all we have to do is do the outer wrap and in the meantime i'm going to put this on the batch roller let it spin for a few minutes but i don't let it go flat so now we get to see how soft these things still are they're plenty soft so we're going to be able to use these as stripes and you may wonder why we don't do much audio here live audio here the noises like that squeaking is definitely part of it also the noises from the customers are part of it because we can't use that audio according to youtube but today it's raining and we have no customers so we're not going to have that problem [Music] yeah approximately approximated the size very very close now i've got my log chocolate covered strawberry [Music] and off to the batch roller so so [Music] if you think about it chocolate covered strawberries are different than other chocolate covered fruits chocolate-covered orange peels are preserved orange peels chocolate-covered cherries are preserved too but chocolate-covered strawberries are fresh and they trace their roots back to the imagination of lorraine larusso a candy maker from a candy maker's family in chicago who was working at a grocery store that had a large candy section the cool thing about this story is i don't have to tell it to you even though lorraine passed away in 2014 she can tell her own story the produce department was right next to my candy department and ralph who was a manager used to get these driscoll strawberries from california i said you know i got a good idea we'll set up a display and we'll dip strawberries for mother's day and it became such a success and 25 hours is selling with an investment of only 700. i had a return of over 3 dollars we took the lag of candy and we drew it down into rods of candy and now we have to cut them into individual bite-sized pieces for the final assortment and we do that on our canvas if you're interested in hearing more about lofty pursuits please check out our other videos we also have a weekly or roughly weekly podcast that you can get wherever podcasts are available or off our website www.pd.net it's very different from the videos because i don't limit myself to candy do and now to see how our chocolate covered strawberry came out i really wish we could put the smells across on youtube too the smell of this candy being made was so much like a chocolate covered strawberry you could almost imagine biting into it in juice running down your fingers thank you for watching we appreciate it if you want to try this candy for yourself please go to www.pd.net you can get the candy there you can also follow us on facebook twitter and instagram and remember to subscribe to us here on youtube and to ring the bell so that you get notifications if you ever come to tallahassee we're right up the thomasville exit off i-10 we make the candy in the front of the store and we make

"hey guys today we're making a delicious\ntreats called Tanghulu essentially it's fresh fruit\ncoated in crunchy caramel the combination of the juicy fruit with the\nhard candy is incredible I'm using strawberries today because it's my\nfavorite fruit to use if you've never tried this\nyou'll be obsessed so we're essentially making caramel so please be careful if\nyou're a kid get an adult to help you out do not make this alone to a sauce pan\nyou're going to add the sugar and some water and I also like to add some honey\nfor flavor your pan should be over low heat do not stir this mixture or it may\ncrystallize you can however gently swirl the pan and as soon as the majority of\nsugar has dissolved into the water you can turn your flame to medium and bring\nthis to a boil if you're new to my channel make sure to subscribe and click\nthat bell I post new videos every week now if you have a thermometer you want\nthe temperature to reach a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius or three hundred F also known as the hard crack stage on your thermometer this is going to\ntake anywhere between eight to ten minutes it really depends on your flame\nnow if you don't have a thermometer what you can do is cook this to a slightly\nand I mean slightly higher temperature and you'll know it's ready because the\nmixture will turn a slight amber color at this point turn off your flame\nimmediately or the sugar will burn and taste better I like to add one or two\ndrops of red food coloring and you'll see why in just a moment you're going to\ndip your strawberries into the mixture using a wooden skewer and swirl the\nberries to coat them completely and you're going to place these onto some\nparchment paper to cool now this is why I like to add red food coloring because\nif you have some strawberries that have some green bits such as this one when\nyou coat them in the mixture they'll turn a vibrant red so no matter how the\nstrawberries look guys always turn a beautiful red the\nstrawberries will harden pretty quickly but just to be safe\nwait at least 10 minutes before you eat these not only are these delicious guys\nbut there's so much fun to eat and there's really a handful of foods guys\nyou can say that about okay the hot syrup basically softens the berries so\nwhen you bite into it you get this crunchy candy Syria but that juicy berry\nthat just explodes with delicious notes it's a very unique and amazing texture\nthat you'll only fully understand if you make eat", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for the feedback on that video it was number one trending for a little bit boys

live recording if you are new to my channel don't forget to hit that subscribe button and then notification bell to let you know that another great video is on and we're gonna get started on how to dip how to properly dip candy strawberries in this video session I will break away and do a Q & A after I have gone through the steps and techniques and methods for this particular video alright so don't forget to give this video thumbs up leave a comment in the comment section let me know how you enjoyed this video and we're gonna go ahead and get started so what I'm going to discuss with you first is what am i what am i using to dip my strawberries first I got some fresh strawberries and I have some paper towel to completely dry my strawberries they must be completely dry and I'm going to use the half recipe 2 cups of sugar 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of light corn syrup I have my bamboo scores which these are 6 inches long and they're like 4 inches 4 inches in width so either you get 6 inches or 8 inches long this is to better help with dipping so you won't have to stick your hand all the way into in the pot dipping these strawberries okay safety first safety first all right and so I'm also going to demonstrate a few things with the i'ma show you the original dipping then I'm going to add color and then I'm going to do some sour candied strawberries all right so I put in a little mixture of some of my Jolly Rancher mix and just mix them together and we're gonna get started so let's go ahead and add our 1/2 cup of water 2 cups of granulated sugar 1/2 cup of light corn syrup all right get that all mixed up in there now I'm not gonna add any color because I am getting I'm going to create the original candy strawberries first all right so you want to cook this same as you do candy recipe for apples you want to cook this to 300 degrees this is a half recipe okay mix that all in there now here's a trick with the candy strawberries all right using a Half Men half recipe this is the thing of understanding recipes if you want to thin out your candy add a little bit more water okay if you want to add 2 more tablespoons of water or 4 table tablespoons of water to thin it out your mixture or you can add 3/4 cup or another 1/2 cup and the all it does is then out the mixture so that it won't be so hard on your candy strawberries all right and then when you add more water then you have to take it up to 310 degrees all right so that is a tip for you all today taking my candy thermometer placing it in the pot making sure the tip does not touch the bottom of the pot or it will give off a first reading and I'm going to put this disclaimer up there as soon as I turn this induction oven on it maybe some static but it will soon go away let's get that on [Music] okay so you want to put this on medium-high heat making your candy apple recipe and no color goes in just get the clearance of this particular candy strawberry okay some people average some people don't but you'll see what I'm talking about once it's time to dip so you want to make sure that your strawberries are completely dry taking you a nice paper towel oh you're here to set it for this soon go away I know that that after I went back to watch the video all right so make sure that you dry your strawberries completely what I clean my strawberries went is a vegetable wash and I will put the description the link in the description below but make sure that all your strawberries are completely clean all right so I'm just dabbing my strawberries and while I'm doing that I'm going right into our Q&A segment so here we go feel free to ask your questions let's get it into this and go hi everyone [Music] [Music] very great question being that this these are fresh fruit any fresh fruits that you dip does not last long at all strawberries grapes these does not last no longer than two to three days two to three days is the longest that these are going to last because a lot fresh fruit a lot of fresh fruit cannot be dipped okay it doesn't last long at all two to three days tops no longer than that if anyone wish to purchase from you any fresh fruit you must they must get them that same day or within the three days I wouldn't recommend shipping because they break down even with chocolate-covered strawberries they don't last long at all best way to store them this look this winter storm if you put them in a container a cupcake container whatever little small box container you want to serve to your customer it's totally up to you and you store them right into the refrigerator you're welcome someone see me live and they're live in the video if you see if you're in here and you lie please refrain from inboxing me I am doing a live video thank you is this recipe is this the same recipe as candy apples yes I use this my same recipe I just took the recipe a half just the half recipe if you want to thin off the candy I would advise if you add at least four tablespoons of water or you can do a half cup more of water all you do is just turn it off the mixture and you can cook it to 310 degrees at that point because remember water breaks down sugar so it's safe to add a couple more tablespoons of water to thin out your mission how do you make it grow what is your Jolly Ranchers sour me I'm glad you asked it is a video on my channel that I did some candy grapes but all I mix is and here are a few of my colors I do something a little different I mix Jolly Ranchers and sanding sugar and citric acid into this mix okay the center assets you can order offline you can get at your local Walmart and actually this is just a total mix of pictured ethic and sugar I mixed the citric acid and sugar I do have up in half so this is gonna be very sour and sweet and then I just spread them into my Jolly Rancher mix okay so that's Jolly Rancher mix grind it up playing a full full processor or blender standard sugar your citric acid and a little bit of sugar shake it up and wallah now I gotta break this up but I have green blue orange and yellow and you can make whatever color you want to make with the Jolly Ranchers and all I did was took some took a few tablespoons and mix this together to just blend it all together all right so this is actually like a sour mix and if you don't want it to be soft where you don't have to add the citric acid okay to blend to blend down the four grind up the Jolly Ranchers you can use a food processor or a blender and once you grind down the Jolly Ranchers and I want to you I unwrapped $25 Ranchers and mix them into the blender so you can do more or whatever you choose depending on how big your blender is I use the hand blender so I counted out 25 so I wouldn't tear up my blender thank you can you also use this Jolly Rancher mix on candy apples yes you sure can long as the candy long as your candy apples like you like you do with sand and sugar I will take my Apple put it over the heat let some heat boil or what-have-you put your Apple right over there the steam from the pot let your apples get sticky and then you can just dip your apples into a bowl of the Jolly Rancher mix and you can coat it that way now I don't know who long eat that have a police um buddy gotta really have a good dentist they were good Dennis plan to be eating that Apple end of Jolly Ranchers on them on that Apple alright alright so I'm there checking your thermometer put it in a glass container with water okay [Music] and I just want you to take a look at how your mixture turns brown okay so I'm gonna use two of these sticks for my strawberries piercing right at the top okay you don't have to go all the way through not normally I take the leaves off okay I'm not trying to burn my fingertips trying to hold the leaves while I dip them I take them off okay all right so this is the original way to coat for the candy strawberry if you just to coat it with just the mixture all right you can flavor the mixture if you like I'm just gonna scrape that there okay so as you see here now I'm going to also show you flavoring at the end it's not a problem it's going to bubble a little bit if it's smoked that's fine just mix it in there you can see the smoke come up don't be a line let it settle all right and you can also add your flavor around to 200 to 250 I'm just showing you all the difference of what the outcome would be if you forget to add your flavor once again taking your sticks piercing them into your strawberry now this time I'm going to add a little bit of red this is a super red by Chef Masters just adding one drop okay you do not have to add white okay unless you want your candy strawberries to be a solid color all right so if you ever seen candy strawberries and you can still see through the candy and it looks really really pretty this is the way to do it just don't add white just add the red color all right it's gonna look transparent and that's the look you want if you want the red delicious candy strawberry tilting your pot dipping it right in coming out kind of Kitsch step okay I'm going to sit this down and i'ma show you in a few all right now with this strawberry I'm going to dip into the Jolly Rancher mix let that drizzle off I know I'm definitely not gonna put my hand behind there so you can see okay you want to dip in your mix just dip into the mix s oh all right and that's how you make your candy strawberries pretty cool huh also leave a comment in the comment section if you have done this before you left your leaves on would you rather leave your leaves on or take them off my preference is take them off okay then I'll show you all of them in a few there's some that off strain it to mix okay these are fairly large strawberries I've got my strawberries from Sam's Club I always like to aim for the bigger strawberries the bigger the better and this one I'm just going to dip originally and that's why I feel is so much better and safer to have longer sticks to dip your strawberries with all right very pretty vibrant now if you want it to look solid then you add white but this is how you would do that classic red candy strawberry okay just sit it down onto a silicon mat and then this is the original just original dip strawberry right into the sugar nothing at it you can add flavor but it doesn't have no color it's just the candied mix okay so this is the original and this is the original classic red okay and remember they do not last long okay it all look very pretty and there you have your candy strawberries any questions you can't reheat this mix just pay attention that you don't overheat okay did you see it slowly getting a little thick let me just turn it up you want to turn your stove on low to just heat it up a little bit to continue to dip okay but to remember to pet that strawberry completely dry before dipping okay so you see the mix heating back up just takes a few minutes for it to get so then out once it has the net [Music] let me just go in and do [Music] [Music] and don't reheat it too long it just takes a few minutes if it if you reheat it longer than that it goes into a taffy so remember you're working with a homemade hot mix okay just sit that down all right to clean out your pot just add you a cup of water bringing it over the level you want to put enough water in there where it goes over level of the candy mixture and just boil it out until it comes a liquid form and you are good you are set with your mixture and just clean out your pot but there you have your candied strawberries okay so I'll take a few questions before I sign out you welcome I hope you all are enjoying this series I think you all are if you're not following me on my social media I am on

some great videos is about to come on and girl you know raw was about to come and give you life for show alright excuse the interruptions earlier that's the thing about going live but can I cut one in half I sure can there you go remember the tire candy hmm got me smacking okay there you go hmm someone asked can they do cherries I wouldn't do cherries and I'm really I'm really here to educate y'all to let y'all know everything cannot be dipped in candy mixture the lifespan does not last long so if you're looking to do like a pop-up shop and you're trying to get them up out of there you selling the same day they need to come and pick them up that day or within two to three days okay I did my daughter's pink party and I did candy grapes and they fell in love with them which the high schoolers always do and they ate them that same day you know they got up the next day looking for him but remember fresh fruit whether it's plums peaches they were peaches gotta look more tough skin but plums grapes strawberries they're fresh fruit so cherries yeah I mean you can dip them but just know they're not gonna last exactly someone said now I see why you say who gonna eat the apple with the candy mixture it's hard yeah you put hard candy on top of hard candy keep in mind this is a home made mixture things are a little different when you make it homemade you can store them in your refrigerator for them to last up until the time that your customers or your family who ever come and get them how would I price them it varies by these strawberries being as big as they are I do three of these for five dollars they're huge okay and it depends on your area okay some may sell a little more for five dollars that makes sell six for five dollars but that's how we price them so just keep in mind what may work in my area may not what mark is in my area may not market in your area so pricing is a little different over brought abroad just could I do fruity pebbles alright cereal on candy Chattanooga has everybody okay someone eggs how do you package these you can package them and whatever clear container you can put them in cupcake liners and put them in a cupcake container and put them in a refrigerator it depends on the packaging that you choose to put them in depending on the size of the strawberries but me per say I will probably put them in a cupcake container or there's a container that I did do my strawberries in that fits like four in the container I will leave that link in the description box below check out that link and they're good to hold strawberries it's a clear container just put them in and sell them in that container oh my goodness candy peaches we'll see no I do not leave the sticks in at all nope I do not need the sticks in so you don't need to stick then they come right out as you see okay no I do not leave the sticks in check them out please don't settle with the sticks in that don't look right okay all right so this will end my session for

into a bowl so it the highest and just Wayne to employ those should we mix it until it reaches okay then turn the hard crack stage that's what's it's okay so I'm gonna trim the heat to the low setting I think we just need to wait for it to boil because we don't have that Canada tomorrow I don't want to bottom because it'll just lace and linking the sauce yes [Music] [Music] here's a little bridge because we're not going to eat it a minute immediately so yeah let's just ate one hour just kidding it's just my like 30 minutes or something hey guys so we just took it out of the freezer and it's

amazing day and two toes Cheetos bye [Music] you", "lQ_d1FNelTQ": "okay and today's tutorial we're gonna be doing candid strawberries and I've been getting tons of requests for these so I figured I'd go ahead and make the video but I'm trying to make this video short sweet and to the point so you're gonna be just try there's of course one in one cup of sugar 1/4 cup of water 1/2 cup of kale Oh sir you know twist ties and your bamboo stores and these are going to go inside the strawberries I mean because you don't want that I came to get on your fingers opinions came back I know I don't but um as soon as I get all the ingredients into the pot I'll be back to show you also apply the sticks and twist ties ok now that I got my mix on the stove I'm gonna let it go to 300 just like you would do candy apples and I have my stove on between 6 and 7 okay you're gonna take your berries I'm gonna put the stories high s so you're gonna take two leaves just in your twist tie and you're just gonna twist it on and so so I do that this way because when I'm dipping I don't want the candy all on my arm skin or whatever that's not cute so you're taking when you dip them it'll be so much easier so we're gonna get all those stuck and twist tight on me take it put it back this time you just twist it on take it pull up take your twist I just twist it on okay I'm gonna get all those done Pope you're tired or whatever and I'll be back when my mic's reached 300 okay now that I have got all of them talked with the vampers doors and twist hide I'm waiting on my mixer reach 300 which is already almost at 300 but before I call that I want to give you the ingredients again because I think I said I'm wrong in the beginning but it's 1 and 1/2 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of Cairo and 1/4 cup of water and you can flavor it if you want to use the dreams of the Lorien flavor enormous or you can use just that I got from Walmart I mean so each is own it what you want to pay for yours with I mean you don't have to play with him at all when you remove it from the stove let it cool down for a second or two and then dip them like that but then you also can color them and if you want a color you're running niche or white base in order to get the color that you're going for or you can just dip it is like I said before but my mixes almost a 300 and as soon as it comes off the stove I'll be back ok now that my mix I'll cut off the stove I went on hit it and it my flavor in my extract but me and the instruments just like a banana yellow and I know y'all might be saying if I'm usable you know why I'm not doing yellow cuz I don't want to but I'm using a metallic color by Chef master it's a blue anything really pretty moon I'm just going to everything and with this I don't need you know white because I did them for my apples awhile I'll call a few weeks back and you really don't need white you don't need a lot as you can see see that blue color listen metallic calling me she's they're all completely okay and I'll be right back when I position is fun okay now we're gonna take a strawberry remember you already got yours get still pull it up and twist tie it so you don't have to worry about that and now we're going to take something we're going to dip it just as you would on a candy apple I'm gonna shake the excess flip it sit it okay I'm gonna do one more you can see take it shake it twirl it and flip it okay dip it take it shake it twirl it make sure you get all of it almost set it down and place it okay in y'all these do not hold up for long periods of time I mean if you looking to make these and you say you want to you know keep them up for like five six hours you know it's not gonna happen not even if you place them in a refrigerator the longest they have held up for me was for about an hour and a half other than that they start breaking down and it's just the way it is I don't know why I guess because I mean they're strawberries and you know they are already you know salt and they starts to break down thank God I got that paper though huh and you're gonna place it okay one more just yeah got it on mice twist tie thank God I can just cut it because I'm not gonna touch it into the cool down you know be careful cuz this candy is hot I don't know if I thought my hand was made of steel or what but that's it that's one you place it okay i'ma show you how to look as soon as I get all this out the way so I'll be back okay this is the finished product remember see I got this big bottle on the bottom in strawberries this is the same technique it's apples you don't want this you wanna dip as usual you want to shake Toro and hold upside down for few seconds so let it hor it and then you want to place it down then you have a bottle like this I like this but this is the same technique as candy apples nothing different about it we just use the strawberries instead of apples so if you liked the tutorial give it a like so come up don't forget to rate subscribe to my channel and any questions you may have you can leave it in the comment section below and I'll be sure to answer them and so my next tutorial hope everyone have a blessed and wonderful day you", "2QMXLRUbvkU": "[Music] welcome back to free Mike here we are making watermelon infused it well cannabis infused watermelon candies today hard candies so let's do this so I got everything ready here is one and a half cups of infused light corn syrup how you doing today Russell what are you guys smoking on anything good hey guys doing some watermelon infused candy today because I don't know how it happened but I got a phone call this morning saying that we are completely out of edibles at the dispensary which is crazy we should not be out of it this is a third different cup of infused butter so I use infused whipped butter and infused corn syrup and we infused this with a pretty even dose of indica and sativa this is three 1/2 cups of sugar plain water it has a little little watermelon flavoring in it hey guys I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of stir this up so we can look in the pot so I have infused corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming back to my channel my name is Karen a and you are my bluff I am you need to eat edible for the first time

be enjoyed this video no I don't know how right at this moment right now I don't know how it turned out I don't know when I'm editing it and crazy party dress party just like I was checking out comments comment coming up Concord comment gonna make comments comment ok CC b9 Clare [Music] [Music]", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what my sister's doing because it looks so fun oh so good were the beers oh goodness she's looking at her little feet my bestie mary came and of course she brings your girl drink so this is what i'm drinking and she is drinking and OG mother law because she's just straight oh gee and my mom got wet mom Wow a white cloth so she has the white claw and then yeah we kept it more than lonely here so we are on our way out because girls like these shouldn't be kept at home yeah yeah okay so we're gonna go out and drink our beers mom we're gonna go out and drink our beers somewhere else because that's how we do things here but I hope that you guys liked the video you guys comment and subscribe please don't make me beg you guys but yeah the edible wasn't a big hit you guys like I said before in the last clip chance to say bye you guys Nuala by my okay yeah so bye see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "bVkrUctmqT8": "hey guys it's bright again and today we are going to be making candied strawberry okay so I'm just gonna

thinking it over there so you see that next we are going to add 1/4 cup of what the bun bun [Music] hey guys we need this to be coming to a boil you need a wet paper towel make sure you're a white thing of it so that all the sugar we needed to comfortable eight boil I don't have any food coloring okay I got this bowl it mix it up a little bit what okay guys and now we're going to be dipping with a bare hand so please be careful because as you can see it's still bubbling I want to show you one shower and how I dip it I'm just gonna don't dance for likely oh this is be careful this is really hot and get it all around and then I'll show you how a couple might look good okay guys I'm going to attempt to hold I really hope y'all could see this all right we got to get that hot water ace up but let me just show you these show very late and the finished product I will show you all right guys", "hdHmBzhT-MI": "Greetings my beautiful lovelies! Hello, it's Emmy, welcome back, today I'm going to be making Tanghulu. And Tanghulu comes from China and it is a dessert that you can find from street vendors, and it's typically made with ha or Hawthorn fruit that look like little red crab apples that are skewered and Dipped into a sugar syrup that hardens and sets and it looks like resin, it's clear It's gorgeous. And then when you eat it, it has this great big crunchy crackle of sugary sweetness, and it sounds fantastic So Hawthorne fruit or ha is not really common here in the US, actually I've never seen it before, but I've seen alternate versions with fresh Strawberries, and now we're really coming in to fresh strawberry season here. My sons and I just went and picked them the other day so I have a basket of beautiful strawberries and I'm going to make a version using these So the first thing I'm going to do is get my sugar syrup going, it does take a while for the sugar to get to the right temperature (pans clatter) and get myself saucepan and a thermometer. Now, I have a spotty relationship when it comes to making Sugar syrups, if you want to see me fail a few times, you can check out the Dragon's beard video Put the links there, so we're going to be 1 cup of granulated sugar, 1/2 cup To that, we're gonna add 2/3 of a cup of water (Emmy makes a neeurp noise) so what we're going to do here is bring this up to a boil and evaporate a lot of the water I'm going to bring this all the way up to the hardball stage about 260 265 degrees and then we'll kill the heat and then coat our fruit. So it's important that your thermometer remains submerged So I'm going to double this recipe and I'm adding two cups of sugar and one and 1/3 cups of water So while my syrup is boiling I'm going to prepare the fruit So I'm gonna set this off to the siiiide Humanah Humanah I mean really Ya'll are beautiful. I'm just gonna take off  the little stem here So in Japan when you buy strawberries they come in little flats just little boxes and they're arranged like this with the little butts Pointing upwards. They're just so cute and irresistible. Next, we're going to skewer the strawberries. I've got a variety of sizes here My pot is pretty small. So I think I'm gonna opt to go for shorter skewers I think traditionally they use long skewers and they display them that way on the carts But they're also using large pans of syrup where they can just drip it on top of the fruit So, but I'll try both and see what happens This is after just a coffee stirrer and I used scissors to make a little point on there And I like the idea of using a flat because then the strawberry won't rotate as I I'm pouring syrup on there Cute So this size skewer I can have five I Think I'm just gonna stick with these tube sizes. Cause I like that Although I'm tempted to make the big one too, and we're almost there. We're at the hardball stage. We're at 263 Degrees, so the next step is to take our strawberries and we're going to pour the syrup on top and then set them aside on A tray that has been covered with some parchment paper. I'm going to step on the steps will cuz I'm a little vertically challenged. Okay. use a spoon and just Ladle the syrup all over the fruit Cover the strawberries completely What is it about a clear finish that is just so Sexy I don't know. It's like all those resin tutorials It's just because it's clear, you know. Alright, let's try a longer one So cool Quickly onto a tray Okay, why is it getting not clear? Not into that. I'm not sure what's happening here. But my syrup is now not clear. I Think maybe there's some water that got into here and so it's starting to seize. Look it's turning and turning into like taffy That's not cute Alright sugar syrup experts what's happening here? So I'm heating it up Maybe I should have left it cool and not increased the heat. This is totally seized Wow There's another sugar fail for you Okay lovelies I think I have yet again Failed when it comes to making the proper temperatures for syrup now while my first attempts look quite beautiful glistening gorgeous covered in a Resinous almost plastic shell they're not as hard as they should be although I do have to say it's about 100 percent humidity right now because we have got thundershowers going on outside Maybe that has something to do with it I suspect it has to do with the temperature of the syrup and then my subsequent attempts and depth looking like this my sugar completely Seized and it's not beautiful and clear. Although it is much harder. So I suspect what happened is that a little bit of moisture got into my syrup and then it act as Catalyst and started this kind of crystal formation that happened but sugar experts do chime in with your expertise Alright, let's go ahead and taste these itadakimasu! See, that's not supposed to happen. this is definitely more like a taffy it's sticking to every crevice in my mouth and it's supposed to have an Shatteringly glassy like texture. Now there are tons of ASMR videos of people just eating tanghulu let's try this one, which I think will have a better texture here we go. Mm-hmm. As far as taste goes they're absolutely delicious You've got a juicy juicy strawberry in the middle That's a little bit warm from the hot syrup. Then you've got it covered in sugar. I mean, it's fantastic. Ohh, look it doesn't even come off the dish All right, as you might expect I'm not giving up on this sugar and strawberry nonsense I'm back to do this again with a different recipe and a slightly different setup as you can see hair's in pigtails So that means it is very humid outside But I've closed all the windows. I've got the AC on so That might help I am also back with a new recipe Thank you guys so much for chiming in on social media to tell me that SAS-ASMR has a recipe that works. So That's what I'm doing today This recipe includes a little bit of corn syrup and I have to cook this up to a higher temperature Which I think is the major fault of my last experiment that I cooked to 265 degrees which is the hardball stage and I should have cooked it to a hard crack stage I was following the recipe directions, but they didn't work for me into a lovely pot. We've got here 2 cups of sugar doink 1/3 of a cup of corn syrup That's new and in her video, she uses a dry measuring cup for liquid ingredients So I'm just gonna do exactly what she did because I want this to work What is it with me and like hot sugar? It just doesn't work like Dragon's beard anyone? Not perturbs, not perturbs. Happy. Okay, according up of water Which is significantly less than the other recipe Okay. All right. I'll crank this up Let's get her going And we'll stick the thermometer in there and that will be our indicator of doneness Do do do do do. Another thing I learned in her video Was that she skewered just a few strawberries rather than having the beautiful long stick of them Which the vendors have in China which makes sense because they've got vats of this syrup And so they have a lot of surface area to drizzle the strawberries But since I'm working with a relatively small amount of syrup it makes sense to just have a couple berries on the stick and then dip the berries into the syrup rather than Using a spoon to drizzle it less chance of contamination last time when I did this my syrup started to seize as in it turned into Crystals, and it was definitely not a syrup anymore. I'm hoping to avoid that too by doing that kind of dip in twirl technique Let us see don't we love failure, failure is great. Actually, we should fail more often. I keep telling myself because this is how learn Certainly. I have learned a lot about candy syrups, and I've learned that you must get it to the correct temperature Now if you don't get it to the correct temperature, then it's not gonna do what you want to do, right? Right. I refer you to the Dragon's beard video because that is full of you know, candy syrup Follies, but it's good It really is good And I'm trying to be aware of that as a mother as well to let my children fail and that is the best teacher Surely so there's the syrup. It is pretty cold that 120 degrees almost and it's just Starting to bubble and we're just gonna let this go for about 15 minutes Holy Smokies, it's already at 220 okay, so I think the corn syrup must accelerate something here because when I make Fondant for my bees, which is the winter candy that my oh I keep bees By the way, if you guys don't know that I refer you to my bee blogs I make fondant for them in the winter time and it has corn syrup in it And I noticed that it comes up to temperature a lot Faster when I use corn syrup. Huuuuuuh Food scientists do let me know what's going on here is if the corn syrup is ready established to a certain Something something that it gets it to go to like to holy smokes 32 to 40 like last time when I did this I was trying to get it to the hardball stage and it took me forever And this is already at almost 240 degrees. Okay SAS-ASMR  I'm already liking your recipe. This is beautiful Don't know if it will be successful yet but it's a good sign that was super fast that was about seven minutes It's already at hard crack. Okay, now I have to work really quickly this time I'm gonna take the strawberries and just dip them into the syrup like that Allow it to drip. Okay, that's looking gorgeous Set on my tray yes dip drip Yesss! These are looking fab now they just got to get crunchy, okay That's actually a lot easier than spooning it too. last one oh Yes So far it is looking beautiful I'm so excited and that happened so fast in seven minutes when I had this on medium high It came to temperature *sighs* SAS you're a genius Thank you guys so much for suggesting her recipe look at the So out of failure comes success and it makes the success all the sweeter, yes! I'm so excited about this. These are perfect and beautiful and they're crunchy as I can tell already They're gorgeously clear. I didn't have any seizing the temperature came up very very quickly. In less then half the time that SAS said so Beautiful look look at that It's like they've been dipped in resin. Alright, here we go. itadakimasu! Delicious Delightful so much better than my first batch the first batch was chewy and The strawberry was juicy and delicious as well because these are fresh and ripe strawberries But the textural sensation that goes on here is so much fun the strawberry is slightly warm because the syrup is so hot and just so juicy, and then you've got the sugar coating on the outside that is just glass shatteringly crisp so that contrast between textures is so surprising and delightful and then of course, you've got the delicious flavor of strawberry and then just sugar I mean So much fun. What a great dessert. All right, I'm gonna eat this last one before. All right Really really great Super fun. Alrighty I hope you guys enjoyed that one. I hope you guys learn something here on my beautiful tanghulu I'm so excited about this This is actually very easy when you have the right recipe and the right technique If you make these, please share your results with me on social media I want to see your lovely sugar coated strawberries and yeah, share this video with your friends. It really helps me out Follow me on social media so you can see my follies and foibles Sub if you're not subbed already and I shall see you in my next one Toodaloo, take care. Byeeeee!", "H5Fis95bAV4": "it's not hardening [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel I've been pointing at home I've been going to at home and I've been so bored so I resulted to watching food videos and watching all those food videos made me really miss the food in China so since I can't me the real stuff I thought I could just make some tongue Hulu I had it in China it was pretty good they usually make it out of I think strawberries and Hawthorne berry oh it's like I'll insert a picture here they usually only have it in the wintertime because I guess it gets really hot in the summer and then the sugar would just oh I don't know but this is the first time I had it and it's pretty good so I'm gonna try and remake it okay so I watched a couple YouTube videos on how to make it and I feel like most people fail on their first and second attempt but I don't know what makes it so hard because all you have to do is wash the strawberries dry them skewer them and then dip them in sugar it's just like four steps but I don't know I guess the sugar part is what makes it hard okay so we're just gonna wash this probably just pull it off and then put the skewer in it so now I think we need to dry them I guess it's like the same concept with like chocolate-covered strawberries if it's not completely dry then the day won't stick but I don't know like I'll try it needs to be yeah that's pretty good it's fine I'm just gonna dry these and then yeah we'll see okay so I tried these and now we're gonna skew them I got these skewers from a kebab thing from Moscow I never skewered the kebab and I just kept these but I guess now they're coming in handy I think I can only do one per per stick yeah I'll just do stick usually there's like I think six per stick and it's just like usually it's just like a long stick of like six strawberries but my sticks are too short okay I just need to make sure that it doesn't like wiggle yes so did one fall into sugar I don't have a candy thermometer I can't eat thermometer that says you gotta measure the temperature of the K of the sugar okay so the recipe that I saw they didn't use any corn syrup which yes that's not good for you anyways right so yeah I think the ratio that they used was sugar water two to one yeah so I'm just gonna do two cups of sugar - 1 cup of water that's a bottom secret it's not even one for the rest of Ag into the cup and see how much there is love should I just do one cup of sugar - half cup water yeah oh yeah that's a lot of sugar okay yeah just do that Wow didn't even cover all the sugar I think it says you're not supposed to stir it you're not supposed to sorry just let it burn you don't want it to hurt they said that if you stir it it crystallizes well should you like even it out first say something it's not okay and then they said to like I think it was a medium heat okay feeling really confident about this so first wait like eight minutes so it's 111 right now and then test to see if it's ready dip like a stick into the sugar and then let it sit in cold water for a couple minutes like I mean yeah when you pull it back out if it's hard that it's ready if it's so gooey then you let it keep going for cold more minutes nice see you guys in eight minutes she watch the video game it wasn't very clear they just said leave it for eight minutes and it's been six six minutes already yeah but like this is happening really fast I've also oiled a baking tray with aluminum foil so that once this is dipped I'm just gonna set it on there because we don't have styrofoam it's just statistics it's not very authentic but I was prepared for this okay so I have a cup of ice water I'm gonna dip this in here the sugars like falling off the stick you guys ready which I just do it and we just did you get any are you supposed to turn it off first yeah okay I'm just gonna go for it that seems like a bad idea but you want to pour it's not like grabbing a lot of sugar maybe it'll look I don't know it looks pretty good he's got to let it dry you think so harden yeah you know if this doesn't work we can just make like this like a smoothie Adam strawberry hey guys check out okay but like I don't know why this water thing didn't work oh wait you guys I'm looking for the one I'm looking for the sugar I think it just melted into the water the ice quad yeah so like this is probably sweet no just water we actually this made this really misses here see it's like disappearing oh is it because like oh what do you realize you know that might be why I might not have boiled it you said eight minutes subjective to a while they said that if you have the sugar of dip it in the water if it's hard it's done if it's still gooey you need to boil it longer and obviously mine was still gooey how's it going it's not hardening wait let me you just boil the rest when I boil it again and then I'm gonna redo pit because the sugars not hardening okay solid plan cuz it's not like it's overdone it's underdone people do this they do not like bicycles too like they literally just right around their bicycles selling sticks of tongue Lulu maybe they may give up hope I feel freaking blow sugar in my own house and they're boiling sugar on the back of a bicycle oh it's getting harder okay yeah now all the sugars like holding its shape but it's still gooey it's turning brown I don't think you wanted wrong no I to do starting to smell funny in here it's not sticking I see it holing up like what the like how much time I have from when it's ready to when it's like overdone but you should be good now I was like another four minutes eight minutes so I don't think it's ready yet it's six tears not funny it's not hard though oh yeah so gooey I don't know what took this long you definitely undercooked the other ones oh it's stuck you see like the sugar on here so like that's the first time it's ever like stayed on the stick Wow but it's still not like hard like it's very malleable oh you know and it's supposed to be hard oh wait you know what the eight minutes might have been like the sugar had to be boiling oh yeah that's just in the pot for a minute yeah yeah it made sense the heart or is it still pretty soft it's still a little soft dang we're getting there ah much different than the other one oh my god well out of tune oh yeah I think it's ready okay let's redo this this is a log go air then the last time promising do you see that drip okay they've been sitting for like two minutes really pretty hard but oh they're all hard should I try one I do it was okay that one came off pretty easily look it smells like nothing wow it looks pretty good try okay so maybe tell you I'm going to leave it out put hey you should probably leave it out for long funny just let it dry a little more it looks good we just need to let it harden should I put it in the fridge yeah cuz like they make it outside in the winter oh that's true and you're leaving it next to a stove yes the strawberry is pretty good though that's good I was happy dude that was tragic okay so I put the strawberries in the fridge for a couple minutes I don't think it's like it any harder than it was like it sounds hard but like you know yeah it was like soft on the inside like it was just chewy like it wasn't hard sugars chili sugar well okay ready okay cheers Cheers not a good time what hit it's worked oh it's pretty good sure there's pretty chewy it was very hard to I feel like I got a like two pieces of Laffy Taffy in my mouth yeah thank you all it's pretty good though yeah it's just I think we needed to cook the sugar for longer yeah when that made it uh-huh but lesson learned oh my god I think we need to put in the freezer for a little bit okay so I want more because it's good to hold on to for like two days did you have an entire no I don't think so so like when you eat it it's supposed to like straight up crunch off mm-hmm yeah I know what you mean we should have done like two at a time [Music] yeah okay we're gonna put this back in the fridge and then come back into it okay so it's done ten minutes I don't work what I pressed it and it's very gooey right yeah no so wasted all these I'm so hard yeah boy it's trippy that's just wrong here we go I'm still very chewy mm-hmm a little bit harder like it's getting crunchy mm-hmm I don't think the fridge is gonna do anything else no mm-hmm do you not want to do it again cuz I know we can do it we don't have any yeah part was good I'm sure yeah I'm just throwing this figure out I feel like we like went bail boy didn't succeed I feel like we got to see so like a 75 it's really good it just involves a lot of teeth picking mm-hmm I think which I miss again when we get more strawberries and when we get more sugar do this is pretty good but definitely follow up definitely follow the like dip the stick in sugar and then dip it in the cold water trick because I feel like that's a very good indication of whether or not your sugar is ready we kind of knew this sugar was ready we just did it in new ways which is we always stupid but it's okay but yeah thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next week bye guys", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of dispenser here in illinois and we're actually going to be approaching people to let them try delta 8 thc so they can see what they think about it

candy aisle hey guys Jeff here with her review of well I don't really have to describe it I guess these are just the strawberry hard candies right um I actually think that technically I'm not I'm sorry I was trying to figure this out I'm not 100% sure because I bought these at a bulk store but I think that these are the our core our core brand strawberry candies but there are a couple different companies that make this kind of candy I think that this will probably be familiar to most of you out there this is a hard candy strawberry flavored this kind of wrapper design has been imitated by a number of different companies I know I like I said I think this is our core is the company which I reviewed a couple of their products before in the past and they're like a parent company stay on like a lot of different brands but they're all a little like somewhat obscure brands but I think this is the our core one I think the other major one that you'll see a lot is the Brax one but the Brax one they take take care to at least now they put Brax across their strawberry candies but like this is like that standard like long-standing strawberry candy that you would have seen for years and years and years I know I always saw this at every waiting room I ever what went to as a kid I remember when I was whenever I was like where was I at the hair salon the hairdresser and I would be like waiting to get my hair cut as a kid and they would have a candy bowl there and I would always go for these ones oh they're so good and I know I mentioned these when I did my review of the para Gina linking candies because those along with these these are really the ones that were always like the special find they were kind of all over the place at any candy bowl in any like office that you had to be waiting at these were all we always seemed to be around but but they were fantastic they're just they just I always have such good memories of these kind of candies so let's let's let's have a look here you open one up and okay here you go is the rapper so obviously it looks like a strawberry which is great and it's a strawberry candy and it's a hard candy so I think these are technically the pair dark or strawberry filled bonbon candy I don't know what they're called they had some like dumb name but sorry not dumb I'm sure it's totally appropriate but you know there's strawberry hard candies the thing about these hard candies when the strawberry ones in particular is that and this is kind of the design that everyone goes with with the strawberry candy is that in the inside of this hard candy it's got either a cream or a jelly sort of a filling like like a juice filling almost right so it has that extra burst of flavor what was I just reviewing recently that had that now I can't remember some sort of uh wasn't it was some sort of a toffee a taffy candy what the heck was that oh my god guys I'm sorry I review so many candies here I'm getting them all confused anyway it doesn't really matter this one is the strawberry candy and obviously it's pretty straightforward just looks like a hard candy let's give it a shot and so right off the bat strawberry flavor he's pretty good but you're just like it's like equivalent of like a mild strawberry lollipop say kind of interesting that there were these strawberry candies and yet strawberry lollipops I don't feel like they were ever a huge thing lollipops far more often cherry flavor right okay I'm gonna get into this mm-hmm hmmm so much like the para genome as I was describing that one hard on the outside but it's about some apply to it especially as you start biting through it you really can make some headway and it's almost like a like a real softer interior and it's got all that flavor in the middle hmm now it does had extra flavor I didn't taste any actual like cream Center in this one so maybe this one is not the same as the right so when I was thinking of maybe this isn't the arc or one cuz I'm pretty sure the arc or one has a cream in it so this could just be some random you know off-brand one however it has the same like substantively it's it's more or less equivalent when you get to that softer Center it still has more flavor to it so it must have had a little juice in there or something I just I just noted that I didn't taste any like an actual like cream in the center which I know some of them really have like a like a real distinct different kind of a liquid in there right but this this must've had something in him because the flavor was is pretty strong once you get into the middle and I always loved that about these strawberry candies in the there they're so they're just so so flavorful once you get get into them I'm gonna open I'm gonna have another one see if I can hmm no not seeing any specific cream in the middle this one or jam or extra juice but it is softer and it does have the flavor so we'll just call these strawberry hard candies I still think they're great um I'm gonna go out and try and find some of those other ones though maybe I'll try the Brax cuz that's like you know sort of a top to your brand right mm-hmm but this is really good if you like hard candies these strawberry hard candies are a great one to get well I just wonder if it's maybe hard to navigate the market of them because maybe you want some specific one cuz this is clearly not the one that I remember exactly from my youth but it's almost someone that I remember from my youth you know what I mean so if you're looking for something mm-hmm I don't know this is it but for me it really brings back the memories even though it's not exactly the flavor is still all there and I gotta say it's really good anyway walking mikania I was gonna rape the strawberry hard candies I'm gonna read I'm a 4 out of 5 it's good stuff and I'm still gonna go on to search for the ones with the actual cream Center or or a little bit more juice in the middle but but that's what I think of these you guys let me know if you have memories of these or any other specific kind of hard candies down below in the comments and thanks very much for watching

workout my muscles aren't fatigue I feel good I feel like replenish I don't feel tired these companies are the [ __ ] to say the least also they come in 250 milligram and 500 milligram the 500 milligram bottle comes with 20 gummies and this comes with 10 you're still gonna get the same dosage per gummy it's 25 milligrams per gummy which is a really that's a decent amount of CBD you're gonna

bunch of other cool [ __ ] on there too so check it [Music]", "rNpe7V-zpUM": "[Music] hi guys so today by a super super popular demand i'm going to show you how to make candy strawberry if you guys are new to my channel i have my main channel at sas asmr um i made these it's super super easy all you will need is corn syrup sugar and water i've i've made it once without this and it was a total fail so if i were you i would go out and get one of these it's super it's worth it you'll use it again for sure um okay so let's get started i've already cut up my strawberry and my um golden berries is what i use they're so delicious they're actually super sour so it goes really well with the um the sugar and it kind of balance it out a little bit too so so we'll just get that ready and set it aside because once your syrup is ready you have to work super quick otherwise the the sugar will the temperature will drop too much and then it won't and then it'll go all hard and weird after okay so in the pot two one fourth cup of water water and then one third cup of corn syrup obviously you don't have to use this brand this is the this is the brand that i happen to have on hand because i use it for um my korean recipes then you can kind of give it a stir i'll show you what it looks like give it a stir a little bit now you can at this point add your food color in um because if you add it at the end because of the heat temperature difference it will splatter i mean you can but it's just not suggested so i kind of i stirred it before i put it on the heat so this is what it looks like before i turn the heat on and then now all you have to do is just turn the heat on for i think let me time it for those of you who don't have a candy thermometer like so let's let's see how let's see how long it takes for it to get up to 150 degrees timer is going let's um get our skewers ready our strawberry and our golden berries these are so delicious and so so so so so easy to make so i have my wooden skewer sticks now on in in my video i actually have some with the with um the strawberries not cut up like this just so there's some variety i think i'll do two these these are what i have left from making it last time i love these by itself anyway it's like sour and a little bit sweet i love them oh and when you coat them you can either put it on a foam like stick it on a foam so it will dry or you can just get parchment paper lay it flat once you coat it you just set it and then it will it won't stick that's what i'm doing today let's go check on our syrup it's been so far four minutes it's like the easiest thing you'll ever make um oh and i forgot to tell you guys it gets super super hot the sugar syrup so you you really really have to be careful um i would not suggest making these with kids because they would want to touch it and it can get pretty um pretty uh dangerous you guys so five minutes so far um got our parchment paper ready our strawberry golden berry ready just waiting on the syrup let's go let's go let's go i'm just waiting so it's been almost 13 minutes and our temperature let me show you what it's at right now it's at exactly 150. see that 150 and this is what it should look like kind of sticky bubbly so i have to work somewhat quickly turn this off so you just turn the heat off take this and that's what it looks like all you do is basically drip it coat it let it drip let it drip see it's like getting hard already so [Music] if you guys want to see the full video of me eating all this well not this set in particular but you can go and check out my main channel on sas asmr but for now i think i will have one of these huh um well give these a try and let me know how they work out and i will see you guys in the next one bye", "0DR3s3E1VwM": "first pass of the day first batch this morning what is tiny bit more look at that you'll be a professional one day you gotta just think in this turn you know yeah they're just having had the bigger bag I don't know why but you take sugar sugar right [Music] fewer forgotten ahead that no don't think so it's just a habit so i'ma start today I've never really looked it up to see exactly the properties of it to what it really knows what my father and my uncle's always said it was just to stop cracking it's for the hood if this for the sort of cheese a fan on the go outside Karen which I get other people yeah most smell outside like you when you said you were a kid becoming on getting off the bus right yeah I'd smell the candy and you knew what we were doing hey I can smell on the park console packs the old days was following the publication small not yeah [Music] [Music] regular [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every lemonade was going to be the first batch but I I messed up with it like that because I didn't do that all right with them we're supposed to be 24 Compaq for you - 21 are you it's just because you most of the time to do 21 pounds yeah I'm just not to have it I put it together and that was that yeah yeah I realized later worse things have happened to it oh yeah like what crack mean one so for this condom good part that's the other day you guys burned that didn't happen so we're gonna just pour half yep that's good you'll have to scrape the kettle yellow they might want to get the last chick a mini letter then we're gonna add strawberry in the kettle some actually go ahead and do the lemon oh no I've got one 3/4 I believe you you crunched the numbers I wrote down what was she putting they're pretty stronger remember we just did this driver this one oh wait you did write it down yeah you said to take point here two and three quarters it's one of the worst it's I got it written down I'm telling you three quarters it's two or three quarters for lemonade one three quarters for card remember we were just talking about how strawberry gets three shots here double batch and lemonade gets the five shots yep that makes sense next doesn't think this he'll be very awkward but he does I'm just his heels they were dug in okay okay I guess worst-case scenario just isn't growing strawberry well do you put too much strawberry and it takes chemically don't want that this good I just want to make sure it was like a compass it's so cool over there if you like it does smell a little bit chemically but also like Captain Crunch and over here there's no men women hands huh well just look lemon oh my god yeah this smokes just like oh yeah it calls just like hold yeah well it was calling off a little bit you want to stay in there bring it back to the basement we have to pour this bench Craig yeah so you need me recycling me out right here okay let's not burn that to you it's so annoyed so I was thinking some crazy candy related thoughts I mean some off-the-hook stuff I'm almost afraid to say it but I miss it because I forget it but don't forget it I'll remind me know the savour would know nothing not to see every line of every candy I was thinking of what if we put something crunchy and like what if we got crushed up Oreos and added into peanut butter peanut butter full mandatory all just murdered us for reals yeah and peanut butter and then maybe a free chocolate cover yes yeah so I have an idea that I am pretty certain would work be and I know that because one of our viewers actually did it and sent us pictures and it came out really great they did caramel filled ribbon candy well we totally want to do that don't try that our example yeah they didn't yeah well we had apple pie so should we do that which go for our plans the summary only it's a public experiment but SMERSH Mona seems to change this all up yeah it's over I'd still like to try that out because I'm gonna be me but yeah that would be pretty cool but then I had another one we're talking about I came here what flavor ribbon candy we were talking about the other day Cara was there she's saying well what could we fill that flavor with cuz you don't feel things with they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it marshmallow fluff chocolate I was thinking what if we took actual cream max actually cream some crushed Oreos in the back into cream request Orioles in the cream and then we put that in urban candy justic Crisco and confectioner sugar make our own Oriole fill and fill it with that we could make like oh my god because we could take the the chocolate liqueur uh-huh like a chocolate flavored ribbon candy and then really ribbon we did anyways yeah and then just fill it with Oreo filling oh okay if you put it in just cream I think that they would get like Siamese huh I really like well I was also thinking wouldn't it be interesting if we crushed Oreo into creamy feta green Oreo cream green I'm talking to treatment we make for our starters I know crazy but I think yeah I'm saying just take some cream you've you know and you'll drop it don't don't starts facets that in the middle of ribbon candy and then you can have a flavor whether it be Oreo or whatever that you're like fruit flavored oils we could do anything if we did if we put out your ice cream oh we have people are want maple maple pecan and there's my crunches I just asked for fresh pecan and oh wait crushed up Oreos to cover the whole thing okay yes Oh ain't you glad well if you wanna you can make him 24 cuz the watermelon all the watermelon we need maybe should make it 24 we I mean we need so much watermelon orange you glad this is probably so wait you something take it down put in the hook yeah oh yeah you see that's way too soft it's just sticking to the table so let's talk about strawberry lemon-aid so I don't know if you picked up all that wasn't we flavored lemonade this one we played strawberry I was dropping here no we figured instead it's like pouring both in there we thought we'd keep himself at the trial that's how that worked out and we we might get some point inside football flavors in one pedal and see how that works so today is May 30 and this strawberry lemonade is going into our fruit and friendly bash but by the time you guys see this video I'm friendly badger probably sold out yeah and the strawberry lemonade assuming it tastes good cuz this is an experiment we're just trying it out but hey let me taste great Oh strawberry tastes great alone why would the taste great together me so that time you see this video we'll probably be doing separate flavors women in is a separate flavor to buy as a standalone flavor yeah because we we just tried that out with watermelon and put that video up one yesterday can't start out with 120 bags of it it's gone and that's where we're making more today kind of on the fly we're gonna make another 48 pockets today but there's just so much to candy makers can do out yeah they're giant they're trying valiantly but it's kind of like trying to push a boulder a really big one up a hill and sometimes it rolls back with crushes this is what Mitch fossil wants to make up strawberry-banana hmm right I think we should do a bunch of bananas in a bag blueberry banana mmm banana Irish cream Oh banana anise banana peanut butter banana peanut butter would be killer good the Elvis heart candy you certainly feel tired just watch me yes I mean do you wish you were me I'm not tired I just thought the water table should be much more bringing it over warm seems like a good idea until you realize that like you can't trap the air in felt school that just means that you're no longer just doing this for fun just do more work for longer yep yeah your mom kicked in my side you see I like its second form the strands in it and stuff like that's usually like you know when it's super cold it's not it's very pretty quick get that nice silvery look though that'll be cool yeah if you pull it can you call it too much like was it was like I'm a lot of it way more because it kind of stopped oh no it'll it'll keep trying Baltimore white yeah yeah we've never thrown into like it like right now on rough you just saw but like it just got a lot paler yeah kind of go on for that like silvery can I make it a hammer please hammered telling the cameras that's a beautiful collar hey how did you do this it actually feels fluffy hey I think you pulled it you really did this is puffy feeling are you calling me yelling Oh yellow yellow belly how'd you make all right we talked about like the Old Yeller esque movies like what was up with that what you're like let's make kids really sad Shiloh Old Yeller what's the other one Bambi there's that one between two ferns do you remember occur between red fern where the red friends grow that's what I never saw it though wait what the book yes I've never seen that car hmm yeah classic motif boy s dog boy doesn't have dogs yeah the brave doesn't have dog in sad way talks to the hound lady in the all right think so I think there has any okay let's don't bring that up yeah I'm sorry come on I'm gonna cry right into the strawberry I was just gonna say is this a good pink or should I keep lighting it up I need your strawberry you're awesome he knows you can do a strawberry but don't do a raspberry I can't wait to taste this I wonder if it's okay if everybody before lunch I gotta call my mom I want you to trust him right now no I said I call my mom okay I guess I guess that going now hmm how close did you come I guess AR purple or I mean this one this color here this light right here there's a little bit larger there you go do it do it you well yeah this one's really soft a college dealer plates I can tell this is 24 pounds I didn't realize he was gonna be together the old days we've done this before but we put him back to the back what flavors we gotta do that way to do two flavors in one yeah [Music] I guess Lord or twenty pound batches pete'll it would it would save us a whole 45 minutes of cook time you know what is it your arm zone would you be able to pull it oh you'd pull it in two different two halves you know they'd be two separate flavors I mean one flavour ran into the next warm funny this way we used to do it to save time especially if you're doing half batches you don't want to cook up like 10 pounds of time does Oh I forgot to bring moving or [Applause] yeah I saw that because they're talking about you have a second favorite SNL star you know first or second favorite you have the ranking in your head I mean Will Ferrell's probably but I really like John Belushi is Santa present shiny all right so what do we have to do for the water bug and we're going to throw the green is that what we did last night yeah yeah everybody knows watermelons are pink in black and brown looks like a whale you is that belong [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wow that's good just come back one more piece of candy laughs you know [Music] I'm telling you this batch and the last won't like by the end of it I can feel it I make your flooring it's mostly like in my shoulder looks like you two right guys what can't you break eye contact let me say that I was just met with you [Applause] nobody I'm telling you ever gotten a good okay ID in a while extra dump will conquer the world okay well I think it's just because it's cold it's it's softer than old Hawaii just watch stuff we do it man [Applause] probably just device and Ida scrutineers lie no me Craig [Applause] all right so like after this point it's just gonna be strawberry we control that yeah we keep that separate no no no I mean it touched the lemonade and got kind of a fix right here voila sent my line kids [Music] if you right now oh they let it get cold then once it's called [Music] these pants that's well okay but a month this week's yeah Fellman right nari all right oh hey I gotta say three chilling down the hatch but alright charity putting her mouth Dadar traveling off camera I got strawberry immediately I got lemonade immediately yeah so no hands aside I had it done yeah I got Captain Crunch and free loops immediately look at the crunch berries yeah I'm getting crack one open there's a cereal yeah baby I will say this I like it's good it is good just try it with some milk in a bowl mm-hmm eating basically so let me name you take over the strawberry bud doesn't like a real heavy I like how you can twirl in your mouth and it's like all different plated like sweet yeah we can't call it sweet though I do they're not taken lightly really good don't folks how many thumbs are gonna give this man we always give it to Oh and putting comes up my toes get your pinkies okay just the correct right legs up we can put Karen's and reward comes in here all that technology doesn't exist yet because the thought watermelons crush your old box something good yeah and I know life will be changed you know really dank but not by the part like where you choke on it yeah you're gonna have to meditate over that damn I don't know what that's all you have to try anymore just gonna have to make pieces you can become okay Terry okay panting adjourn it is meeting adjourned is [Music]", "vm6lR4ZFaZM": "been unsuccessful you know I'm talking to hey I got two viewers already one like this went on and went away I guess I'm not like hello hello this is Greg had lofty pursuits where we make hard candy Jessica is making a batch and I'm videotaping it so we're gonna see here we've already poured the hot sugar we're making strawberry so please remember that and tell everyone else who logs on and that's what we're making and we got the taffy machine going somebody just said this is the best thing to wake up to in the morning what yeah it's a stretching machine we can do it on the hook with the larger batches like this it easier to do on the machine and the number of poles you have to do depends on how long you can pull it and I'm afraid that one garden Jessica I keep on suggesting when we get a rack and she keeps on talking about me part contacting OSHA the ribs here watching us make candy my folks you can wave [Music] so we pulled the yellow background for the strawberry no it's hard candy w.b.t East X guys you gotta have nicer handles than this or I can't read them online so is this coming across okay did you hear me okay we make great part candy we're actually going to do a video on grape hard candy sometime soon and reintroduce it you just heard somebody listening to me on a video on a livestream on a video it's extremely meta so here we go jessica is now making a yellow triangle a bunch of them actually this will be leapfrog for the top of a strawberry I bet you guys didn't know it was called the Frog at the top now did it I made that up no it's called the sprout I'm just we still do nectar candy there are patterns in the candy of there will be there isn't yet so this green is going to be the green top to the strawberry [Music] hello Bianca welcome here from Australia we have some people here from Melbourne Melbourne Florida how long will I be streaming I suspect until either my battery runs out or I run out of Meg's of our gigs of upload bandwidth I've been told that since I have t-mobile t-mobile will give me binge watching for uploads - because it doesn't know the difference so we're actually testing this today if I have any bandulus levant when I'm done with this for the rest of the month I'll be a little surprised but I'll be happy it is strawberry-flavored yes just like that strawberry emoticon lick your screen check it out I've seen Willy Wonka guy in London I don't care what you say the London is not as hot and sticky as Tallahassee just because you don't have air-conditioning hi Debra we're in Brooklyn are you from if you could teleport not only could you be here but I tell you what I needed you to pick up on the way this is interesting when you have 370 s Watchers right now so that over there is the fron at the top of the strawberry this over here is the background color jessica is probably making the center of the strawberry berries or seeds would you want to put a hairnet on that hair it would be destroying fine art it's a hard question whether there's a cooling time difference between fold and unfold candy when you pull the candy you bring in air so it's colder to begin with no matter what you do Wyatt the Gryffindor why don't we sell unicorn droppings online because this is our current stock of unicorn droppings they sell out locally faster than we do these shelves are bare because too many of you came to visit and bought our unicorn droppings we don't make a lot of them and they sell too fast they're also annoying to ship they don't fit in the boxes our website is www.miamikettlebell.com they're named correctly so just because now I'm making each little seed of the strawberry individually and she's using candy multiplication and here's somebody who just bought a unicorn dropping and a thinks of generic silly putty that's really cool silly putty can be sawed off your play it at home kit I know it's dangerous but we perform without a net I hope your ancestor who is executed in the Salem witch trials as he just posted was executed after he had children not before we're making strawberry image candy right now Jessica is building the strawberry we've done plenty of live streams I just don't tend to put them up for public view after this live stream is over welcome to lofty pursuits where we make hard candy if you're not aware you can go to WWE and get our candy if you order the

[Music] sometimes you want the candy sticky so while she's working on the outter app she's throwing it on our batch roller to keep it moving this machine's cast-iron weighs about 500 pounds judging from having to have lifted this with about six other people and with me it's somewhere between 1895 and 1910 oh it will twist it it just doesn't matter at this point so this is going to be the outer wrap Patrick of course we make government candy check out our website WWE do I just got back from my trip today from visiting Hercules candies and I haven't had a chance to even look at the footage hopefully I'll get enough to put it down PD stands for public displays a confection of course we do International shipping I have not done a live stream for Towell day here goes Jessica making it work but you might want that you push in that little hole yo hole or you fix it already [Music] I'll give you a tour of the store after this how do we look just because I'm loud and obnoxious doesn't mean that all my employees are some of them are quiet severe in taste and then there's justice so what she's doing now is she's scaling it down you cut off the next piece can you hold it up to the end up to the camera show us what the edge looks like can you see that folks yeah it's a strawberry out-of-focus strawberry but there we go can you see that good she's got to put it down in the some candy it's not gonna work out it's got to be kept moving see we already got a little bunching going on there we go now we got a video of somebody videoing us video candy tastes better when it's meta can you repeat your question about two hours from starting the path to finishing a batch maybe a little bit more the banana video you said the banana candies to die for what about our dice flavor candy we have made candy in the shape of dice within candy that looks like dice we're to die for not bananas that's not that's confusing [Music] probably not gonna make the tide pot candy again that jokes been done I also got a very polite phone call from the head of consumer safety of Procter & Gamble Mike was a very nice guy I'm not making any more right now because he asked me so nicely he didn't even threaten or anything who came to us very simple agreement I was reading a candy that looked like a poison he was making a poison that looked like a candy that was really how the conversation what now anyone out here have any questions because you probably mirror the questions of the people online we're streaming right now by the way you can take up to 18 months to get fully mastered maybe a little bit more Jessica's been here since October and she's just about got letters going and she's possibly my fastest student ever so you know it really takes a good few months before you can even solo so

three so now we're having a problem here Larry our candy taster isn't with us anymore we had this problem four days ago and it's very sad we miss Larry and we can't do anything with our candy if we can only have a solution to not having a candy taster what we have a volunteer oh let's give that gentleman a piece of candy you know we usually get everybody raising their hands but since everyone didn't we all make do with oh that's a whole lot better we miss Larry it's always better when it's warm did you run out before she got to you don't worry they'll be more we got enough for one or two more pieces so if you want some of this candy for yourself you can go to www.dvc.edu/financialaid on Facebook Twitter and Instagram yeah over near Tallahassee were right off i-10 you can visit us in person and of course if you order strawberry right now you'll probably get something from this very batch that's justit is making db2 we are starting to make it with no artificial colors we made a batch a couple of batches for Christmas of white candy canes and we're about to do a bunch of our flavored candies in white and sepia tones all food coloring three because the brown we use is nothing

you who are watching all I have to do is say alexa order 15 pounds of Cheez Whiz cane sugar folks beet sugar is almost not available in in the North America of course we ship to Canada is Rose flavor yes we make Rose candy that's rose flavors which means it's either going to be one of the most delicious things you ever tasted or it's going to taste like your grandmother's soap it all depends on how you were raised and weirdly uh we could go tomorrow I was at Hercules candy the cane sugar thing is fully shot it's a real pain to edit apparently the Alexa thing worked I've always wondered it would the necessities look like pretzels for toppings and egg creams and possibly the bag looked like it got watch McCall at cartridges for the whipped cream container we shift to Northern Ireland you may be right it's that hair attached to you like permanently oh okay I was just wondering do you have any food you can get Jessica's hair candy it almost exactly matches the colors she uses in the forbidden fruit and yes I do own lofty pursuits and public displays of affection back to the future yeah you're right I shouldn't ask hello Anakin how you doing stay away from the darker side I know you've never heard that before of course we met custom candy Anna yeah the act shape candy is still available I [Music] learned so much at Hercules candy those guys are great ok folks it's time to take it bye bye Jessica", "BhBnkbvzuCI": "[Music] so [Music] 308 it is 308 extra trees what's the temper of the table we got uh between 100 and 110 what's on the other side the other side of the table 104 one same it's like 100 between 100 and 110 okay do you know what it was last time cold it was like 98 oh yeah and it cooled off really fast yeah so this time should be better yeah it's trying to be a little bit better we've got everything i guess hey sure i am watch your head oh screw this on the other side and the ball's not over there oh that's not important i'll do my best [Applause] that's good watch they're going to be perfectly even i'm going to feel kind of done with the air i'm just kidding i feel dumb it smells super banana right put a whole hand of bananas in here it already smells very behind me whoa gloves are going to smell bananas [Music] that's it you already put it all in i should have wished i missed it how many shots you have to put into that 1.75 and then max putting in seven and a half seven and a half yeah i guess that's why it's not as strong over here wonder why i totally smell strawberry yeah no i feel like it's not as strong as a banana which i feel like is extra strong well you know one of the one of the flavorings is twice as strong as the other one yeah i still smell strawberry though it's pretty well you guys haven't tried it yet have you joe did you try basically i had a piece yeah yeah how was it it's good nice juxtaposition flavors well balanced as all things should be we should take a temperature reading between the two and the kettles yeah i mean you gotta assume that the other one on the main stove is cooler but i mean warmer yeah i don't know for sure yeah oh that's cool yeah i'm pretty sure this one's colder yeah yeah i mean it'd be nice to have that on all this so is the the bottom of that double boiler not quite as warm as the stove then well it's that and um we lift this off and move it and that's still sitting on the cut the cast iron ring over there which holds a lot of heat yeah and uh the conductivity of copper is really really it's the most conductive metal so it cools off the fastest so when we take it off that and move it to there it's going to cool off quite a bit yeah by at least like one or two degrees i mean i don't want to get too difficult according to my calculations it's like 3.7 oh exactly every time oh wow no wonder we're having so many cooling problems do you believe me yes very believable oh what calculation stinking spoons that'll do you perfect [Music] do you guys think it is uh evenly split or uh not really probably no one's sure if they just just took more time to fill out and that's actually going to get there this if you look at that i think the table is not quite level because this end is usually thicker it's actually so i guess you guys could invest in like a scale to put underneath to make sure it's always well that's not that important also i guess you would also have to know how much the other one weighs because it's not always going to be the exact same yeah we could like fill this up dump out like exactly half of how much we put in and then mark the kettle but even that and the kettles are different weights too you have to take that into account it's a whole thing is it a whole thing or a whole kitten caboodle i like being alone it's fine just uh come out when you need a hug we'll find terry for you we know how much she loves giving hugs the people who don't know my mom that well because they don't know in real life i've seen my mom reject hugs from family members yep can you count them all oh no like i i've seen i've seen people ask my mom for a hug and my mind goes no [Music] she doesn't really dance around it just goes no yeah we mcdonald's we got pretty good at saying no [Music] um your kingdom look looks good yeah are all your loyal subjects doing your dirty work well i could still uh just bring this off but you're just bringing off stuff that looks clear so you can't really what to see much of anything oh you might be able to see it you see that one line disappear yeah cooled off a little bit but it's way better than it was before yeah yeah last time it was just i could see how cold it was even even me the guy who doesn't make any candy and his eyes are closed all the time yeah that sounds cold the last one actually did sound really cold though yeah you like you picked it up and you put it down the table is like yeah that one's coming together a little bit watch max open up i guess they can i almost said openers but he doesn't really want to use it i got to tell you okay have you ever did you ever play with legos when you were a kid never never ever not even your house with you yeah so so you wouldn't understand no do you know like it's like the gray piece and like you click it on it's got the two pieces you click it onto a piece and then you can bend it to get them up yes i never even used that thing like i i can't listen are they really yeah that's just not right lego i'm disappointed in you yeah remember those giant legos the what do they go clothes lego yeah oh sure he just loves building with him right next to the train set you know i guess wood it's kind of like legos for adults wood yeah yeah just make whatever you want although legos are also legos for adults dude i'm telling you every year for christmas i'm like well i hope there's a lot guys yeah logos are awesome yeah that was like my thing when i was growing up and uh i was subscribed to lego magazine same here yeah did you get the bionicles uh comic uh yeah i got a couple of them yeah yeah and i was trying to i think i remember telling my sisters and my parents that my animals because i was like they wouldn't it wouldn't say bionicle on here if it wasn't a word oh boy show me show me in the dictionary define bionicle these robot things it's a nickel that's made out of bios wow okay so just a heads up joe this this next batch the corn syrup is pretty soft so what's up the corn syrup oh yeah i don't know if that'll have an effect does temperature have much to do with that or that's humidity i think yeah but we've had some batches that are like wicked wicked soft and other batches that are you know you get the water really cold yeah yeah nice and icy and um i don't know if you guys do but i like to shake the excess water off too because sometimes you get more water on your hands or yeah for real yeah when it's sticky i put more water on my hands if um if you have too much water you form a layer in here and then that'll like eat away at the the invert yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yep all right so in one of the last videos that we posted somebody commented wait so putting water in your hands makes the corn syrup not stick to you but then you put water on the candy to make it stick to the candy yeah and they said how does that work i said magic we can put uh the kettle over there that we do for the banana and the lemonade that we usually do you can put water in that pour the candy before it's hardened into there and it won't stick to the copper kettle right this is madness joe it is madness water how does it work absolutely nothing who needs one again water's overrated it's about electrolytes it's what plants crave it's great all right i'll be back you guessing my age yeah i could never remember i know that you're always a few months younger than me and i'm 48.48 what am i younger than my dad yeah hey dad you got five bucks yes we'll give it to you later yeah this seems a little bit warmer than the last this is a little warmer than last time i was going to start with my caramel here oh i'm calling for a new carpal stirrer more sugar in candy this is the broccoli sugar so don't oh my god did you as soon as it touched it was like yep let's go find a scoop wow got even lighter hey steve hey how you doing buddy good you need a hammer yeah i got a little piece stuck on here how could i tell i because of the way it is oh that looks nice [Music] do you know why we hit the hook with the hammer why the vibration loosens it from the hook oh cool wow isn't that amazing i learned that from from the old country the science guy he will not be denied you've been in that room too long buddy humans i remember talking is it coming off no it's still stuck there come on steve work your hammer man i thought you were worthy okay little joe's getting tired dad yeah it's still warm it's a good color i'm thinking tired i got this i could do this all day long and that side [Music] there it goes i think you got it all right good you know one more one more [Music] oh i got a little bit huh so close [Music] that's not too much so are they about the same temperature oh no this one's a little warmer remember when we were pouring these out yeah and i said uh let's dump a little more i shouldn't have said that no they're about same size oh yeah if you kind of squint at it and turn the lights down they're like the exact same size yeah turn the lights off yes close your head you better turn a little less just believe what you want [Music] to switch for this one sure what do you mean you want to pull this one this up extra banana just the way we planned it get your hands up all i can hear in my head was get your fingers off of my butterfinger we'll probably put it up on top of this if you need it go back a little bit further i would i wouldn't put a lot of it but the bottoms would so yeah this thing's plastic yeah [Music] what do you think it does seem a little more strawberry right yeah yeah because it's a little bit cute yeah it just like pops a little bit differently yeah because a little see-through it seems almost like strawberry jelly is there anybody in the planet who doesn't like a piece of toast with some butter and jelly on it like strawberry jelly specifically not something that i ever eat but still delicious did this uh hmm that color difference it's not too different or it could just be the first couple pulls cause you know the car will change a tiny bit yeah uh when i make candy we have been going like every other like i'll first i'll throw it on the hook and then i'll oh yeah he didn't do all the hard work yeah yeah i see what you did there i understand i i am almost 30. yeah we had a lot of youngins next that's it he's only 30 since he's 26. right i've been almost 30 for 15 years dude when i was your age i was almost 40. all right so back off yeah i should be a little bit more understanding well when i was 40 i was 50. oh that he's been 40 and he's not even 30 yet yeah yeah you almost have two friends named bill and ted yes i'm going to pretend like i i i get i get it so like i've never seen that movie huh yeah where do you meet him um they're at a different school you have a girlfriend kevin yesterday [Music] so but people have asked us many times before where they get a candy cutter like that and we usually answer it saying if you find out please let us know because we don't know we just basically inherited these i think that they have friends yeah steve says we just talked about this yesterday because we made ken yesterday he said he always keeps an eye out for those things on the market the last time he saw one six years ago oh yeah he hasn't seen anything that's not burning yeah i mean i guess if you're if you're good with metal you could make one i'm sure i mean it's just like hinges and blades i don't know metal stuff but blades yeah i mean if you can fabricate i mean i'm sure that you can figure out most of anything it's not exactly like a modern model no different book dude you tape like six kitchen knives together you can make one of these at home and you can buy those from them like custom with like as many blades as you want different size spacers they've got those things where they mounted them on a like a table with a motor and they just kind of like push this whole giant tray through oh man it's an accident waiting to happen it's all it's like you know it's an industrial candy setting so they've got it all all the safety precautions in place most of them yeah it's it's pretty safe after like the 37 things that got caught up yeah we should put a guard on that imagine like going to work and you just ask your boss like so is that pretty safe like yeah so is that pretty safe oh so your birthday's coming up huh hmm you ever had banana ice cream uh made out of bananas made out of bananas yeah just frozen bananas blended yeah it kind of makes like a big cream okay but i don't know if i'm gonna eat ice cream bread yeah well yeah because if i'm gonna have ice cream i wanna have like cookie dough or oreo or peanut butter and chocolate i'm a stalker for strawberry ice cream i mean yeah like if someone offered to cover i'm not gonna i'm not gonna deny it yeah that's not my favorite choice yeah see i do like ice cream but i'm not much for like cookies and cream and all that well this is coming someone who doesn't like sweets you know what do you know about sweets yeah a little bit i've had ice cream before did this get smaller a little yeah i think it doesn't do that correct i think the heat might have melted it oh okay yeah yep oh can you see what you're doing real quick dad no no this is also a table too huh what's the temperature of the caramel 190. oh wow it's also because obviously that doesn't have to get tempered so it goes through the funnel right so it has to be like pretty hot to go through with them yeah cool stuff have fun brush turtles hey craig i'm not really sure that these are that sharp we just quickly yeah i'll give you a scale of one to ten how sharp i think it is the louder you scream the sharper i guess i'll take this this almost looks like um the first batch almost looks like a cheesecake-ish kind of color yeah see i i think they both kind of look cheesecakey yeah this one's definitely not good yeah it'd be a good color for the strawberry cheesecake though yeah yeah strawberry cheesecake i think would be great flavor like my mama i know was threatening to do cheesecake of all different types of pumpkin cheesecake yeah well i was just saying i think that would be good i figured the pumpkin flavoring was like the pumpkin mix or whatever i think that's why we don't want to do it outside of the season because we can't buy more pumpkin spice right but uh but yeah those were all really good yeah i think you know everybody knows that i'm not the biggest fan of chocolate but cinnamon over chocolate do it good work kids try our best strawberry first i flipped it over and got the banana that's kind of cool that like it's like a sandwich where if you eat it upside down tastes like a different salad i was afraid i was only going to get bananas because i just ate three bananas maybe we should try the fancy connection here well i cleansed my palette first by standing on my head that's yeah i i just read an article about that that gets all the blood out of your tongue totally works well you gotta stand up really fast oh is that how you do it so what do you have to do like a handstand to a flip or like you just get up really fast and then a somersault you've done an arab fast in a plie yep you do that right mm-hmm i'm gonna say this is a good combo yeah i um viewers or subscribers ideas do strawberry banana yeah yeah i had never heard of this flavor combination a few of them asked but max kept whining or whining i couldn't take it anymore well you wouldn't let me throw away the banana flavor i just had to stare at it didn't i get new banana flavor yeah but the old one smells really good too take it home with you okay i'll put it in my car there you go banana bread it's just flavors flavors it works good in the radiator oh does it hey it is glycol based is it's good in the radiator yeah i mean my regular antifreeze tastes pretty good so very sweet right right right blue is sure a little more sweetness i just put gatorade in mine build up a tolerance no one will ever get me but you know every time somebody's trying for very professional taste duster yeah i already gave it 10 vegans yeah wow 10 whole vegans and i think steve's giving it an 11. oh yeah well he was only giving it one thumb up yeah he definitely gives it two okay i like that's eight out of eight vegans yeah so max it was a good call on your part are you happy now yes were you happy before yes okay good so so what we did here didn't really change anything for you all right this is going to go on forever hey guys littlejoe here reminding you to like the videos and subscribe you", "vYtnhK295Kc": "hi students so basically these session or these classes we'll be discussing about the clinical nutrition and medical nutrition management for CHT and heart failure we'll be discussing about the coronary heart disease and heart failure what would be the nutritional intervention or dietary management for the patients who have CHD or heart failure problem not only that we'll be discussing about hypertension myocardial infarction dyslipidemia ischemia and also angina so let's start let's the ball rolling so eating for a whole heart whole delights child do we have to understand a basic nutrition though so that we always try to refer the American Heart Association's read they say try to maintain our healthy weight healthy body weight because we know not only diabetes but also obesity is a risk factor for the car do patients maintain healthy cholesterol level maintain normal blood pressure what we can say normal tension on normotensive maintain normal blood sugar levels that means normal i semuc physical inactivity used and exposure to tobacco products so we shouldn't do physical inactivity we should be physical active and also so this is a heart-healthy food pyramid where we can see the many portions is a very larger size where we can see people can run the you know having lot of vegetables like orange color yellow color white color green color where you can see our vegetables like Indian flag color be physically active enjoy meals with others and also exercises and so the next M Baba above there the greens all the greens like green leafy vegetables other vegetables with a very good content of chlorophyll so is a very good antioxidant very good amount of phytochemicals so these are there above that we have we can see there are lot of fruits different color fruits seasonal fruits whole grains so what are the recommendation fruits and veggies whole-grain high fiber oily fish lean meats fat-free skim low-fat 1% Erie reduce added sugars because is an empty calorie we you know very well that if we take hundred gram of sugar we can grade only hundred grams of carbohydrate which is very empty calorie kind of thing so there is no suger at all and little or no salt solid part we'll be covering later on what is the amount of salt and what if the exact amount of salt we can take for a cardiovascular patient you now we are talking about the fat so if we talk about the fat so definitely we are talking about the visible fat basically so if in case of the visible visible fat part that that is in incorporated is dyed should be reaching unsaturated fatty acid and should not provide more than 20% of the total energy so basically if we talk about the fat so we are talking about the good friend okay so dietary fat is a consistent support for the hypothesis of the buddha quantity and quality of the fat directly associated with the elevation of most blood lipids particularly LDL low density lipoprotein cholesterol it has love now we are coming the sodium restriction sodium restriction in theory specifically we if we highlighted the sodium restriction for the hypertension patients hypertensive patient high blood pressure hypertension patients so now you have to understand that one teaspoon of salt one teaspoon 1 teaspoon mil 5 gram one teaspoon salt basically 2000 mg of sodium 2,000 mg or two gram of sodium 2 gram of sodium so if the 5 gram salt is there then out of Vibram to grab ox or a because we know sodium chlorite is the chemical name of salt table salt so 2 gram of sodium or 2,000 mg of sodium is present now we will talk about the sodium restriction how do you do that studies have shown that sodium restriction along strict sodium restriction 0.5 gram sodium 500 mg apart from the restriction stated above meat milk and eggs are allowed in small portion and vegetables we highest sodium content are avoided in Sevilla sodium restriction that is 0.25 gram sodium 250 mg this level is too restrictive and nutritionally in adequate and realistic to be used practically in these restricted quantities of meat and eggs are used in occasionally I have talked about the heart failure patient in the heart failure patient basically the 1 point 5 gram 1 point 5 gram sodium is recommended for the heart failure patient basically so what is low sodium diet basically there are foods are bread chapati sweet rice maize chewy so this is a food packaging level that is something some things outside from your book also will be this light is very critical that you how to understand the food packaging level because this is a packaging level where the all the neutral fact is written so once someone is shopping from the outside market there has to be checked about this reading food levels where the sodium is mentioned put a shame is mentioned Cola stall is mentioned everything else so packaging of food is very important how do the perfect package so accordingly people can purchase folks from the outside market so this is something is very practical very practical scenario that students can understand you now here is our slide the salty foods less often and the three colors are there green means smiley moderate means less smiley food high in salt is strictly known as an angry kind of sign because people can allowed of this thing for force so he will smiley thy food prepares at home basically in fresh ingredient fruits and vegetables unsalted nuts and seeds beans lentils LPS pasta plain popcorn or pasta it was very challenge I see soca our is it were perfectly all right with us oats fresh fish fresh chicken meat eggs yogurt because we know the very good I'm the probiotics this yogurt and curd like lactobacillus Bifidobacterium present ok and also lemon juice in case of moderate type there salted nuts pastries cakes okay soft tough margin is a very moderate kind of thing but this is not allowed ok and ha - that this is very important students because this is also for your learning your MSE theories practicals and your digital life while counseling the patient that is very important so what is - diet all about the full form of - tide is Dietary Approaches to stop hypertension has been shown to help lower blood pressure and prevent heart disease stroke diabetes and even some forms of cancer it focuses on eating more fresh fruits and vegetable this is a guide to how much of each food group you should eat every day based on eating some certain amount of calories per tape so in case of weight reduction in your ABC book is written as MF n 0 0 5 maintain normal body weight BMI eighteen point five to twenty four point nine so now we are talking about the hyperkalemia okay sometimes there are certain medications they have lot of you know job nutrient interaction if we talk about Arnie okay and it ends in receptor omnipresent inhibitors they're the adversely winces hyper carry if we talk about mineralocorticoids antagonist receptor emerets Vistaprint agonist emerets like spironolactone all the action this kind of thing so in that cases we should although ways studies are low potassium touch okay so here is the chart you can find which are the potassium low potassium in low petition basically zero 200 mg medium potassium 101 2 mm mg and also hyper high potassium that is 2,000 mg and here it will also example low potassium foods high potassium foods for your references you can see as a pictorial presentation you now we are discussing about the fluid so fluid restriction is necessary fluid restriction students try to understand is necessary only if edema is present only his edema is present I already talked and spoke about edema in the previous lecture slides that what is reading all about so if edema is present but in that case is also theory you should understand but practically you always try to follow our cardiologist or a physician's prescription what kind of drugs he or she has written me if diuretics is there during the summer and where you know we are losses our isotonic salt they're invisible perspiration this happens so in that cases the so this is the basically measurements of fluid where I try to weigh the focus in this presentation of any peanut kind of things so you can have a nutshell you can just see also document you yes some people has a question get if what they can do if they go thirsty so being cursed is very common this does not mean that body means the more fluid you have to be more careful use ice chips just rinse your mouth freeze juice and ice cube tray lemon wedge chewing gum definitely sugar-free chewing gum strawberries this is the way they can you know can some kind of lubricant of your mouth for the psychological front so this is something they need to so in cases they're the practical present patient if you see them in words in cardio patients in our during internship this will be a very helpful you captain high-salt drinks should be a perfect you you you now there are certain jobs near a subtle drug there are certain drugs like you know any antique Oberlin job like warfarin comma Dean as it ROM this kind of drug they're always being a dietitian you try to restrict vitamin K rich food not vitamin K resource so in that cases I have been listed high moderate and though in case of high broccoli brussel sprout cabbage can loyal net use parsley swabbing all spinach this is the way high moderate is asparagus cheese margarine olive oil peas red cabbage and Louise alfalfa beans since", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "TGHWwV_CI58": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review of the medicated hard candies I've done reviews on this before I've just never done uh it's root beer so there are 30 milligrams each and I still have this really bad cold like it's it's horrible I don't have the the muscle pains or anything but everything's just kind of here and you just feel like [ __ ] so I'm hoping that this will this will feel better this will feel better this will make me feel better okay so let's let's see I'll do okay all of it why not it's Saturday I have nothing to do I've been like this since Thursday maybe you know oops make me feel better I'll put these two in at first um they taste like the root beer surprisingly because I haven't been able to taste [ __ ] and then you could taste like it tastes a bit of that that we'd taste or whatever it is but I will say the the root beer ones here you can taste the root beer I've done a big fan of root beer but at least least I'm not tasting like the weed because it wasn't usually when I do it really sticks in your mouth so what I'll do is let these dissolve and when I come back I'll let you know how long it took for them to kick in and also what I'm feeling and all kinds of stuff like that so it'll be doctor probably usually takes about an hour yeah it's like around 12:30 now so probably it'll be a little bit it doesn't work if art used to work really quick and notes that's real roughly about an hour you know what sometimes I wake to I've been waiting I'll go a little bit over when I first start feeling it because usually it what I'm done telling you guys it's you know if I would have waited the extra 15 minutes or whatever to do it or even half an hour sometimes cuz it just keeps getting stronger for me anyways and anyways we'll be back I'll be back to tell you what I'm feeling and everything else ok so it's been like um like an hour and a half I would say and at first like I started like when I first started to filling in feeling feeling this it was like roughly about it like an hour in ten minutes and then hang on I'm gonna I'm gonna light a joint so that one's looking around in an hour and ten minutes and then um I was like well like I started to feel better right I was like oh my sickness it's finally going away so I you know I went out and [Music] it's nice but it's like really windy here you know and then I put some like I had like these little um glass pumpkins you know whatever so those are going inside and [ __ ] this [ __ ] joint so then you know then a I had some other things I had to do like ahead of this list Lola this list that um but I you know whenever I thought of something that like had to be it has to be done before the snow comes and then I went back in the house cuz I was in and out doing stuff and it was like so nice and cozy in there but i was like no we can't feel okay like I feel better than I did yesterday way better there's the bus we better than the first day I'd say smoke this when when you're gonna cold still feel like that congestion and [ __ ] but you if you need to get some stuff done let's stand in here in the cubby [Music] somebody's mowing the grass and I don't know why anyways I'm dumb so the medicated hard candies you get them at Canada smell the root beer is actually pretty not like it's it's not that bad like you can taste a lot of the root beer taste some I find that you don't taste like you know I don't know I say strawberry Kiwi I think that was one of them but you taste like a lot of the THC the root beer I tasted the root beer I'll stay stay on stuff but the root beer was I need to just keep puffing on this [Music] thank you Charlie likes this kind of weather I know what I want to give this [Music] I'm gonna give it a 9 in the oh my [ __ ] category just because like this this feels better than when you take like cold pills you know like cool pills gets rid of like say this stuff you know is for a couple hours and but sometimes this kind of cute nut cures but it makes it better than the cold pills not too sure how it would work on the COFF maybe because I reek like if it's a indica and it was a really one of the things and it was feeling relaxed maybe you would kind of slow down your cough ever think anyways that's my gig at night because you know you're sick but it feels so much better like it's the only thing to is okay so this is we're still spoken the new Caen before I got sick I like the munchies like crazy since I've been sick I have like and cuz that's part of the cold they think that you have no one no appetite you can just you eat but it's like it's not a big deal and maybe it's because like you can't taste either I don't did you hear the bang fire a Charlie wait Charlie's right there he didn't even alert me what's wrong with you there's mr. Berg [ __ ] I was okay and now like I'm really maybe they don't like the smell but it's really windy oh maybe not just slam the door what the [ __ ] this review went from like being grade and it's still great but there's just a little paranoia anyways I was gonna say maybe gonna rake the yard but I'm not really sure I want to do that anymore this [ __ ] joint that's not even me that's rolling it's like a little machine so dr. everywhere there's one year that's one over there just keep smoking it and they won't know if maybe I'm having us like it just that cigarette cigarette come on this I'm just a little nervous I was all talkative Oh forgotten I'm coffee I [Music] don't think you all forget it's a little close I don't think you want to watch me rake the yard like that's a little bit boring so I'll just keep talking um yeah this stuff is pretty good I could move or they'd probably be so much better if you weren't second did it but and and you'd probably you know like when you're sick and you don't sleep as well this stuff here would probably you would probably get a good night's sleep yeah I would have thought a like if you [Music] stop charlie you take like cold medicine and whatever for how many years and like you don't even there is stuff that is and it lasts longer too like cold medicine is it doesn't last that long like four hours like maybe two hours this stuff lasts way longer than two hours and you feel way better there yeah there's Charlie he wants to play hey Charlie want to play um okay so um my hands are starting to get a little bit cold and I think maybe I should go inside so um I'll meet you guys back inside in like a minute or two okay so um it's been like it's just about been like two hours and then still I'm feeling uh still pretty good I'm a little bit hungry not like um not like you just you just need to like chew on something like a couple chips or I don't know whatever it is right and bettan you're good like you just um the only thing that I noticed that's different is my nose is really stopped right now but tomorrow I still feel good and get it at can abysmal and I was also just thinking like maybe it's not mad for everybody but I should take this before you know taking the cold medication and you're still like um you feel like when you do when you're high except if you have a cold then you feel the cold part too but it's like you know it's there but like the symptoms aren't really bugging you overclock the the type of day it is today like gum it's I don't know it's ten or eleven or out and sunny and there's like a wind and there's like there's not much there's not like a lot of leave while the trees most of them are pretty bare just the type of day it is it's like a you know it reminds me when I was a kid just like though you know like you can smell Thal it's like one of those days these hard candies you know pretty good and if you want to maybe experience um [Music] now that he said that okay so yesterday there was like a little bit of snowflakes here not like a lot but there was so many like there was not like enough and I remembered when I was a kid that we had a deck and there was me and my brother and my my friend and her brother so I was friends with her and my brother was friends with her brother I don't remember we're outside playing and and we were on the deck and for whatever reason I don't know what worden I remember when it started to snow and it was like around like 4:30 ish so it was it was um like night I think it wasn't a sunny day so it was my not dark but you know it was like kind of like dark anyways remember we started jumping up and down saying they was snowing and like how we were gonna go sliding from this little bit of snow and I was like I forgot all about bad yeah I find like other than like the the the being sick part it's good like I just I wish I wasn't feeling like this so it would feel better but it still feels good um and I think that's everything said nine get them from I can't abismo the medicated hard candies there thirty milligrams each and and oh my god no this is just getting really bad Hey oh yeah there's like a lots of different flavors they have on there I enjoy them [Music] and I think that's that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you

rest of the video and find out how high we get safe today we're starting the videos off with some edibles so we've got it at set times today so we did say was gonna get this done we haven't had much smoke this morning so we're very very shaky very anxious and as I I've had a lot of flashback nightmares were able to class them so you have woke up in the advance yeah I've woke up in a bit of a anxious mood so best thing to do stop day off with the edibles so we need to get the video done so like I said before Frank's to Freddy for these epic literally got different flavors we get through these today and let you guys know how the day goes [Music] speaking I was black [Music] I'm sure reading so what I will say if you're gonna write anything Kong parcels I'm actually right clear often enough for me in abbreviation just so like I can actually see because my [ __ ] eyes the [ __ ] my reading [ __ ] what if it good up reviews okay a scan we come you could definitely taste the resin yeah you can definitely taste the resin in it so that's why I don't know it's a really nice flavor it's like a fruity bitter organic flavor really nice [Music] so we've we're gonna eat the other half I've come because I hate [ __ ] watching myself meat literally and video of myself technically I'm watching myself neat so I hate other people watching me but gonna have to do it for the video but yeah we eat the rest of this off cam and then when it gets to the next time slot that were meant to be having it without the next one so we'll let you know guys save anyway yo save guys we're back and so far so good with the flawless feel like not mega high not like lows of not mega high don't feel like totally totally as high as I could be but it's still a nice medicated feelin is mellow more than anything a floaty mellow just different feel you know that you've had something basically and you feel like the height of it is like floaty mellow Spacey slow hot so it's like a less of intense hitting one etc so in is gotta catch me all the way through the day and slowly get me don't even know what I'm talking about really you can see his game he already goes so basic you're on our second one we're gonna just eat this it's really nice medication this stuff is really good but if you're a beginner I'll devise only eating half you know don't just jump straight in and eat a whole one straight away but they're really nice they're definitely strong ones I don't know what strain he used inside these but it's more of a euphoric sleepy one so it's usually at euphoria sleeping us there's a bit of like creativity but not much because you can't really think about much so yeah this is strong but not strong but this is strong but not too strong for someone that consumes on a daily date on the day-to-day basis but ya don't need the rest of this one and then go on to the other ones for the rest of the day and tell you the rest of the video please guys save yo safe guys we're on to our third one so yeah it's like we're running a little bit behind time but it's near enough for your clock so around the same time but basically we had a little thing to do today so we have to go out and that's why we're running a little bit behind time but this is our third one we let up a little taste see what we reckon mmm won't save it up I was very like creamy but they do taste nice really nice what I find the parboil sweet they are a little bit overpowering but really nice definitely recommend getting these okay finding me so we're going to finish the rest of this off-camera basically and let you guys know as we get on for the day how it's going but so far so good we don't feel too too high bar tolerance is very high at the moment yeah etc etc so is nice like well I say I didn't feel too high at the moment when I went out I nearly walked to the wrong car and I looked at the cars like ah [ __ ] mum were at the wrong car my mum was looking at her back she didn't even notice because it blew a car just for ya our car my mum's like pretty pretty stupid anyway in that aspect like if I'm doing something she'd just follow follow suit and I was like oh it's the wrong car and we was like mum was like what it's like mum is the wrong car come on let's get coffee what's or not this is so it does catch you out it does catch you out so yeah these are pretty strong definitely 200 milligram lollies each one so in the whole day we ran up of thousands I think it is also milligrams so anyways we'll keep you updated and finish the rest of this third lolly safe guys please you're safe guys we're back and we're on my fourth lolly so we're slowly getting through them slowly but shortly so far the buzz it's a really nice mellow one is like it catches you I say mellow for me certain times it could be like quite strong on his peak when you first eat but it is quite mellow it gradually kicks in and gets you and then slowly drifts back off so as nice as a medication my family's actually said to me they can actually get on with me a lot better have a laugh with me it's Snuppy 24/7 and like so they said I'd be being anxious about everything I worrying about if someone's gonna start or something this is actually made me laugh when I'm out and about they said a panicking so much my mom said so you know I mean it proves if I can laugh over going out and having a little joke around with the family instead of being so anxious on snapping at the family it proves that it does how definitely does help the buzz all together I'm definitely giving it I would say it's not the strongest definitely not the strongest so it's not going to get a ten but it's up there with the strong stuff so I guess eight eight on the edibles on the strength 200 milligrams is it's quite strong it's not over like load you know what I mean it's not like 500 milligrams or a thousand milligrams is there thousand a whole packet so but yeah my fourth one and then our last one is up nine o'clock tonight I think it isn't got one left yeah one left nine o'clock tonight so see you then we're gonna eat this safe guys we're on the last one so yeah and if you look at the state of us we are [ __ ] actually we've had a little sleep as well woke up a little little later 15 minutes late done actual last time so on the last one so literally it annihilates you when you get through all of these slowly my family said like nearer to the end of the night basically it was more like lungs II fallen over things literally I just knew I had to have a little sleep literally it is one of them ones it was mad but anyways man anyways guys trust me people never had something that annihilate me all the way through annihilated me already for the day right literally I've got me all the whole day blood Freddie told me to do this it's been a fun day fun unproductive day but worth it so like my eyes are like terrible puffy literally so we're going to eat the last one I stopped I'm honest when is Scott breviary limit but I'm shaking abbreviation that's why it's no point for abbreviation most things just tell me beforehand and I'll try and take a screenshot oh yeah very good it's very nice and definitely definitely definitely gonna get some more of these these were hot me family said there's been nice to actually speak to me instead of but wrong with me constantly so this is good actually countdown the PTSD instead of the PTSD going mad and me having so many flashbacks so then when I'm speaks to my family when family think I'm listening to them but really I'm flushed back in and then I just flipped on just over random things and they say there's no build up so this is actually hot so yeah it does work does work and it's been good to show you guys how the video is we will tomorrow what we're going to do is jump up in the morning and do a whole review about the whole day and how it went so it's going to be like a two day video so anyways we're gonna finish the rest of these and let you know tomorrow how it all went and how we all felt is basically this is just the extra little review overall it was a really good medicine we did not the last video done because we passed out yeah it was really [ __ ] epic it was one of the best highs that I've had through the day instead of not feeling that stoned and medicated I did smoke through the day as well so I'll put that into camp as well so that's probably why I passed out and the knife but for the day it was really funny had some good laughs weren't so anxious and overall it was really a nice height really got you in the body the head it actually affected all of the muscles as well instead of just effect in the brain making you height so it actually got you feeling nice instead of feeling just high with the flavor the flavors didn't come across as the best it was quite sour bitter with the resin but overall it's [ __ ] spot-on with the bus it was spawn flavors could do with a bit more flavor and in each each lot each mix so but yeah overall flavor I would say it's a five on flavor it's still a little bit you could taste that bitter flavor and if you could disguise that a lot bit more everybody bow the apparent 10 out of 10 they look amazing just look like normal sweets smile there's no smell of cannabis in it at all you could just smile like a little sweet berry flavor when you're having the BlackBerry one or different flavors on each one basically the buzz it was I would say like at eight definitely at eight it's not the strongest but it's not the weakest so it medicated me mellow mellow through the day with some funny moments and inerrant to the end of the night because I was smoking quite a bit too near like the end basically I just passed out so it was getting stronger near to the end because of the smoke and I think as well overall I would say it gets it probably gets a seven and a half out of ten of rule in my books so yeah it could do with a few improvement but they are still good so anyway hopefully you enjoyed the rest of the first bit the video and hopefully you enjoy the rest of the week yourself everyone stays safe as I always say there is going to be a strain review coming up Sunday or Monday so make sure you keep an eye on what keep an eye out for that we're going to try to get some more videos basically done through next week as

today we are looking at another product from bang one of my all-time favorites and we are looking at one of their hundred and twenty milligrams we are looking at the medical cannabis toffee chocolate honey toffee with smoked sea salt very excited about this one I've tried a few bang products in the past them and joined them all they all seem quite potent for the for the milligrams as listed I tried the 120 180 in 240 and I've been pleased with each of them so far and again this is another 120 and it is 200 excuse me 120 milligrams of THC the honey toffee with smoked sea salt so let's go ahead and cut into it here take a look give it a whiff alright so there you go so you can see on the front it's got its logo bang bang all that fun stuff some marijuana leaves and then on the back we've got our toffee smells good no wheat smell whatsoever break it off take a bite that is good mmm YUM as a fan of both toppy insulted dark chocolates this is delicious no we taste whatsoever perfect blend of chocolate and salt and that toffee is crunchy and crispy and sweet just on top of that very dark 70% dark chocolate delicious hmm I would just eat this point for sure roughly now friendos as we all know it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel so what the most important part is coming back in two hours and letting you guys know whether or not this 120 milligram and a boil I has got the juice like all the other bang products or not so I will see you guys in two hours to let you know if this is another worthy product from the bang line or if this is

am pretty [ __ ] high right now it tasted great others know we taste whatsoever the chocolate was delicious the toffee topping was crunchy crispy and just delicious oh my god um wonderful um maybe my favorite bang bar yet in terms of taste and I think it only cost me $8 at the dispensary and again for a an edible with only 120 milligrams of THC I mean that is an incredibly incredibly potent 120 milligrams so if you see this at the dispensary and you're a fan of toffee grab it you will not be disappointed it's got the wheat seal of approval alright guys and with that thank you so much for

out on the next video", "-9em9kqHLDY": "yo what up guys mr. reefer here bringing you another video review on another product today I got these magic pebbles you heard it right magic pebbles they're definitely very magical the reason they're magical is because they are infused with 100 milligrams of THC so you know they're definitely magic anyways today I got you guys this video review of the pebbles because I love these these are these just jumped to the top of my list of edibles that's up there with spot suits drink legal drink there's there's a bunch of other books that I haven't made complete videos for but this is I'm glad I'm doing this now because this is definitely one of the top 5 I would say at least for edibles these are amazing I picked these up yesterday on our daily walk with our dog me and my fiance walk our dog to our pot store and because they love her there so she's kind of famous anyways we've been getting these pre-rolls there and I just haven't had a chance to even buy any other type of like even flour or especially in our edibles so I'm glad I picked these up picked them up for 25 bucks so we got ten pieces of ten milligrams equaling a hundred milligrams of THC so each individual serving is Timnath two milligrams and I gotta say these work fast like stupid fast like it took us it takes us half an hour to walk to and from the pot store so hat we ate one outside you know we're not supposed to obviously but we ate one each outside while we were walking here before we start walking here from the pot store tip to our home and it took us I want to say like 25 to 30 minutes to get home and by the time we were home we were just [ __ ] the lid like we were ready to just have a good time and we ended up actually going to the pool afterwards our apartments which was actually pretty nice because I took another another one of these magic pebbles and while I was at the pool and we were just gone just terribly gone we're just there this I couldn't believe how fast and how hard these actually hit me don't get me wrong they're not gonna knock you on your ass it's not strong like that but it was strong to where I felt it immediately after like 30 minutes which for me is good because I mean for anybody is good why would you want to wait any longer for your high right but I feel like with me it'll both usually take up to like an hour something like that from what I noticed forty minutes to like an hour but never as fast as these and these were amazing they taste these I got these blue raspberry ones that actually taste like the little lollipops you get from you know your your doctor or your barber or whatever you know just have like a bow out of out there and the front by the desk and you just like take one at the bank you know those little lollipops little dum-dums it tastes just like that this blue raspberry but I have I'll show this right quick so if you wanna if you feel like you're reading through all through all this you can just pause it actually have I will read part of this they actually describe how they do the cannabis extraction for the edibles on here I says the cannabis extract is uh I can't even talk right now I'm so high about to eat another one by the way but anyways it says right here it's extracted using BHO i winterize with ethanol and then it's distilled leaving no residual solvents so they say they grow with passion and extract with position so it's just a magical experience and it really is I really do enjoy these and these taste so amazing and they look I mean they just looked like candy you know I had to open one because it is trouble with the wrapper I do have trouble with the wrapper I do have to use two hands and since I am recording this I need one hand so I just had to pre open it man these are these are amazing they and let me just show them the light here of the Sun my baby like and you can see the blue where these don't taste don't have an overwhelming taste of THC it tastes just it there's like small hints or whatever but it's not actual it isn't it doesn't over overwhelm and that's what that's what I really like about this and edible because I love weed but I do not love though we taste and it and most of the most like there's some dry like brownies out there that just tastes like straight up ass I'm not for that these are so much better so I would definitely recommend getting these blue raspberry good flavor just go ahead and start eating that but yeah my review are you afraid oh sorry I'm just trying to the flavor I can't describe it's just like a small hint of like marijuana but the rest is just blueberry just straight-up and they're pretty good so yeah I love these definitely gonna be picking up some more 2010 425 it's not a bad deal yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video because I'm about to enjoy this candy Almighty really another one I check these guys out man magic kitchen they were in the Southeast Washington area I Northwest Washington area I don't know I said southeast give these guys to try magic kitchen they got pebbles I think they carry there's different types of flavors for sure they got like pineapple strawberry stuff like that but I think they also have line for there's a different it's not just candy they have other stuff so I definitely give them a check check out see what's up with them but yeah that's it for this video man I'm gonna go roller joint finish this edible and then get high some more alright guys see you guys later stay lifted lift it is for", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated it's a little oily I'm actually getting a lot of oil on me and honestly I since I only paid ten dollars for this I am gonna eat the whole thing and get back to you guys in an hour Bon Appetit and let's get into it hey guys I'm back it's been an hour and I'm here to do a review of the cushy punch gummy this is the 100 milligram okay so yeah not even an hour in and it hit me man I am [ __ ] stoned definitely something that's worth $10 at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "d0ab5GPZD7M": "yeah keep going up cardstock you guys got a business card now you guys know that yeah how do you guys have a digital one good summer lesson yeah who's the bandit it looks like the outline of mom although I can't see her that well because she's hidden she's an outlaw yeah her choose one in 17 states what would you do mom yeah I can't tell you it had something to do with tie-dye but I can't tell you what it was Oh counterfeit tonight yeah oh you did such a good guest couldn't tell me and that I got it pretty quick in one somebody Facebook messaged me that there's a video where max adds the flavor it was cherry the champion cherry & epified video and flavouring form performs a perfect part well no it's a little lopsided but if it wasn't perfect I posted perfect but it was a heart issue so should me where it was like to get screenshot I don't know I'll put that on the facebook at some point yeah they're a regular old Walter White well that's not so good [Music] a sketch like that's a good grandparent flavor like that I don't have a bowl of water spout their house my grandparents kept their butter whether Scotch they kept that out of tune is locked up but it's hard as a brick part of butter right just trust me on that yeah I feel like there's people in this world that love cranberry sauce cakes cranberry sauce love coconut I hit coconut like a fan on the sleep or don't like a family sake and then there's your heart butter people versus yourself but who like start over very soon in the comments who is on team hard butter and enlighten us Oh your mom likes it too no no I'm just saying she probably was if you never talked about it yeah okay so our family is very into talking about our feelings dad you do watch her head I was very quiet for but we didn't put any hot water in the table for this correct oh yeah I felt the table this field decides with a little bit warmer than the other side but I guess it's because that's where the I just didn't know if you did it for Hardy I mean I know we do for tie-dyed for a couple just not I'll put it on the table so you just put it in leave it in there for a couple of batches that stays warm yeah it doesn't hurt enough money too quickly the other lie because this is a butterscotch so I'm not gonna add any citric acid sour butterscotch there's a flavor that nobody wants and you guys are still trying to get the citric acid amount still messing around with that we're gonna add more today because if it lemony should be kind of safflower then once we nail that I wouldn't be opposed to it you're trying a strawberry lemon-aid mmm I'm just gonna have teeny tiny bit which is gonna be tough for me to add a teeny tiny bit next does drop mmm next those drops was trying to say he said it so easy I thought it was a sick thicker you know what I thought it was - I haven't worked with a brown a heck of a lot oh I know I saying I wouldn't be opposed to I thought maybe strawberry lemon-aid you just did that would be okay I'm talking to somebody maybe talking to me just like everything to go okay that's right that was the point I think we're talking about how we would do that but we would do half a batch would have to do strawberry half of you lemonade insurance they're trying to blend them together and just because one might cover the others or mix using other where's that the Kings are side by side that might work I'll come back to that I just want to make sure people didn't miss the corns are being put in because this is so exciting isn't it yeah Wow one more problem good to pick tomorrow to work that way right hand where our sketch is an extra flavor yeah those where we get the food and friendly right and it's not further that off route but it is friendly as opposed to being punched in the face or something wait clove is a popular one we had a Christmas time there's quite a few people that want us to separate clothes really yeah I know it's hard never we make spiced candy other than maybe like cinnamon and anise and the clove wow yeah or even like the cinnamon I I don't much care for it but if some people doesn't love it you know quite what we were actually make cinnamon candy cane yeah cuz I like brown cinnamon and cinnamon stick things but the Senate oil doesn't do a lot for me tell me this I have to make an emergency run to the nature time I'm almost out of organic oat bran hope that piano my guy about as good as quinoa and kale broccoli on a line of filled healthy ribbon cables bag yeah someone said that I can't take over the business because I would want to make all the candy healthy at all no I especially when it comes to candy Candy's not supposed to be healthy it's just supposed to be a tree really yeah just for breakfast not breakfast just some meals three all of your snacks I only like one serving an hour yes and not when you're sleeping perfectly you're right because you can't really enjoy the whole reflects that - yeah yes not maybe okay so we recommend if you don't eat candy while you're sleeping and as a public service enough don't smoke in bed why everybody uses ruse or you candy while you're running this is your interactions how many ARMs do these people have how many mouths okay one of those special hats you know you know that holds your beer straw and your scissor that I can do yeah we're talking about those kids but smoking is bad don't do it adverse there's just no reason for it do eat organic oat bran whenever you can with the chocolate chaser where's a lots of taking I know though we're getting there I heard somebody email me she had a question that one question was but anyways she's a teacher a special needs children and she said they're gonna do tie-dye at the end of the year because they want to pepper tied I like Miss Terry hmm oh they watch our videos in fact one of them says this is relaxing I think I could do this for a job and she said that that was huge so you know they can't be making itself like no I thought that was kind of sweet those go ahead patents we shared it with uh yeah you know right now it's not that relaxing I'm staying awake with no problem but it can be relaxing when you're with a nice warm kettle of chocolate and you just turn it around the table sitting right for it to temporary head it's 9 o'clock at night you're not enough then that's relaxing I basically describe me dad no he's gone by 9:00 I don't really

when the last time was used they've got fifties or something I don't ever remember seeing that when I was a kid they never used that was just put away and you're a kid back in like the 1880s 70 1876

into the shed I knew it was there I come I guess they've got a get kiddin cut it didn't make a good impression out of you know I just held on to everything because I was hoping to have this happen this is what I was hopefully for some days he said peace of mind so once is equipment huh didn't you sell one piece of equipment well I got rid of a couple it was like a year before we started to really wear it knows that I was in that beauty I'd like to tell what he ever had you know it was called the friend machine it was about this high on the table Table nine had a crank on he put cream in it and would push out the cream in us a shake like play-doh remember play-doh when you're a kid you push it in and then the shapes come out as the on that concept for making creams to face and I ended up throwing it away this man well you kept all the other pieces like there's a lot said yeah I kept as much as we could yeah she said behind her own me Jesus yeah she doesn't help us he do you guys

thick no all right I'll keep going yeah come on are you ready yes very ready okay all right let's see if I was lying can you tell the difference between my hand with the gloves hit let me see your

cotton coffee yeah that's it I dear you gonna do this one okay it goes nothing all right I don't know if I you know yeah isn't one so how are you not a Big Mac guy like a medium-sized max no it's my turn to turn the stove on you lost you Oh all right then I get to do this two in a row maybe next day oh you know as I said Oh your shoes thank you - what you're throwing mine no no those are just so like all in its power but all it's starchy and I can choose and there's fall apart the bottoms come with it yeah look at that they're all [Music] high school I had some old listen fella and so I'd like every stroke one greater self this I'm part of the European stick for a while and I just had more grippy shoes I would probably not had that injury all right it sounds crazy but like the best grip shoes that I've ever had were like super cheap Skechers boots like for real I wore them like in a kitchen during wintertime yeah and they were the best I could walk out mop floors like no worries I think the best answered one by hand before they were to choose for us they're like these croc type shoes but I really like no slim pretty great they're actually really comfortable he's very ugly like clogs when I worked at Panera they told us again no slips ooh yeah yeah it's like it goes with like some thought you taking too long pull it out don't get enough of it quick long strokes and you can get out of there soon well that is what we're even for I [Applause] [Music] just like watching you sweat Steve me I've never sweat in my life as we see now they do the longer your own that's neat tell me is that that's beautiful rope that's how you tell my beautiful this here's a smoky tree over teacher you know when you get things between your teeth Christmas trees no hero [Music] so max correct we're just talking about off-camera oh you're right yeah [Music] my opinion I think so as well yeah you guys are both saying it and last time we were all like do you guys agree that like when you think lemons you're thinking like your face puckers up but no it's super tangy and I don't know if it's just me but like sometimes it doesn't even have to be something sour but like when I eat something after a while it just like really gets me in the jaw muscles yeah yeah like yeah I mean lemony target right yeah definitely it's like lemon juice and sugar yeah so yes I fit every time the girl will just have to bump it up although I think we should pump it up we put we put 50% more in this one yeah I mean say we put in too much one bag you could even just call it like very sour lemonade that because people been asking for sour candies I think we could do like quite half a pub next time yeah but this time when they brought a quarter cup I won't have to okay yeah if I can convert teaspoons into cups that would probably help the 3 TSP 4 tablespoons and 4 tablespoons 2 1/4 cup the beach 2014 is going to convert yeah it is it's just kind of like the imperial system or whatever the Imperial I think that's all it is right the non metric system okay I guess I would say it's like Imperial it's like quarters you know threes and then borders and then it's it's it looks alright well there's no help being a foot and there's a feet in a yard and there's 5,280 feet a mile like what go on instead of like it's all making sense so far 1000 meters in a kilometer I just gotta think about it I'm super done I don't know if I should say this part on camera but we're just talking about there's no plans for us or anything but just like throwing the idea around of having like super sour candy if super spicy candy in and I may be calling it like that twelve trials of Hercules or really something it's like so sour it's like oh I don't know if I can finish yeah yeah I got a mystical challenge to finish it like warheads for foundry challenge when we were kids you know like yeah we got to tell you just talking about this and make my teeth definitely sour apple would be good yeah you said a challenge man I could be like joked chocolate yeah I'll give it give it some aegyo huh or you could just buy chocolate liqueur I think it's just someone every time that we use that stuff I try to get people eat it maybe I'll not eat it it tastes bad I like it yeah I want to get a video of you eating it and a spitting it out gun this is good all right could I stand what happened last time we had it out I tried to get here to eat half a piece and she ordered I ate a whole piece damn except in Islamic summer candy potentially spice it handy to be different types of brittle I can't wait that coconut brittle you guys it's great sometimes experimental season after Easter we got like two more months yeah the day after Easter all right we gotta do something experiment at home the numbering [Music] yeah can't sell it we could try samples I thought about making a hard candy hole a few times yeah we're going for it exactly on the floor very pour it into our baking pan if you just do a small batch [Music] nicely put you know some some muscle and amber yeah that'd be cool because you know I've been thinking about sour candy since I started people at home want to do it you can just do it and use a baking pin and then let it harden and then just take a little hammer to it and break it up I got it you made your own more you know all three guys in there's one more piece left over here uh-huh it's festive no way he's gotta be here with a heat up the candy panel corabeth there we go a lot faster we've been there Oh so they were all done with this and then they turn it on it's like why he they would get done it what - and he said yeah they'd be finished the hours and of course waste to me it's like I want to go home yeah yeah like making this stuff but yeah whenever we go to work felons that's why we do it you know what it's gonna sound weird but I think they taste like chocolate cheez-its what mm-hmm it does sound weird yep I just they have like a weird out like bacon cheddar quality to them almost is there any there's no animal products in there that's the 100% cocoa this anime content may contain their so chocolate liqueur presses up okay all right I'll try it on yep I'll see what I'll see it I swear it's like yeah can you be a camera person yeah it's very chocolatey at the end but I think it tastes like it's almost like baked cheddar or something in the beginning I haven't had this isn't bitter wedding 2013 the last time I had just pure luck or and I was like oh if I go to like it a neck roll like chocolate to your shop I'll always try there there hundred percent alright I'm just gonna stop sniffing for now be brave just get it over with Greg go suck on it I like to chew them up but if you chew it up it's gonna taste more like it taste so I assume you mean cheddar right which isn't as bad as I this isn't as bad as I remember maybe it's that one that you guys they're for the more better good the other one was strong okay this one's really not that bad it was like I remember yeah I had before like your hands I could spit I was so bitter this is this is a little milder it's definitely better a little strong I'm not a huge fan of it I kind of minds of like very chocolate baby hot cocoa that hasn't been sweetened ah yeah mm-hmm well that's what it is right yeah yeah so you get chocolate core just add some sugar I like it you know it's not bad I wouldn't seek it out but yeah goodbye let's see go regular chocolate either yeah I'm gonna try making that my in hot chocolate one of these days what's that I think it's just I think it's just that like cocoa liquor and hot water or something they didn't do sugar than the Mayans they just just use the beans and then they they may be diluted it with water possibly I don't know out of it I don't know coming read any Mike Mike Mayan that works lately yeah I'll let you get back to work alright we're hardly working [Music]", "IlAA7xJ3sq4": "hello everyone we are making honey cannabis infused gummies please turn your oven on medium we have regular jello and we have lime jell-o in your pot make sure that you put one cup of water in there and turn on media now we can't really get started okay so the measuring spoons I will explain to you what we're gonna use them for but you need measuring spoons okay I just showed cannabis oil and also cannabis infused honey which is right here okay I'm showing you the measurements that we're gonna need for the cannabis and the cannabis oil I have a cup here full of water in case we need it in case of burn anything it's always good to have one on hand have also a mixer or fork at your side of fun first we're gonna pour in three packs of unflavored gelatin we are gonna whisk and stir this until we get out all the lumps you gotta work pretty fast hour or they won't lump up even more at our temperature of medium height we continue to whisk the three packs of gelatin unflavored gelatin that is try your best with the fork or the whisk to kind of press on it and while you're stirring to get that lump kind of melted in that hot water this is the only longest part of the video guys I'm sorry but we have to get it whizzed up and that's what we have to do and you'll find out once you start doing it yourself okay now we've got a mostly whisk and the water is coming to a roiling boil we're gonna add one pack of lime gelatin I chose line because it tastes the best with the cannabis flavor there are three that are in the best with cannabis flavor and I say lemon lime blue raspberry and green so you have one of those pour one into the pot right now and whisk it all together you know let this come to a boil keep stirring it shouldn't be any lumps now with the flavored gelatin added in it should not be any lumps now that we have let this come up to a boil again let's stir a little bit more into it everything is completely dissolved keep stirring for another probably 20 minutes I was saying then we're going to turn off Dean and let it sit for five minutes after we whisk it one more time this is fun guys and the house smells so good it smells like serious lemon line at this point make sure you have your moles ready and a dropper make sure you also spray your mouth with cooking spray or use a dab of cooking oil I have a gummy one a mini gum you want a bear one I have a star one in a shell 100 mixtures came to the boil this is when we turn it off I'm sorry this is when we turn it off now before you use a dropper this is when you add in the honey and also the oil use two tablespoons of the infused honey and 1/4 teaspoon of the oil stir it and then get your dropper and start putting the mixture into the mugs because the cooler that the mixture is the more jellified and gummy it becomes so we have to move kind of fast so I got the gummi bears right here and I got my seashell mold right here and be careful guys when doing this because this mixture is not only hot but it's sticky and I forgot to mention that I threw in two drops of green food coloring to make it a little darker green you can do that depending on what flavor gelatin that you're gonna use use the same color food coloring I have so much left over guys I had to take it bring out the heart mold as well so yes I got it made all that then we're gonna put it in the freezer for 20 minutes [Music] Twala look at this yum-yum in your tummy Wow Jonesy look delicious I had to cover them with sweet tarts that I had to smash up because we did not have any powdered sugar so if you have sweet tart type candy or something like that that you can crush up and make it into a powder all I did was pour it over the top and shaked it up real good so they won't stick together okay guys that's the finished product and now I'm gonna actually eat one like I said if you don't have powdered sugar on hand if you have any sweet tart type candy candy you can crushed into powder use that all I have with sweet tarts from Valentine's Day I'll have been buying them from the nine cent store because they have big humongous bags also from Walgreens sent me for five percent off Valentine candy that they had and so I just wanna I love sweet tarts so I'm gonna try any heart it is the back of it here is the front hmm nice home in the lime flavor the sweet tart kind of makes a little bit tardy also if you up citric acid use that instead as well and keep them from sticking to each other and it gives them that i'm tartness like a Sour Patch Kid or a sour gummy I'm impressed guys it took me like four tries to get it right but this is my own recipe it's no one else's I just had to figure out like do like science and math like what would what make this work with infused cannabis oil and cannabis infused honey to make it sweeter because in the past my made the gummies the blue ones they was really sweet because of the jello that I picked and it was the blue raspberry but like I said those three flavors lemon-lime blue raspberry and grape or the best to make cannabis gummies because they don't have that nasty aftertaste and also not all flavors work with cannabis so and I've just learned that by doing it three or four different times it's the fourth time so I'm doing I just showed you guys already so I just leave it in the container put the lid on now you keep them nice and sealed in and drying from keep them from drying out and getting hard and disgusting so thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoy this recipe of mine and yeah I'm really happy so now have some animals for pain and now maybe you can have edibles for pain as well okay until next time god bless thank you for watching please hit that like button please hit the subscribe button and also the bell to get more notifications of any videos that I do I am a Lucas warrior I'm living life as Lucas warrior and I'm out", "ZDbyBPkJ_h4": "quick disclaimer if you are under the age of 18 or 21 or whatever it is in your state or you are not legally allowed to consume cannabis I have to ask you to not watch my things hi everyone because she kept me here with either of you I am the illegal medical cannabis patient in the state of Pennsylvania looking to make reviews to help patients like me find medicine that can help them so let's get started today I'll be doing a review of cotton candy hiya Liberty it's also called a tranquility from them I really like the smell and the consistency and everything of this product I thought I was gonna be running with how liquidy it was but it wasn't it was still like butter so I was really interesting to to see the only thing that was a little odd it was the shade of green it had to it I'm assuming that's from too much plant matter getting in I don't know I don't make concentrates that's just my assumption from what I've learned but for me it smells almost like what are they called I think there were honey bites my friend and I were discussing this the other day honey bit honey bit something like that but those little I'll put a picture in here somewhere those little candies so as you can tell they liked it there's not much left this is my fourth attempt at making a review because every time that I have made one for some reason there was something there wrong with the video or it just didn't come out right it's anyway I learned a little bit more about lighting and I'm trying to hone my skills instead of pushing out videos so I'm hoping to have a video out once every other week is my plan so far I might go more often but every other week is is a good assumption for a video for me so back to the review this strain was unfortunately $50 for a half grand which i think is those are not medical prices Pennsylvania that's not medical pricing that's like top shelf rec prices it really helped me out a lot but it's just too expensive in my opinion to continue supporting that price point and I also feel the same way about moxie I think that wall moxie makes very good products they are outrageously priced $80 $90 a gram $100 a gram all those things are ridiculous and Cresco reserves that's also ridiculous but anyway now I will take my job after my complaints about prices I really love my doctor diver switch as well I saw in the comments that someone had asked me to make a video specifically about it so I don't know if that'll be my next video I'm not sure and as I say every time thanks for a birdie heat up speed tastes so good so I'm gonna sit for a second and then I'll talk about it back the string is so relaxing this one is not as immediate say my last strain review by oh Jesus links up there if you want to see it it's very very very relaxing I feel so much so onto the effects I feel like this stream would be really really fantastic if you were feeling down I'm so for depression I for me personally I found it really helped with my Yasha I was feeling really sick that one morning and I took a dab of cotton candy and it really really helped so nausea pain I also feel like it could help with and it does help with for me not as much as some other strean so that's right it's not at the top but maybe insomnia as well I feel a little sleepy but not as bad as other strains of me so for the negatives I just feel like dry mouth and dry eyes the usual culprits are the worst make it is even when I took a larger dose of this I had no anxiety but that gun was me personally so yeah so I don't really know what else to say about this strain so now that my review is done anybody who's still here I have some announcements I will be doing a giveaway on my Instagram so if you want to head over to my Instagram account link I believe is in the description or I can put a thing in the description cuz I never remember to use the description properly sorry everyone Oh Dan deeds what how many days now 24 days or something ridiculous until the Pennsylvania cannabis festival so I hope I thought had a card in here however I hope that I get to see you all there orally so view there be really cool I was also asked to speak so oh and I have like a hundred and twenty something subscribers what thank you that's

video for today's video we're gonna be filming an edible book bang challenge and you guys I'm ready to get high book home are they never did get stuck to you already I'll feed it look at your eyes all [ __ ] stony very well if you guys saw my last video I said that this video was gonna be an ASMR edible look bang challenge but of a segment and it's just so a regular video and then I'll save some edibles for the ASMR because you guys space I got calls bottom freakin edibles I got a total of 13 edible sounds like I'm gonna same sticks for this video and then six for the next video cuz I already drink the lemonade and so freakin bomb you guys but we'll get to that later but anyway so I say six edibles for this video and then I say six edibles for your next video so stay tuned for the next video I got you guys hopefully by next week but we're not gonna give any policies but yeah the video should be up soon all the edibles that we're gonna be trying for today's video is gonna be from the mystery being company if you guys want to go ahead and get yourself some edibles go ahead and check them out down below I will leave their Instagram and you guys can see all the different locations where you can get your own a mystery baking edibles you guys I am so freaking excited to try these already like I was literally sitting at work like oh my god I want to be home already I want to eat my edibles like I want to try them out so bad and there's one in specific that I want to try so freaking bad because if you guys know me like I love spicy Thai see like I know freaking spicy Kenny so when I saw that they had this edible almost like I have to break and try that edible like I have to pre-trip so with that being said let's go ahead and get started with today videos so the first edible that we're gonna go ahead and consume is going to be a fruit punch cannabis beverage and this is an 8 ounce drink in this does have 100 milligrams and I believe it's a hybrid if I'm not mistaken yes it is a high readiness and these are called can bombs so and they also this is a fruit punch flavor they also have a lemonade flavor and a strawberry Kiwi and best believe I got all three [ __ ] flavors i had actually told my homie like to just pick two random flavors for me and he was so pretty nice enough to just give me all three so a shout out to you for giving me all three please so let me just tell you guys about the lemonade for mystery meeting so I had lemonade's before from different companies and every time that I have drink a lemonade it gives me this nasty-ass aftertaste and it gives me a freakin cottonmouth and that's the thing that I [ __ ] hate it's like if I'm drinking something I wanted to quench my thirst like if I have a cottonmouth I obviously want to drink something so that I can take away my cottonmouth and that is why I don't really like to drink an abyss beverages because they have the nastiest aftertaste and then they just give you a nasty ass [ __ ] caught amount so that's one thing that I do not like so when I tried their lemonade you guys it literally tastes like lemonade like just freakin lemonade you cannot taste the weed it did not give me cottonmouth and it does not give me a nasty aftertaste so of that lemonade 5 out of 5 within tastes I gave it a 5 out of 5 once I consumed it I am very lightly so it did hit me I'm gonna say you probably Hemi within like 13 to 20 minutes and it is a hundred milligrams so it didn't gave me super high and that's one thing with edibles that you have to be very careful because they can get you super [ __ ] high so it's only 100 milligrams so I was able to just drink it I was I was walking around Abbey so that's probably why it didn't get super high I was out walking at the beach but I had just a mellow high like it felt so freakin bomb and pretty much tested me a couple of hours and then I got home I ate and I knew not the [ __ ] out I took a bomb messing up on the couch so that was mom the taste of it was bomb the high of it was bomb so I highly recommend that you guys go and get the limit now we're this fruit punch again I have not tried it so let's see how this tastes I don't have it cold and I like to drink my beverage is cold so I do I have a cup of ice with me you guys already know so let's go ahead and pull it up pull it up [Music] [Music] oh my it tastes like [ __ ] cumin I think if you mix this one with the lemonade one oh that would be so [ __ ] fire I need to try that next time fruit punch with lemonade that would be higher so it does taste like like straight-up it tastes like freaking cool database I don't have a nasty aftertaste and so far I have not gotten makan in common so I wish I had more ice so that he could be colder but I forgot to tell you guys so the lemon eat when I had drink it my head as mrs. Jones I can join a trial because just moodily like just take a sip just so that she can try it I wanted to see if they actually tasted like wheat I'm trying to decide which one I want to try the next I have three candies I have one cookie and then it has I believe it's a brownie [Music] I'm going to try these first so these are the cannabis abuse also these are chewy sour cubes it's a hybrid and believe it is also 100 milligrams I believe all of these are each 100 milligrams oh well and it's this potency tested Wow okay nice so all of these are tested for the potency that it has and you can even check the results by the batch each so you can scan it and then you can see the results of the posts potency that it has let's [ __ ] dope so it has a little scanner right here I'm not sure if you guys can see it but it's right here in the corner it's a little scan so you're pretty much scanning and then it says search test results by batch number @w so made that mess repeating info so you can go on there and you can see yours bolts of how much both can see this has each cube has five calories so if you're like me always watching your calories each one of this few tests I color so don't think that's too bad right I'll be right back okay so when I opened it man you can smell a little bit of neat like very very little hand okay but if you just because they didn't feel though but yeah you can smell the we very very things so pretty much very little tubes like this Wow yoky I was little hesitant about these because I'm very very picky with my kindness to a gummy candy just some gummy candy like the texture of it just like grosses me the [ __ ] out but lose your bomb so I ate two now it's sated about Polly like between 15 and 20 these little that red one was [ __ ] bomb I'm trying to figure out if if it has a different flavors of different colors because there's different colors in here you guys okay there's purple blue there's orange there's green and there's all different colors so I'm pretty sure each color is a different flavor well I'm sure it is because I just tried it but no I know hope it's blueberry now once you sit like weed a lot not a lot but more than the other ones that I've destroyed right to the next one so the one that we're about to try next I have been wanting to try this one from the beginning I don't know why I didn't open our face but actually I kind of want to say this but others just open it up bring out so this edible is a spicy watermelon slices you already know me when it comes to spicy and my food is handy this is not Mexican candy but this is a Mexican watermelon texture like this wrong with me it's probably actually I'm gonna check the time because I need to I want to see a column on the edible kids 8:32 so at 9:00 like hella have cake so there's no spicy these have a little kick to them so remember I told you guys earlier that I thought all these edibles where 100 milligrams this room is actually 300 so this one is 300 milligrams dude this one is [ __ ] follow me I don't know when I finish these you're my sister she'll tell you much my age which I have anything that I apologize for the video and quality changing but I have to separate on my phone so that we can continue on with this freaking video so so far we have tried the fruit punch we tried the chewy sour cubes and then we also tried the spicy watermelon slices and all I gotta say is the watermelon slices are [ __ ] bomb you guys are lucky I already kind of feel like it's kind of hitting me and the only reason that I say that is because my eyes are starting to drew and when my eyes grew I start looking like Marley over here with [ __ ] bloodshot red eyes I forget that this is freaking infused with cannabis it just tastes like friggin feel tension it's like you don't even remember so if you were to leave this out and someone tries it like they would get so [ __ ] high but the next one that we are going to try this wants to be the lemon sour I believe all of these are hydrated from anonymous that you know I just saw an indica but so far so the fruit punch is a hybrid the watermelon slices is a hybrid though where the sour cubes are also a hybrid news so this one is also a hybrid this one is there's a lot in here and this is it smells like like a lemon and I like to know that because [Music] but yeah I like to smell these because I don't want to smell that's a lot that is a lot [Music] perfect mix okay a little spicy a little sour there's two left we just eat all of the candies and now we have some treats low-key though I'm getting a little full and again I feel like my eyes are starting to true one day we will be trying so this is a good little cannabis cookie and this is a hundred milligrams of THC this one does not have the calorie intake the other ones do we have forgot to say thus our belts are 10 calories each one these are 10 out well and I believe these were five yeah so these are five calories each one these are ten thank you guys look just so that I can stay like fresh they wrap it up any plastic that's it I've never seen them do that before this is written bombed Giroux it is so mighty like that's why it's breaking apart it's not hard at all so it's so moist and it's like flopping over oh my that cookie is [ __ ] bomb I choose no good in this one at all so far this snickerdoodle cookie you're the one that doesn't you think you need at all it does not taste weird smell like weed at all and it's [ __ ] bomb like it tastes like a regular acid mother for this ability it reminds me of the ones from Subway next one that we're going to be trying kind of this Browdy oh my god it's like I can feel like chicken I really love the packaging has wheat plants in the background I don't know if you guys can see it but the packaging has marijuana plants in the background I think it looks so freakin cute their packaging overall it like you guys could tell me their packaging is like [ __ ] bomb ass helmet it's cute if I saw this at a shop and I went to go to a shop I would want to buy these edibles just because they look at the packaging like it looks so intriguing how can you say no to this is not like like they're good little cookies so far as you know what that doesn't taste like anything at all is you know weed and the other ones have very very very little teeth I'm gonna save some Sukkot you did with my brownie and it kills super-moist eh like I feel like when I bite into it I'm gonna stay on my teeth whose body is also wrapped in the plastic I think that sausage because heap serves products very fresh so then you never that's one thing that I eat about going to shops and buying edibles because you never know how long they've had the product there for and more than likely the cookies and the brownies they're always [ __ ] stale and stuff and also the the cereal bars their cereal bars are freaking stale so that's family it's like a hair mess at the shop it's a very hair mess when it comes with edibles so mystery baking you know I even like so fleshiness Christ right now because you can tell like when I bought these they told me that they had just baked them about two days ago so that was two days before I had water and I'm not even gonna lie you guys it's taking me about like a week and a half to film a video cookie is still fresh like it's really still fresh the body feels super moist like it does not feel hard nor still at all so that's just a big bonus you guys it's like I am really loving this company so far and I don't deserve you to be my go-to edibles because it's very very hard to find a good edibles especially edibles that do not taste anything like weed Oh oh yeah freaking smelling just like a regular Browdy it doesn't smell like weed I love it I think I think I'm in love oh my god okay guys I have to show you guys this edible I just have it literally has Oreo cookies all over the top oh look at that [Music] Oh oh I just want to lay back now and just chill I'm gonna give these edibles like a good like I'm gonna say because I already like but but it's cute he's really big all is lost I might I might nephew actual evening dude Marley and I don't even know like anything mind you I don't if you know somebody's like literally when he saw him I think he was like three years old that's how long what if I got this there I got this really I but it got this like five years ago and when he saw he said okay I've called him worthy and every time people see it and they tell them that one of my ex-boyfriends gave it to me they're like aren't you freaking scared that there's cameras in the freaking bear and he's watching you like I never thought that but now that you say that like can you imagine I should just get me paranoid because I remember as a little kid like my mom would like she always freaking watch novellas and [ __ ] and I think it was one of the novellas like one of the little girls or one of the girl all the girls they got dipped in an animal and there was a camera a me and abuse my mother is a freaking bear so that's why I'm paranoid that's I wouldn't tell me that I was like I [ __ ] hope not even I really have this stuffed animal like sitting here today wherever I have moved I've taken it with me because this just so dope I could tell Rasta so I've always taking it everywhere with me and she's scared it's like really it took right here and my bed is from right there so it's like and I change everywhere in this room so if I can see everything so if that's the keys then my ex-boyfriends getting a free show almost like a soft wendy is coming up one thing that I eat is I don't eat it but one thing that sucks is like I don't really have I don't really have friends that be smoking like that and the people that are always trying to smoke with me or guys and I'm just like you know so yeah only one of my friends is like a have your last story another one you know some of them don't do it at all I'm the only one that's like dating mother feelings off its domineering [ __ ] but 20 I'm probably so one of my homies he's a bender and I've gone to two sessions with him if you guys have ever heard of Friday night session they have it around the Antelope Valley I used to go with him to go so and just to be at the events and smoke and chill you don't have a good time and so they're gonna have another event it's different people they're having another event on 4/20 so like like I probably go with him and end up spending my freakin 4/20 there and I was thinking of I don't know you think I'm gonna vlog but it's anything I will record or not just do like a little type of montage type video I don't even know what the hell I'll do like little snippets and you guys can see how I Spit my 420 if I end up going if not then I already know I'm gonna end up being I don't know right now and I move this like my hand is like I can't wait to try the other edibles view so the other edibles that I'm gonna do for the Oh they're different they're way different than these if it's candies and they're also cheats and then I also have a beverage but they're different type of flavors and I'm super excited to try those because I'm just gonna say why but I'm just excited to try those it's also six of them so it doesn't say I'm gonna just assume it is probably indica like the cookie yeah I'm gonna still that it's a hundred behind you I'm gonna assume that it is indica like the cookie I never use cookie aware I'm not gonna keep eating it now I'm gonna end up so for the fire they're so good and guys like [Music] I don't like that like I've seen so it's hard everyone at Nicole a mix I'm sorry Peter how I fix the eliminate the Lebanese in their midst our bounce with the water that was fired all the locations when I first posted [Music] lady Belle mind I don't blame them because I had my glasses on and I had [Music] like really really I don't think I don't even [ __ ] blame you days because she looks hottest look and then that's when I realized that so many freaking guys had a [ __ ] fantasy about Velma when they were kids and that's what I was like he got too much I could not do this like my short hair I feel like it gives me like a whole ass other look makes me look so different and they really like it I thought I was gonna be afraid you know it's gonna miss my last Mary but I really hope that you guys like this video and I really hope that you guys go out of your way and pull fit in so down one thing this may be so far those are my favorite but but I still have to freakin try that other earlier I still have to train the other edibles but we're gonna be trying those in the ASMR version of this video so stay tuned for that video you guys and I hope you guys like this video as well don't forget to comment like and subscribe it and we will see you", "U8TWiK1s4WE": "hello everybody welcome to my channel my name is Kristy and today I have a full what I eat in a day on lazy keto video for you guys somebody's showing you breakfast lunch dinner snacks everything I put in my mouth during the course of a day some days it can be ugly in some days it's really clean keto so if you're not already subscribed I'd love to have you as a member of my YouTube family make sure you follow me on instagram my name will be right here for you so you can go there and see before and after pictures and check out my stories also I have a Facebook group all things keto with Christie it'll be linked in the description box below all you have to do is just tap that link and it'll take you directly to the site it is an amazing group of keto people who are on the same journey as you everyone is friendly it is a non judgmental zone and that's the way we're going to keep it okay let's go ahead and get started and I'll show you everything I ate in the course of the day I'm gonna cook my eggs in avocado oil this morning avocado oil and olive oil are my two favorite oils choice and I'll let people use coconut oil but it's just never caught on in this household I'm gonna be making omelets for me and Chris trick here is sitting down low and slow and this only have three eggs it's so basically what only having that one and a half each not really hungry this morning but I'm one of those people that have to eat breakfast if I don't I'm going to literally eat myself to death - not before bed of course I have some pink salt make sure you add this to everything because you need sodium again I'm cooking this omelet on low I've already flipped it and I'm gonna put in my cheese and bacon and also hand the cheese is just mild cheddar and I put quite a bit I like my clothes my omelet pretty just stick together from the gooeyness of it all so I added some chopped up a spiral ham that we had left over and he's gonna let that warm up because we were keeping it in the fridge and then I'll just fold this over just I did enough that I had the bacon I just was not feeling it this morning and here's what Chris's omelet looks like I did put cheese it's on the very bottom tons of bacon and ham and that's it have I mentioned that I am a creature of habit especially when it comes to breakfast so here is mine just basically 1/2 - egg omelet cheese and ham let me go ahead on thinking and sprinkle over my avocado I am doing half of an avocado and I have not done that since my last migraine I'm going to start limiting those because they do have things in it that can trigger migraines in case you didn't know so this is the first time I think I've had avvocato in about a month and then I have a one strawberry Chris's looks about the same except to stuff a little bit more food one strawberry a little over half of an avocado - egg omelet with cheese a bacon and ham really simple breakfasts again creature a habit when it comes to breakfast and look I'm down to my last before eggs I've got to get to the cursory story today ok let's take a moment for a chitchat I'm looking pretty rough it's grocery day I did not want to leave the house I had no motivation I did not want to get out of my pajamas and as you can see I didn't want putting makeup on or fix my hair all I did was get dressed and brush my teeth I have been in a funk lately and I can't be the only one that goes through this I've just felt mentally drained I'm not really sure why let's back up yeah I know exactly why I have been feeling it mentally drained lately I've been struggling I've been struggling with food lately I want non keto foods I want the Ricci Cups I want the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts I want the cookies I'm getting ready to go into Aldi and all I can think about is like their coconut cookies that they have and danishes and all this other stuff I'm struggling I'm having a horrible time and I wanted to put it out there instead of keeping it to myself so that you guys know I struggle to yeah I may have a YouTube channel and I may show you guys my progress but a lot of you guys don't know my day-to-day struggle unless you follow me on the Facebook group or with the Instagram stories I do talk about my struggles there but I've definitely been struggling for the last two weeks and I thought maybe if I put it out there for you guys when I go in Aldi right now I won't break down and buy those cookies maybe if I have somebody to talk it out with you guys can tell me in the comments below I'm just gonna sit I'm gonna take my water in Aldi with me I'm gonna chug this and - right by the cookie aisle hopefully I'll update you when I come out but even worse yet when I leave Aldi the store right beside is Krispy Kreme donuts and if that hot sign now is on and in my purse I have gift cards for free donuts free like ten dollars off and all this other stuff if you're struggling with the keto process if you're struggling to get off all these processed foods if you're just mentally exhausted and struggling with all of this just know you're not alone I am getting ready to hit ten months on keto and I still have these issues I still struggle I'm a food addict I have been morbidly obese the majority of my life that was my drug of choice and I still struggle - and here's those cookies I was telling you the caramel coconut fudge cookies score can you believe this it's the zero net carb bread 349 you know I'm gonna have to try this for you so I made it out of all day and didn't buy the cookies but I did get a planner they had the 12 month planners there's a lot going on in here for 2020 and they were only $7.99 so it's got the 12 month format it's tabbed for quick references monthly and weekly format time zone my goal planning birthdays and special date sections two-sided pocket page and a note section and they're hard bound they're not soft so hopefully I can use this to keep track of some things I've got going on this year I'm excited to share with you lunch today is going to be super simple this is some leftovers that we had it is just some taco soup basically it's just like bone broth seasonings talked of seasonings like kind pepper things like that I put a can of diced tomatoes in it these were I think oven roasted garlic maybe and then lots of meat of course no beans I'm going to add some salt to it I hate to let leftovers go to waste so we're going to add some salt and then a little bit of cheese and just a really simple lunch you could definitely spruce this up with other things that like hot sauce jalapenos I think next time I make it is talk as if I'm definitely going to put some spicy or stuff in it you could add sour cream lightly just not been feeling sour cream so I'm going pretty plain just a bowl of soup today I've been obsessed lately with Frappuccino so I'm going to show you how I throw mine together because you know I like to get in my collagen every day this is the chocolate collagen by perfect Kido this is great for hair skin and nails and its really helped save my hair when it started falling out when I first started Kido probably about three months in I was having horrible hair loss so this is the one I use I'll have it linked below for you guys and I think I have a 15% off discount if you want to use it so here's what I do I'm just gonna use it my magic bullet it's small and I'm using the one that's a cup so I don't have to dirty up a ton of stuff in this I have a little over one cup of ice and add as much cold brew as you want this is strongly brewed and I'm just going to pour it in there to that I'm gonna add 1/4 of a cup of heavy whipping cream and then I'm gonna add also some almond milk use unsweetened almond milk which as you don't want the added sugar and carbs just going to use the same container and that'll be about fourth of a cup also now to this I'm gonna add in one scoop of my perfect keto collagen powder if you have other flavors you could use vanilla in this you could definitely use the salted caramel it's delicious with it also but I'm just using the chocolate today and then you want your unsweetened baking cocoa and I'm going to add one tablespoon of that also my home pull in just a little bit less then a tablespoon then I'm going to add in my sweetener of choice this is just the pure organic stevia I picked this up at Walmart it's just granular it looks like sugar but it's stevia so it's keto friendly I don't measure this out because this is definitely going to be a personal preference if you want it extremely sweet and more in my opinion it's probably about half of a teaspoon and I always joke around with Chris that I like to taste the coffee flavor in my stuff where he would add a ton of heavy whipping cream and sugar he likes is to be a lot sweeter and I like mine to be more okay so that's everything I'm just going to put the lid on this and then I'm going to blend it up I like mine really thick like this sort of like a milkshake but if you want it where it's more runny definitely don't put in as much ah then on top of that I'm going to add in the sugar-free whipping cream I do pick this up at Walmart also and so it's just like the one at Starbucks I'm going to add just a little to the very top and then of course my straw and that is going to be how I get in my collagen today for dinner tonight we are having meatballs and I plan on going over this recipe with you in a future video but right now I'm just going to go ahead and stick these in my oven these are going to go in for 15 to 20 minutes at 400 degrees and you can tell they have made several meatballs I'm excited the sauce I'm going to be using is the Reyes and they gave me the wrong one on my Walmart order this one is a little hiring cards one has six total carbs one fiber so a half of a cup will give you five net carbs but I'm going to be using a half of a cup I'm just going to use a little bit as a sauce or seasoning definitely not that much since they gave me the wrong one so Reyes does have it some sauces that have a lot less carbs than that make sure you read your labels this one does not have any sugar added in the ingredients so that's a good thing at least so I was thinking about doing asparagus with our meatballs but I remembered that I got this cauliflower mash from hockey and I wanted to try this one is the cheddar and Asiago each serving is for net carbs but I mean meatballs and mashed potatoes just sounds delicious and it looks really easy it's got your microwave instructions back here your ingredients if I get this to focus are not horrible ingredients at all so I've been having a hard time finding a good Kali ma Chateau like and since I love all of hockey's products I thought I would see how this one is that way I can at least tell you guys what we think about it and I do have a discount code for a high key it'll be down in the description box below so for this one all you have to do is take 1/3 a cup of the mix and add it to 1/4 of a cup of water a tablespoon of butter and then just microwave it for about 60 seconds it also has stovetop instructions if you're interested but I think I'll just stick it in the microwave and see how it works I realized I didn't give you the macros on this so this makes the seven servings at 180 calories of course for net carbs 7 total 13 grams of fat and 11 protein so here's what we got going on it for dinner crisps is for going asparagus tonight I went ahead and made it and went with avocado meatballs sauce also some mozzarella cheese and some of the collie mash I'm doing it for meatballs with a little bit of the Rao's sauce it was less than 1/4 of a cup mozzarella cheese on top the collie mash I made one serving of the collie mush and then I just split it between us both so we're only getting two parts and I added butter to that too and then I have five pieces of asparagus some pink salt and I put two slots of butter on there but they have already melted so that's what dinner looks like for us tonight I think I mentioned this in one of the live videos my pantry is a disaster I've got to get in here and clean some of this out straighten it up over the holidays it just got out of control okay looking for a snack and here's where I keep all of our bars a lot of you people have recently asked me about the hecka bars they have several different flavors in these they are okay something in them bothers my stomach though and they're really a chewy like taffy light bar and that's not my favorite what I think I'll go with today is probably perfect keto because I want to get in some good fats and this one it's my absolute favorite right now this one is the cinnamon roll so I'm gonna go ahead and eat one of those in case I have not told you guys stay tuned in a video or really soon they do have a new product coming out I am super excited to share with you guys I've already had it already sampled it and it's amazing and it's probably one of my new favorite products that they have so this is going to be to not snack this one is 11 grams of protein 220 calories and 17 grams of fat and only three net carbs okay that was everything I ate today again remember go follow me over on Facebook I do live at videos on Sunday nights at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and I'd love to have you join me for those I'll see you in the next video bye you", "mz1ErSgW1OI": "that will only break my hey if I send you a care package don't get to eat them because they taste good okay don't be greedy and eat the whole ice cream you don't do that you cut it up cut it up I'd slice it halfway and then slice it in half okay do not eat no more than four these let's see that's nighttime think this is daytime if I send you a care package some gummies [ __ ] do me a thing test them don't assume that's nighttime I think this day time I don't [ __ ] have a clue", "yQlPMFGdOHw": "[Music] hello everyone well via weights the net one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about carrot candies I know in the past I have warned you about taking the candy version of gummies instead of the confectionery version I myself have found them to be laughing but I have a lot of people asking me to review candies a lot so here we are with can of candies 240 milligrams of THC spread out over for candy so I assume that means 60 what's the math sixty THC per candy right that's correct yeah it's gotta be okay they've got four different flavors we've got great we've got watermelon we've got lemon we've got cherry they are hard candy so I'm gonna have to suck on these bad boys these are from SC labs I believe is the company that makes them and without further ado let's open them up and give them a taste so if this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way I reviews work guys is I'm going to take these candies because they are all individually wrapped oh here we are they are all individually wrapped four different little candies you can actually see maybe little bits of fruit I don't know something on the inside of those gummies four different gummies because I don't want to break my teeth I'm going to suck on one finish it off camera and finish the rest off camera and then I will be back in two hours to let you know how these things are feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so let's see we've got four to choose from any meaning not a watermelon is up first so canna candies on the back actually has its nutrition information which I like to see 27 calories / gummy has the ingredients as well as you know the distribute the sort of standard don't take this while driving blah blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda I am going to have to gear up some scissors I should have had these with me already or maybe I can just do it with my teeth let's find out Oh God um so that's something good to know I don't just take these into a movie theater or something with you expecting this good opened cuz there is no easy way to do so almost got it here there we go in the mouth this is the watermelon flavor huh taste okay you can definitely taste some marijuana the we taste it um not overpowering you can also taste the watermelon it's like a less intense it's like a less intense Jolly Rancher with a little bit of weed taste to it that's about the best way I can describe it it's not good it's not terrible I'm not dreading having to eat all four of these not looking forward to it you know come seeking side so with that guys I'm gonna finish these here for guddi's not coming sorry hard candies I'll finish them and I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how they are feeling and with that guys I will thank you for watching whitson on we will see you into a horse piece two hours welcome back two weeks we are talking canna candies today and I guess a so I want it right them very highly but this is my favorite candy I've had so far in terms of like non convection airy non like baked good so like gummies hard candies straws all those kind of things sour straws these are my favorite I'm not incredibly baked I've certainly had more potent 240 myelogram edibles before but for a candy something that you know you pop in your mouth and suck on for a while I'm pretty high so I'm pleasantly surprised with the potency on these I still want to did still want to be my first choice I really in most or any context to go with the candies because they don't taste that good and they don't get you that high although this was pretty cheap I think this cost me $8 so it wasn't outrageously expensive so you know I liked it for for a non confectionary edible but again not going to be my first choice at the dispensary but if you're looking for a candy and if you see can of candies these are not a bad one to go with and with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next episode peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "vgqDQOUV_mE": "well hi everybody it's me shutter Scott and welcome back to Baker madness it is Munchie Monday and so you know what that means it means that I've gone out to my dispensary I picked up some edibles that are infused with cannabis that are industry available professional I suppose not homemade because that's what we're here to do today today I picked up Thank You Rex I picked up a little bag of saints and sinners and eaten most of this bag that's why the top is opened up I just want to talk about our package today some of our packaging sometimes they try to save money wherever they can these companies so the saints and sinners these are real generic white bag this back piece is just a sticker it has all of their flavors on here and the ingredients the front also is just a sticker it's just a sticker so they can put them on the ones and on this one you'll see that we have a hundred milligrams of THC new formula they saved this bag the candies inside are 10 ml are 100 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each and then they've where they put new formula is actually a sticker over 10 milligrams of CBD so these were originally what they call a one-to-one which is same parts THC to CBD but if you remember that I talked to you last week the more CBD that you take with your THC can lower the high or the psychoactive effect that's because the CBD attaches itself to the same receptors that THC uses so and THC can't go can't bind to a receptor that has CBD vice versa and let's talk about this not for kids stick or two there is a poison controlled number on here so it's not just not for kids but if you if you have a bad trip you can McCallum they'll tell you what to do which is gonna be lie down try to sleep have something to eat to have something to drink to this day yet no one has died as a direct result of cannabis there is no overdosing on cannabis you might feel weird you might feel like you're gonna die you might feel like you're gonna have to lie down I know for me when I get overloaded I get crazy inside I get real jittery and it's like it's kind of like having too much caffeine and here's what our candy looks like also these saints and sinners have decided to label the actual candy itself marijuana marijuana marijuana not for kids not for kids not for kids which is you know I mean it's okay but it really cuts into you discreetly get getting rid of these baggies you know you'd find these little baggies are you kidding me right now okay okay when I went rinsed it off this is the strawberry saints and sinners this is a pebbles this is my favorite candy this is a runner-up strawberry [Music] it's really good oh my god the strawberry sub it's so juicy much so juicing well alright well I saved two saints and sinners I do like the name the flavors really good you have the second one [Applause] well that's two down now set your timers and I'll see you in a couple hours let you know how I feel hi everybody we are back it's been a couple of hours and I'd say that they worked pretty good pretty good I'm not gonna complain about it I wanted to cover off on a couple of things that's good for me it's good for you and good for the companies that make these candies and these edible products first of all the name of this company is called evergreen herbal you can reach them on the web at their website at for evergreen herbal calm for evergreen herbal calm as I spell that our ingredients today are granulated sugar citric acid corn syrup coconut oil cannabis oil artificial color and artificial flavor that's not great although they are using neem oil for our pesticide which is nice 27 calories per candy seven point five grams of sugar I'm gonna tell you that these candies are pretty good I'm gonna give them on a scale of ten for flavor I give them an 8 a seven seven and a half let's give him a set of and a half for flavor and for efficacy [Music] let me give them a six they are not as potent as some of the other ones that I've had and I know that it seems strange that everything is supposed to have 10 milligrams of THC but you can't control the quality of the THC that is in the product so I don't know what they're using they don't tell me what strain they're using probably many but if you know this bag of candies compared to some other bags of candy this was only $12 pebbles run at 15 some of the other candies are going as high as you know sometimes $30 for 10 candies so for price I'm giving them eight for efficacy and giving them a six and for flavor at seven and a half so these are worth it get some lets see you next time oh but wait I had mentioned that we were gonna make some actual food I'm gonna start my Baker madness back at it so I've been sent some recipes by some of you guys which is really great I'm gonna I've got a I've got three people send me the same banana recipe so I'm gonna do that one so if you sent me the banana bread recipe we're gonna do that and I'm also I think the next thing I'm going to do is infused candied bacon not everybody can get candies at a dispensary I would say that almost everybody out there can find cannabis flower somewhere so we'll talk about that in the weeks coming up I love you guys thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "dqiPVgOSLJY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful

curiosities going on here as i look at this package and uh who is that or what is that that is the strangely named fruit slabs the og mango so this is as far as i can tell the name is fruit slabs i guess that is both the product and brand name uh and the flavor is the og mango this is an edible purchased in a legal dispensary in long beach california uh my traditional place for 18 bucks which puts it on the more expensive and for um sort of gummy fruit snacky kind of edibles uh in this market but not outrageously so uh you but a slight premium over uh comparable products out there although uh this one does seem to be of a higher quality they are um happy to tell you that it is real fruit it is vegan it is also infused uh no sugar added and gluten free uh and like all california edibles this is a 10 milligram or 100 excuse me 100 milligrammer in 10 10 milligram servings um the ingredients just like their uh sort of instructions there uh are pretty simple organic mango puree concentrate and thc extract that concentrate on different level there threw me off um this product is made in a facility that processes coconut so be aware um so yes uh as i said there's some curious things going on here in this packaging uh as i noticed as i was getting ready to grab it for the review curiously uh i'm not sure how well it shows up there the original uh distributor manufacturer yeah manufacturer has been blacked out in sharpie for some reason uh and now there is another sticker with a different creator name on it who knows um not that worried about it and there's this big wks which i guess is probably the you know group that produces these things and with what looks to be hebrew underneath also curious um but cool so uh let's go ahead and open these 18 edibles uh fruit slabs and give them a try uh like all of our awaits reviews we're gonna do it the same way which is i'm gonna review uh this whole product here gonna do the entire 100 milligram dose uh probably it's going to take me about an hour or so to get through them all but we'll do some of them here on camera for you guys get you an impression of how they taste and here we go i was kind of curious to see what a fruit slab was going to be and this was not exactly what i was uh expecting um so here are our servings two four six eight ten as said mango puree they are fruit slabs as uh as advertised at a hundred excuse me 10 milligrams each uh and 7.2 calories so not not too high uh all right well here is our looks like somebody just got home hello dogs hello everyone hello hello um excuse me just a second sorry about that dogs excited they're excited about fruit slabs just like me let's give this first fruit slab a try there comes the weed so these um just kind of like i thought they might be we're like those um fruit roll-ups but uh that the healthy the rich kids parents gave them uh the fruit roll-ups that were like vaguely healthy for you that's what these pretty much are um there are yeah mango puree uh is exactly what this tastes like it's good it's actually pretty tasty uh there is a hefty cannabis aftertaste to that last one let's give this one a try not bad not bad at all and then again comes in the cannabis aspartase but nothing too potent and doesn't stick around too too long either um overall not bad um i would be wary it has been quite warm here in southern california so they may be a little bit stickier than they normally would be um but these are quite melty already and they are coming off without too much trouble but i can imagine on just a couple of degrees warmer and these things becoming a mess so you may want to take that into account um you want to eat these when it's not super hot out uh but you know seems to be working okay for now even if they are sticky and with that term sticky guys we'll determine if these fruit slabs are as sticky as the icky implies all right i'm gonna finish off the remaining seven as i said probably over the next hour so uh and then about two hours or so after that last one i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly if these fruit slabs are as good as we uh are hoping they are right now until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon [Music] welcome back to weeks guys it has been two and a half ish hours since i started our fruit slabs uh from wks whatever that sticker says and they're pretty good um they score higher on the novelty chart than they do on the getting you high chart but they'll still get you pretty high um i'm not as high as i've ever been on a 100 milligram edible but you know i'm certainly feeling something uh in terms of taste pretty good i actually thought um uh pretty quality stuff and the taste wasn't bad until you get to the aftertaste when there is a not insubstantial weed taste but it's survivable um these are nominally more healthy than other edibles out there so you might want to take that into account but they are also slightly or pricier at that 18 bucks so all in all a pretty i'm gonna give it a a a qualified thumbs up for the fruit slabs uh one that i don't think i'm gonna necessarily reach for every time we do a review or anytime i do a um an edible for pleasure but one that you know if it's offered to me i certainly won't turn down uh and thinking speaking of things i'm not gonna turn down i'm gonna share with you a little cherry on top normally we only do these when we really love something but you know i was feeling generous fruit slabs i was thinking you know let's stick a thumb in the eye of the healthy options i don't know how often i've ever done food for cherry on tops how apropos is that so i'm gonna give you the most unhealthy food of all candy a candy recommendation who loves you me also who loves you nerds big bumpy beans probably my favorite candy on planet earth uh what is that it's like nerds but they're like nerds and jelly beans crossed together they're amazing i'm a jelly bean lover but then you add texture of nerds it's great nerds aren't good nerds big bumpy beans amazing fruit slabs by wks pretty good and with that guys that's going to do it for this cherry on top that's then going to do it for this review here on wheats it's going to do it for this whole shebang boo until our next review be sure to stay high more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you then goodbye", "6_bQYy0U-ao": "all right everybody so welcome to our Friday nutrition talks my name is Sam McCarthy I'm a registered dietician with feeder Dale and I am here this Friday to talk a little bit about healthy snacks because I know that's an area that many people have been struggling with since the whole pandemic started and we've been stuck at home because it's very easy to just sit on the couch and snack on junk food we're going to talk about what makes a healthy snack and how we can start to bring more of those healthier habits into our life so I'm going to start sharing my screen so you guys can see my slides just give me a second here we go so you should be able to see my slides now are there loading you should be able to see you in a second okay so we're going to talk a little bit about healthy snacking so I think why we're all here today if we're trying to avoid this and trying to avoid just being a couch potato and grabbing that bag of potato chips or cookies or sweets or whatever is around and gaining that quarantine 15 as they're calling it as it's been termed on social media so how can we prevent this some things that I talk about when I work with clients is your healthy snacks should be planned ahead of time this is extremely important and they should be part of your routine so this is something that I've implemented myself to make sure that I'm eating snacks at at set times instead of ending up grazing all day long because that could be pretty pretty risky if you're grazing and it's just kind of picking every time you're going by the kitchen because now that we're home we have access to food 24/7 so planning your snacks ahead of time just like you plan your meals or should be planning your meals you want to do the same with your snacks make sure that when you're eating a snack that you are actually hungry okay and not just eating out of boredom okay so if your stomach is growling and you're feeling a little bit of that stomach pain you know that's that hunger queue then that's great it's time to have a snack but if you're just you know passing through the kitchen or you're watching TV and you want something to do along with that you're not truly hungry that's the kind of behavior that you want to change and try and get away from just grabbing that bag of whatever it is that you want now when you're planning snacks one thing that you really want to think about is in your mind telling yourself that the snack is more of a mini meal okay because sometimes when we think just snack some words that are things that come to our mind right away are going to be you know a granola bar a piece of fruit those snack foods you know Babs the processed foods that are available out there and that typically leads to a very low balanced low nutritious type of food which is why we can eat so much of it so you want to think of snacks as mini meals because if you're truly hungry and you really need that food those calories those nutrients you want to make sure that you're feeding something to your body that's gonna be worth your while not something that's high-calorie with very low nutrients so think of them as many meals we're going to talk about how to build that mini meal in just a moments but it should include some type of lean protein source a healthy fat or fiber and some type of good carbohydrate in there as well not just carbohydrates which is what many of our snacks are and if it's a problem with portion control even if it's something healthy like nuts which I know this problem for many of my clients put your snacks into single serving containers so grab a little Bowl grab a little baggie you know put them into containers either buy em pre-portioned or put them into those proportions bags or containers when you get home so that way you're not bringing the whole container with you to the couch because we know that can lead to unhealthy behaviors for sure before you know it the whole bag of chips is gonna be gone so those are some basic guidelines for healthy snacks what you want to think about when you're building a healthy snack okay is that you want to make sure it has that protein that lean protein source and and or a good healthy fats okay I say and or because it could be something like nuts nuts have both healthy fats and they're also a good protein source avocados those would be just fats eggs would be mostly protein from that okay and what that does is that protein or that healthy fat is what's gonna satisfy you and keep you full longer so you're not reaching for another snack twenty minutes from the point that you end the last snack okay the point of our snack should be that we are giving our body nutrients and that we're fulfilling our hunger so you want to make sure that it is something that's gonna last you to the next meal not something where you're gonna be hungry pretty soon after that and then you want to pair that healthy protein or healthy fat with some type of healthy carbohydrate most of us just have the carbohydrates for snacks and that's a problem because those carbohydrates many of them are higher on the glycemic index what does that mean that means it spikes your blood sugar more okay so you get that energy you know sugar high where you're feeling good but it's gonna be followed by a crash not long after that's maybe 20-30 minutes depending on what you eat and at that point you're gonna feel hungry again you're gonna be craving carbohydrates so you're gonna be reaching for more of those unhealthy carbs and it just becomes this vicious cycle up and down up and down which is why we tend to overeat so if you pair that healthy carbohydrate with that protein or fat source then it's not going to cause that super high spike in blood sugar it's gonna be more level it's gonna keep you fuller longer so you're less likely to grab another snack later and begin grazing for the rest of the day so what are some sources of these lean proteins or healthy fats if you look on the left-hand side of the page you'll see some sources could be hummus avocado guacamole nuts and nut butters like peanut butter almond butter eggs beans chicken yogurt cheese these are all great protein and lean fat or sorry lean protein healthy fat sources and what you'll see on the right side are some really good well-balanced carbohydrate sources we tend to fear carbohydrates we're kind of in that diet craze of low carb or no carb whatsoever but there's a lot of good carbohydrates out there we just need to make sure that we're eating the right types of carbohydrates we tend to eat a lot of the very low nutrient highly processed carbohydrates not a lot of these good whole-grain or high nutrients type of carbohydrate sources so this could be fruits fresh or frozen something like a whole-grain cracker I often recommend Triscuits it's one of my favorite crackers a good whole-grain bread that's truly whole-grain popcorn is actually a good whole-grain as long as it's not some other new butter like movie theater popcorn is rice cakes again they're kind of like a whole-grain you can find whole grain rice cakes vegetables whether there's starchy or non starchy and also salsa is another good one so what you want to try and do is build a snack where you get one fruit from each of these columns okay and that's how you can get a nice balanced snack that's gonna fill you up what do you want to avoid you want to avoid those those should say hi that's a little typo high glycemic snacks okay where it's mostly carbohydrates with little no protein fat or fiber which unfortunately is a lot of the snack foods or what we think of as snack foods out there these would be like your candies your sweets sugar sweetened beverages whether it's soda or juice or like some of your coffee drinks like they go for the very sweet like lattes or frappuccinos things that we tend to look for mid-afternoon when we're in that slump but just provide us that sugar high and that crash later on white flour products whether it's a cracker that's made with white flour like a Ritz cracker a white bread white pasta and all of the other like snack foods out there like pretzels and even rice cakes that are highly processed so you saw them on both lists depending on the source of the rice cakes a lot of your diet or low calorie you know Special K fiber one you know those those types of diet type products tend to be higher on the glycemic index when it's higher on the glycemic index it's gonna cause that quick spike in blood sugars you want to be careful about those most of our cereals even some of the better cereals out there because they're just so highly processed they don't have a lot of protein they don't have a lot of fiber but they have a lot of sugar they're gonna be high glycemic so not the best to have dried fruits are often sweetened so they have a lot of added sugars in them not all of them but many of them are I'd say most dried fruits are so they're gonna cause that big spike many of your fruits can be high on the glycemic too not to say that they're bad but just eating them by themselves it's not really gonna do a lot to satisfy you and keep you to the next meal what you really want to do to figure out if food is high glycemic or low glycemic is to read the label I know that sounds intuitive right we've been taught to read the label for years but what are you looking at on the label many of us just go straight to calories okay and it's not just about the calories they matter to a degree but that's not the only thing you want to look at you want to look at the nutrients in there so looking at a label you'll see this is the new label that's now on all their all of our foods so calories is of course right at the top what you want to look for it to figure out if food is low or high glycemic is really look at the content of fat fiber and protein okay fat fiber and protein so let's look at this label that we have here the one that's on the left okay so it's a total of 230 calories which some of you would be like cool maybe that's really high lots of pens I don't think that's high looking at the fat okay we've got 8 grams of fat in this food ok looking at the fiber there's 4 grams of fiber and look at the protein there's 3 grams of protein ok so what I do what I tell my clients to do is to add those three things up add up the fat the protein in the fiber so if you add all those up together that's going to be 15 grams total with those three things now compare that to the total carbohydrates which is 37 grams 37 grams 215 okay that's a big difference okay that means that there's a lot more carbohydrates in this food and not as much fat protein and fiber so it's gonna be probably a little bit I'd say medium to high on the glycemic index okay which means it's gonna spike your blood sugar more so it's a snack that's probably not gonna fill you very long okay so you want to be careful of a snack like that or pair it with something that has a little bit more fats and protein in it okay so that's just a quick little trick when you're looking at your label we don't just want to look at calories we want to look at all of those nutrients the fat the protein the fiber in relation to the carbs and the sugar so some healthy snack ideas over the next several slides I have a bunch of snack ideas listed here so I'm not gonna read through every little bullet points I'll let you kind of just graze through and take a look at some of these and then if you'd like me to send you these slides with all these snack ideas just go ahead and put your email into the chat box and I will send it to you right after this so you have a copy of all of these different types of snack ideas one thing I really recommend for many my clients is to think outside the box with your snacks you know we tend to just think of fruit granola bars nuts and that can get very poor and very fast those those can all be very healthy things but we get bored and when we get bored with our foods what do we do we look for other things and that's when we bring in all the junk foods and the processed foods and the things like that so really get creative think of it more as that mini meal some of the things on this page are our snacks that you've heard of but some of the ones on the next several pages might be a little bit more out of the box for you so you'll see on this page some basic stuff you know nuts and fruit not just fruit but having the nuts to balance it or enough butter you know yogurt and Aries - Zeki sauce it's a favorite of mine with veggies or whole-grain crackers hummus and veggies so the list goes on on this page is pairing those things together okay so that you get both the healthy fat or protein and the good carbohydrate source some more snack ideas on this page you'll see these are a little bit more out of the box you know like a veggie pizza made on a whole wheat English muffin with you know some low-fat cream cheese some veggies on top maybe a little tomato sauce or a little extra sprinkle of shredded cheese oatmeal with some fruit and nuts or something in it that can be a snack it can also be breakfast depends on the portion size right whole grain waffle would say peanut butter or almond butter on top of it a banana split that could be like a dessert or a snack after your dinner so a lot of different things that you can you can do to get creative with your snacks and I know many of us have more time right now to build some healthy snacks which is a good thing so one more slide with some other snack ideas here you know a can of low-sodium tomato soup with some whole-grain crackers you know popcorn with little sprinkle of cheese veggies and some ranch so lots of different snack ideas for you guys to get you out of just grabbing that easy process snack food so when it comes to healthy snacks just to review you want to make sure that it is a low glycemic snack meaning it has a protein or a fat and some fiber maybe and a good carbohydrate source not those high glycemic snack items that are going to spike your blood sugar and just have a lot of calories with very little nutrients we want to try to avoid that because that's what leads to overeating and wanting to have more and more and more because it's never really filling you okay it's a lot harder to overeat on carrots and celery than it is to overeat on a package of Girl Scout cookies right so those are some of my my snack ideas I said earlier if you want to get all of those snack ideas just put your email in the chat box and I can send it over to you or you can send me an email personally you can see my email listed there s McCarthy at Cedar Dale - health nets and then I will also mention to you guys if you didn't see the email that we're very excited Cedar Dale is very excited to offer some more virtual options for you guys I'm going to be continuing these nutrition talks for a couple more weeks but I'll also be doing some virtual nutrition counseling Kelly our fitness directors doing some virtual training and small group training so if you want to stay focused and motivated during this difficult time we can help you out all virtually just like we're doing now through zoom all right so I'm gonna stop sharing sleep come on to the video now if you want to say hi and if you have any other questions you can put them into the chat box say hello any issues concerns anything you want to say feel free now", "wc-Tq6C8YWs": "Hi everybody. I wanna welcome you all to a special\u00a0\nday of wellness here at Ohio State . My name is\u00a0\u00a0 Joshua and I am the program manager for Buckeye\u00a0\nWellness out of the Office of the Chief Wellness\u00a0\u00a0 officer here at Ohio State . Today's webinar\u00a0\nis titled preserve your heart and brain health:\u00a0\u00a0 evidence-based strategies that work. We will\u00a0\nbe recording this and we'll have hopefully\u00a0\u00a0 have some time at the end for a little q and a,\u00a0\nso please make sure that you use that q a box.\u00a0\u00a0 If we don't get your question answered, we\u00a0\nwill be sending out a follow-up email with\u00a0\u00a0 answers to those questions. It is my pleasure to\u00a0\nintroduce our speaker today, none other than the\u00a0\u00a0 Vice President of Health Promotion University\u00a0\nChief Wellness Officer and Dean of College of\u00a0\u00a0 Nursing here at Ohio State, Dr. Bern Melnyk.\u00a0\nThank you Josh, and hi everybody. I\u2019m going\u00a0\u00a0 to introduce you to somebody today who is by my\u00a0\nside all the time. I\u2019m going to give you some pug\u00a0\u00a0 love today. This is Honeydew Melon and shehas a\u00a0\nbrother but he's more independent than honeydew.\u00a0\u00a0 She was born with a shunt from her liver to her\u00a0\ninferior vena cava and we didn't know that for\u00a0\u00a0 about three months, but our fabulous vet school\u00a0\ndid major surgery on her she's doing fantastic.\u00a0\u00a0 Her growth is a little stunted from that original\u00a0\nproblem, but she is small but very mighty and I\u00a0\u00a0 just read a study that actually people who watch\u00a0\nof videos of puppies actually can really improve\u00a0\u00a0 their mood and decrease stress, so I wanted to\u00a0\nstart my talk by saying I\u2019m a big pet advocate and\u00a0\u00a0 we have so much evidence to show that pets enhance\u00a0\nboth our mental health and our heart health.\u00a0\u00a0 So why take really good care of our hearts? I don't\u00a0\nknow if you know these facts but our heart beats\u00a0\u00a0 at a rate of average about 80 beats a minute, a\u00a0\nhundred and fifteen times a day, or 42 million\u00a0\u00a0 times in a year, so during an average lifetime our\u00a0\nheart is going to beat more than 3 billion times and\u00a0\u00a0 that's why we've got to engage in heart healthy\u00a0\nbehaviors to prevent cardiac disease. Technically,  cardiovascular disease is still our number one\u00a0\nkiller in a state of Ohio as well as across\u00a0\u00a0 the united states. 600,000 people in the united\u00a0\nstates die of heart disease every single year\u00a0, Somebody has a heart attack every 34 seconds.\nOne out of three men and women die of heart\u00a0\u00a0 disease every year. Now in terms of if you are a\u00a0\nwoman, women tend to delay much longer than men\u00a0\u00a0 in seeking help seeking treatment. One of the\u00a0\nbig reasons women tend to delay more is they\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes do not have the classic symptoms\u00a0\nof a heart attack that men have. You know that\u00a0\u00a0 heaviness of the chest feeling like an elephant\u00a0\nsitting on your chest, radiation to the left arm.\u00a0 Women often have more vague symptomatology\u00a0\nthey still could have that pressure for sure\u00a0\u00a0 but there are some women who also have gi\u00a0\nsymptomatology maybe breathing a little faster\u00a0\u00a0 and a rapid respiratory rate the earlier that you\u00a0\nbecome aware that something heart may be going on\u00a0\u00a0 the earlier you seek treatment same thing\u00a0\nwith stroke which i'll talk about in a minute\u00a0\u00a0 the better prognosis is much better for people who\u00a0\nrecognize that they could be having a heart attack\u00a0\u00a0 and seek treatment right away heart disease kills\u00a0\nmore women than all cancers combined in fact\u00a0\u00a0 breast cancer kills about 1 in 31 women but heart\u00a0\ndisease kills one in three and we've really got\u00a0\u00a0 to place more emphasis again on cardiovascular\u00a0\ndisease and ways to prevent it because it still\u00a0\u00a0 is our number one killer stroke is the fifth\u00a0\nleading cause of death in the united states\u00a0\u00a0 some of you probably have heard me talk about\u00a0\nbeing home alone with my mother when she sneezed\u00a0\u00a0 stroked out and died right in front of me which\u00a0\nis why I am so passionate about wellness and\u00a0\u00a0 prevention my mom had a history of headaches\u00a0\nfor over a year my dad kept saying please go\u00a0\u00a0 to the doctor figure out what's wrong well she\u00a0\nwent to her family doc just one week before she\u00a0\u00a0 died diagnosed with high blood pressure given\u00a0\na prescription for a blood pressure medication\u00a0\u00a0 that my dad found in her purse after she died she\u00a0\nnever took it yet one out of two people with high\u00a0\u00a0 blood pressure don't have it under control high\u00a0\nblood pressure is a leading predictor of stroke\u00a0\u00a0 of heart attack which is why we really encourage\u00a0\nall our faculty and staff please complete\u00a0\u00a0 your pha every year get a biometric screen\u00a0\nknow your numbers and if your blood pressure is\u00a0\u00a0 elevated please take your medication and engage in\u00a0\nhealthy behaviors that i'll talk about in a little\u00a0\u00a0 bit to really help your situation the aging united\u00a0\nstates population is going to lead us to a 22\u00a0\u00a0 increase in strokes by 2030 high blood\u00a0\npressure and athlerosclerosis clogging of\u00a0\u00a0 our arteries are the most common treatable\u00a0\nrisk factors for stroke cognitive decline\u00a0\u00a0 and dementia and what a lot of people don't\u00a0\nrealize is silent or subclinical strokes occur\u00a0\u00a0 in six to 28 percent of older adults and they are\u00a0\nassociated with cognitive decline and dementia\u00a0\u00a0 white matter lesions in the brain can be seen in\u00a0\n40 to 80 of older adults and they are associated\u00a0\u00a0 with vascular risk factors especially high blood\u00a0\npressure and they increase the risk of cognitive\u00a0\u00a0 decline and dementia nearly half of adults more\u00a0\nthan 65 years of age have cognitive deficits\u00a0\u00a0 six months after an ischemic stroke so in terms of\u00a0\nquick facts about stroke every 40 seconds somebody\u00a0\u00a0 has a stroke in the united states stroke death\u00a0\ndeclines have stalled in three out of every four\u00a0\u00a0 states we are one of them in the state of ohio and\u00a0\njust like other types of heart disease up to 80\u00a0\u00a0 of strokes are totally preventable with\u00a0\njust a few healthy lifestyle behaviors\u00a0\u00a0 well why has progress so slow in preventing\u00a0\nstroke depth because as I mentioned\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of people with high blood pressure still\u00a0\ndon't have it under control and we've also seen an\u00a0\u00a0 increase in chronic diseases that are risk\u00a0\nfactors then for stroke like diabetes and\u00a0\u00a0 obesity major stroke risk factors include\u00a0\nhigh blood pressure again so please everybody\u00a0\u00a0 get your blood pressure checked at the very\u00a0\nleast every single year much more often\u00a0\u00a0 if you have pre-hypertension or hypertension\u00a0\ndiabetes hyperlipidemia atrial fibrillation\u00a0\u00a0 is much more common as we get to\u00a0\nbe older people with atrial fib\u00a0\u00a0 are five times more at risk for stroke because in\u00a0\natrial fib your heart quitters and when it quivers\u00a0\u00a0 the chance of clotting is much greater and a clot\u00a0\nthen could break off and migrate to the brain\u00a0\u00a0 tobacco use tobacco use is still the leading\u00a0\ncause of preventable death in the united states\u00a0\u00a0 and then physical inactivity so I like\u00a0\neverybody to remember the acronym fast\u00a0\u00a0 for signs of stroke the f stands for\u00a0\nfacial drooping on one side in particular\u00a0\u00a0 arm weakness so if you have somebody hold\u00a0\ntheir arms out in front of them like this\u00a0\u00a0 and you push down on them is one arm much\u00a0\nweaker than the others is for slurring of speech\u00a0\u00a0 very common in stroke and the t is so important\u00a0\nit is time to act never feel bad about calling 911\u00a0\u00a0 if you think somebody or yourself could\u00a0\nbe having a stroke because if we can get\u00a0\u00a0 people to the emergency department within a\u00a0\nthree hour time period of them starting to have\u00a0\u00a0 these symptoms in a lot of cases the clot busting\u00a0\ndrug to break up the clot can be used but it's got\u00a0\u00a0 to be used within approximately three hours after\u00a0\nthe onset of symptoms so please everybody remember\u00a0\u00a0 fast it could really be a tremendous lifesaver\u00a0\nwell even though we spend more money on care than\u00a0\u00a0 any western world country we remain\u00a0\ntoward the bottom in the health outcomes\u00a0\u00a0 one of the big reasons is our country only invests\u00a0\nabout eight percent of our health care spending in\u00a0\u00a0 wellness and prevention we are always going to\u00a0\nneed a great system to manage chronic conditions\u00a0\u00a0 but we've got to take the time now\u00a0\nfor good self-care because if we don't\u00a0\u00a0 that's going to be time we're going to\u00a0\nhave to take later for sickness overweight\u00a0\u00a0 and obesity is soon gonna survive tobacco as the\u00a0\nnumber one cause of preventable death and disease\u00a0\u00a0 in the united states one out of two\u00a0\npeople have a chronic condition right now\u00a0\u00a0 one out of four have multiple chronic\u00a0\nconditions and what's really sad is our\u00a0\u00a0 children are now predicted to have a shorter\u00a0\nlife span than their parents the first time ever\u00a0\u00a0 in our history that is why again healthy\u00a0\nlifestyle behaviors starting with our children\u00a0\u00a0 are so important we're going to be sponsoring a\u00a0\nstep-a-thon in April and to benefit the Ohio child\u00a0\u00a0 wellness fund and I\u2019m hoping you will sign up\u00a0\nand join us for this particular step-a-thon\u00a0\u00a0 because all funds raised will go to support\u00a0\nprogramming of children across the state of Ohio\u00a0\u00a0 so at Ohio State our university wonderful wellness\u00a0\nteam really is very focused on risk factors\u00a0\u00a0 that can be changed to prevent cardiovascular\u00a0\ndisease so high blood pressure high cholesterol\u00a0\u00a0 overweight obesity diabetes physical\u00a0\ninactivity unhealthy eating and there is a big\u00a0\u00a0 connection between stress anxiety\u00a0\ndepression and cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u00a0 we are very focused especially now during covet\u00a0\non improving the mental health and well-being of\u00a0\u00a0 our faculty staff and students because we know\u00a0\nwhen we experience depression stress and anxiety\u00a0\u00a0 cortisol just floods into our body cortisol has so\u00a0\nmany negative effects on our cardiovascular system\u00a0\u00a0 but also other systems including our immune system\u00a0\nso this is a nice checklist on how to preserve\u00a0\u00a0 your brain health it's a checklist for stroke\u00a0\nprevention and goes through the main elements\u00a0\u00a0 of preventing stroke such as manage your blood\u00a0\npressure and cholesterol know your blood sugar\u00a0\u00a0 don't smoke get active get moving even 11\u00a0\nminutes a day has good cardiovascular benefit\u00a0\u00a0 limit alcohol this recommendation\u00a0\nhas recently changed it used to be\u00a0\u00a0 one drink a day if you're a woman if you\u00a0\ndrink and two a day if you're a man the\u00a0\u00a0 latest recommendation now I\u2019m sorry guys is one\u00a0\ndrink a day if you do drink reduce your stress and\u00a0\u00a0 act fast so this is the website for this\u00a0\nwonderful American stroke association\u00a0\u00a0 prevention toolkit and I would encourage you to\u00a0\ndownload it read it and share it because it has\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of fabulous evidence-based strategies to\u00a0\nprevent stroke brain health again heart health\u00a0\u00a0 is correlated with brain health so the\u00a0\nactions that you take today are not only\u00a0\u00a0 impacting cardiovascular health but they're also\u00a0\nimpacting your brain's health so everything we\u00a0\u00a0 always talk about eating healthy exercising\u00a0\n150 minutes a week getting at least seven hours\u00a0\u00a0 of sleep a night getting regular checkups not\u00a0\nsmoking limiting alcohol use also very important\u00a0\u00a0 for heart as well as brain health so you heard\u00a0\nme say technically cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u00a0 is still our number one killer but if we take\u00a0\ninto consideration all causes of death and disease\u00a0\u00a0 in the united states it's our behaviors\u00a0\nand that's really great news in some ways\u00a0\u00a0 because behaviors are under our control\u00a0\nthe not so great news is behaviors are very\u00a0\u00a0 difficult to change in ourselves most people\u00a0\nsadly don't change unless crisis happens\u00a0\u00a0 or their emotions are raised and then beware\u00a0\nof the chair I so wish I could give all these\u00a0\u00a0 facts to everybody and suddenly they would behave\u00a0\ndifferently but that's not how it works so we're\u00a0\u00a0 always trying to motivate everybody because again\u00a0\nif everybody at our university could do just a few\u00a0\u00a0 simple behaviors we could so cut down on chronic\u00a0\ndisease people would have a better quality of life\u00a0\u00a0 I stand for 80 to 90 of my day and if you're\u00a0\nsitting now i'd really encourage you to stand\u00a0\u00a0 for the rest of my presentation well I have\u00a0\nterrible cardiovascular genes you hurt my mom\u00a0\u00a0 had a stroke and died when I was 15. My dad had a\u00a0\nmajor heart attack when I was 19. I could get up\u00a0\u00a0 in the morning and say I have bad genes, I\u2019m gonna\u00a0\ndie young anyway so I might as well eat whatever\u00a0\u00a0 I want to eat, not exercise because I\u2019m going to\u00a0\ndie young, but research shows us more than our\u00a0\u00a0 genes our social circumstances the health care\u00a0\nthat we get it's really our behaviors that are\u00a0\u00a0 the greatest contributor to whether we're going to\u00a0\ndie prematurely or not many of you have heard me\u00a0\u00a0 share this over and over again but I need to keep\u00a0\nbeating the drum in hopes that we're all gonna get\u00a0\u00a0 here one day and that is exercising 30 minutes\u00a0\nfive days a week you know people say you're pie\u00a0\u00a0 in the sky burn I can never get to that point\u00a0\nand I say sure you can cut at least three zoom\u00a0\u00a0 meetings that are 60 minutes down to 50 minutes so\u00a0\nyou have 10 minutes for walking up and down stairs\u00a0\u00a0 doing some jumping jacks putting on your favorite\u00a0\nmusic and dancing just move more and sit less\u00a0\u00a0 healthy eating five fruits and veggies a\u00a0\nday I start my days the majority of my dates\u00a0\u00a0 with a smoothie I put some spinach an avocado a\u00a0\nbanana raspberries blueberries or strawberries\u00a0\u00a0 in my nutra-bullet I add flaxseed a little bit\u00a0\nof turmeric and bam I get five in first thing\u00a0\u00a0 in the morning don't smoke and again if you don't\u00a0\ndrink alcohol don't start but if you do one drink\u00a0\u00a0 a day getting seven hours of sleep on top of that\u00a0\nthe magic is seven if you get less than that again\u00a0\u00a0 cortisol is kicking in like crazy and engaging\u00a0\nin stress reduction practices on a daily basis\u00a0\u00a0 whether it's cognitive behavior skills building\u00a0\nor mindfulness doing things that we know are\u00a0\u00a0 evidence-based that work if we all just did these\u00a0\nthings we would see so much less chronic disease\u00a0\u00a0 only 20 minutes of physical activity can improve\u00a0\nbrain circulation and functioning these are pet\u00a0\u00a0 scans and you see what the brain looks like after\u00a0\nsitting quietly versus taking a 20 minute walk\u00a0\u00a0 when you take that walk look at the red\u00a0\nin the brain those are neurons that are\u00a0\u00a0 firing so if you have again those\u00a0\nmid-morning and mid-afternoon slumps\u00a0\u00a0 what you need to do is get up get moving walk do\u00a0\njumping jacks just do something to get more active\u00a0\u00a0 so I want to now go over some tips for lowering\u00a0\nblood pressure very importantly as I talked\u00a0\u00a0 we got to get it checked regularly if\u00a0\nit's hot or you're pre-hypertensive\u00a0\u00a0 you got to monitor it more frequently\u00a0\nand if you've been prescribed medication\u00a0\u00a0 please take it consistently regularly you\u00a0\nwould be amazed even a six pound weight loss\u00a0\u00a0 does magic for helping to lower blood pressure as\u00a0\nwell as on the healthy lipids in our bloodstream\u00a0\u00a0 stop smoking if you smoke and that's not easy but\u00a0\nwe have wonderful resources here at the university\u00a0\u00a0 to help you engage in regular physical activity\u00a0\nlimit your salt intake less than 1500 milligrams\u00a0\u00a0 daily don't add salt to your food and\u00a0\nif you're a person who likes to do that\u00a0\u00a0 put the salt away so you can't see it you'll\u00a0\nbe less likely to add it if it's not available\u00a0\u00a0 and then we've got to do all we can to\u00a0\nregulate our stress and our negative emotions\u00a0\u00a0 cholesterol has a positive function it\u00a0\naids in tissue and hormone formation\u00a0\u00a0 and it protects our nerves the ideal is to\u00a0\nkeep our total cholesterol lower than 200 but\u00a0\u00a0 certainly less than 240. IDLs I\u2019ve nicknamed\u00a0\nthem lousy lipids those are the lipids that tend\u00a0\u00a0 to cause real issue in our bloodstream\u00a0\nthey tend to break off easier they climb\u00a0\u00a0 easier but HDLs or high density lipoproteins or\u00a0\nI call them happy lipids we want more of those\u00a0\u00a0 they're the good high density lipids\u00a0\nthat help to swipe the low density lipids\u00a0\u00a0 out of our bloodstream our triglyceride should\u00a0\nbe less than 150 are non-HDLs less than 130 and\u00a0\u00a0 you can figure out your total cholesterol happy\u00a0\nlipid ratio by dividing your total cholesterol\u00a0\u00a0 by your high density lipoproteins so for\u00a0\ninstance if you have a total cholesterol of 240\u00a0\u00a0 but you have high density lipids of 60 240\u00a0\ndivided by 60 will give you a ratio of 4 to\u00a0\u00a0 1 which is still acceptable so tips for raising\u00a0\nyour happy high density lipids quit smoking\u00a0\u00a0 even again a small weight loss can really\u00a0\nhelp engage in physical activity 150 minutes\u00a0\u00a0 of moderate intensity activity a week eat healthy\u00a0\nfats like olive oil olive oil particularly if\u00a0\u00a0 it's cold flat pressed can really help to\u00a0\nraise HDLs and again limit alcohol intake\u00a0\u00a0 tips for lowering your lousy lipids\u00a0\ninclude make sure you know your numbers\u00a0\u00a0 eat plenty of fruits and veggies whole grains\u00a0\nand beans limit foods high in cholesterol like\u00a0\u00a0 red meats cheeses whole milk lard bake broil or\u00a0\nroast your food rather than fry get your physical\u00a0\u00a0 activity in eat a handful of nuts daily the best\u00a0\ntype of nuts to eat almonds and walnuts and again\u00a0\u00a0 use olive oil for cooking and avoid trans\u00a0\nfats so make sure you're reading your food\u00a0\u00a0 labels plant sterols more research is\u00a0\ncoming out on them that they have been\u00a0\u00a0 finding they lower ldl cholesterol those are\u00a0\nfound in some margarine spreads like beckon all\u00a0\u00a0 in terms of stress and depression before the\u00a0\npandemic about one in five children teens and\u00a0\u00a0 adults have a mental health problem yet only about\u00a0\n25 to 30 to at greatest 50 of people get help if\u00a0\u00a0 you're experiencing stress anxiety and depression\u00a0\nto the point where it's interfering with your\u00a0\u00a0 judgment your concentration your functioning\u00a0\nplease get help it's a strength not a weakness\u00a0\u00a0 to recognize when we're under stress or\u00a0\nwe're depressed and to get help again\u00a0\u00a0 at the university we have so many fabulous\u00a0\nresources including five free sessions at EAP\u00a0\u00a0 if you want and need to talk to a counselor\u00a0\nwell this time of year especially in Columbus\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of people experience the blues or seasonal\u00a0\neffective disorder and the difference between true\u00a0\u00a0 major depressive disorder and the blues is\u00a0\ndepression does interfere with functioning\u00a0\u00a0 with the blues you might feel sad or down\u00a0\nespecially when the clouds are out for days\u00a0\u00a0 but the feelings pass in a few days and\u00a0\nthey don't interfere with functioning\u00a0\u00a0 chronic stress leads to the release of these\u00a0\nhormones such as cortisol and adrenaline they\u00a0\u00a0 persistently stay elevated if you're under\u00a0\nchronic stress and they can lead to serious health\u00a0\u00a0 problems like heart disease and high blood\u00a0\npressure well I\u2019m excited to tell you that\u00a0\u00a0 this past month we received designation\u00a0\nfrom the centers for disease control\u00a0\u00a0 as a million hearts university and health system\u00a0\nthe fourth only in the country because of all we\u00a0\u00a0 do to improve our population's cardiovascular\u00a0\nhealth we were the first university to be named\u00a0\u00a0 a partner of the CDC\u2019s million hearts initiative\u00a0\nremember your ABC\u2019s appropriate aspirin therapy\u00a0\u00a0 talk to your physician or your nurse practitioner\u00a0\nwho provides primary care for

skills building we teach everybody how you think\u00a0\ndirectly impacts how you feel and how you behave\u00a0\u00a0 because by the time we're adults we have formed\u00a0\na lot of what we call negative cognitive patterns\u00a0\u00a0 distortions like should I should be a better\u00a0\nparent I should be a better teacher so I ask\u00a0\u00a0 you again to catch check and change your automatic\u00a0\nnegative thoughts for the next 30 days when you\u00a0\u00a0 notice your mood has changed or intensified you're\u00a0\nangry you're feeling stressed you're depressed\u00a0\u00a0 ask yourself what was just going through my\u00a0\nmind is it helpful is it true do I have the\u00a0\u00a0 evidence to back it up 98 of the time the answer\u00a0\nis going to be no when you check your thoughts\u00a0\u00a0 so change turn them around deliberately to a more\u00a0\npositive framework so you feel emotionally better\u00a0\u00a0 we've got a program our brains\u00a0\nevery day with positive thoughts\u00a0\u00a0 our brains are like a computer what we put in will\u00a0\ncome out if we're exposing ourselves to too much\u00a0\u00a0 negative same media during the day we're going\u00a0\nto feel stressed depressed or anxious so start\u00a0\u00a0 every morning with five minutes in a positive\u00a0\nthinking book whatever book you think will\u00a0\u00a0 help if you say I have no time put the book buy\u00a0\nyour toilet so when you sit down in the morning\u00a0\u00a0 to go to the bathroom you pick up a book you start\u00a0\nreading good stuff going in bad stuff coming out\u00a0\u00a0 but you get a positive boost for the day I have\u00a0\nbeen doing that for the last 30 years of my life\u00a0\u00a0 and I can't tell you how this one habit can\u00a0\nreally help we have more research coming out\u00a0\u00a0 to positive self-affirmations can really\u00a0\nhelp with our positive thinking pick\u00a0\u00a0 one every time you put on your mask pick one\u00a0\nevery time you wake up say it out loud 10 times\u00a0\u00a0 saying it out loud truly begins to change things\u00a0\nwithin the brain and helps us to be more positive\u00a0\u00a0 if we could teach our children and ourselves to\u00a0\nget up every morning and do what this little girl\u00a0\u00a0 does you'd be amazed at how much that improves our\u00a0\nmood and decreases our stress now my whole

about Lou that I\u00a0\u00a0 hope will inspire you when I was research\u00a0\ndean at the University of Rochester\u00a0\u00a0 years ago an 88-year-old man Lou walked\u00a0\ninto my office I said nice to meet you Lou\u00a0\u00a0 why are you here to see me he said burn I\u2019ve read\u00a0\nall about you on your website and I know now how\u00a0\u00a0 important evidence is to get things to stick I\u00a0\nwas home alone choking about seven months ago\u00a0\u00a0 I inhaled a tack candy and I really thought I was\u00a0\ngoing to die and as I was starting to black out\u00a0\u00a0 I gave one more attempt to do a Heimlich\u00a0\nmaneuver by pushing myself against a chair\u00a0\u00a0 right below my sternum and that hard candy popped\u00a0\nout but he said I got an idea then for a device\u00a0\u00a0 that if I could create a device that could\u00a0\nperform a Heimlich maneuver if I\u2019m by myself\u00a0\u00a0 wouldn't that be a lifesaver so he reached into\u00a0\nhis briefcase and he pulled out a very rudimentary\u00a0\u00a0 form of this device this was a broom handle that\u00a0\nhe cut he had two paper towel rolls masking taped\u00a0\u00a0 to the broom handle as the handles and then he\u00a0\nhad a Styrofoam block taped to the bottom of\u00a0\u00a0 the broom handle so he said what you do if you're\u00a0\nchoking you put this below your sternum you push\u00a0\u00a0 up like a Heimlich maneuver I said Lou I could see\u00a0\nwhere this could work but why are you here to see\u00a0\u00a0 me he said burn I need you to get me the evidence\u00a0\nbehind this device wow what a character builder\u00a0\u00a0 I pulled the team together and we started\u00a0\nto formulate a clinical trial and a device\u00a0\u00a0 to check this against choking Charlie and the\u00a0\nHeimlich maneuver that's what we used to teach\u00a0\u00a0 well in the interim I was recruited away to\u00a0\nArizona and I left my team to finish this trial\u00a0\u00a0 kind of forgot about Lou and his device\u00a0\nfour years later my assistant walked in my\u00a0\u00a0 office and said burn there's a fella named Lou\u00a0\nfrom Rochester, New York on the phone for you\u00a0\u00a0 I ran the phone I was so excited I\u2019m\u00a0\nlike Lou is this you you're still alive\u00a0\u00a0 he said burn not only am I still alive at\u00a0\n92 years of age but I\u2019ve got a patent now\u00a0\u00a0 for save a life I have a manufacturer in china\u00a0\nthat's going to mass produce it burn your team at\u00a0\u00a0 Rochester never finish the trial I need you to get\u00a0\nme that evidence now at 92 years of age I flew Lou\u00a0\u00a0 out to Arizona and I will tell you that man had\u00a0\na twinkle in his eye and a fire in his belly\u00a0\u00a0 so much greater than so many 20 30 40 50 60 year\u00a0\nold people because he had a dream and he had a\u00a0\u00a0 purpose and a passion well I was telling this\u00a0\nstory to a group of my alums and there were two\u00a0\u00a0 women in the back of the room crying and I went\u00a0\nup to them after my talk and I said could you\u00a0\u00a0 share with me why you're crying and one of\u00a0\nthe women said burn we had a fabulous dream\u00a0\u00a0 to create a healthcare business about 15 years ago\u00a0\nwe put together a business plan we started to work\u00a0\u00a0 on some investors but everybody around us told us\u00a0\nit wouldn't work it would never come to fruition\u00a0\u00a0 so we gave up on our dream and we're sitting here\u00a0\n15 years later with so many regrets and I said to\u00a0\u00a0 the two women would you share with me how old you\u00a0\nare one said 70 the other said 71. I said look\u00a0\u00a0 at Lou you have the rest of your life put a dream\u00a0\nback on the stove again and get cooking while lose\u00a0\u00a0 save a life he died prior to seeing it I come to\u00a0\nfruition this device had been marketed on amazon\u00a0\u00a0 for quite some time I went to check if it still\u00a0\nexists and I can't find it but I\u2019m here today\u00a0\u00a0 to tell you want to improve your heart health\u00a0\nyou want to improve your brain health get moving\u00a0\u00a0 get those healthy behaviors going and get a dream\u00a0\nand a purpose and a passion if you don't have one\u00a0\u00a0 back in your life and you will do\u00a0\nwonders to prevent cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u00a0 and preserve your brain health I didn't have a\u00a0\nmom to see me graduate from a high school college\u00a0\u00a0 go on to have my beautiful family they are my\u00a0\nmotivators when I don't feel I get exercising\u00a0\u00a0 they're my motivators when I don't feel like\u00a0\nhealthy eating because they want me to be around\u00a0\u00a0 for some time to come who are gonna be your\u00a0\nmotivators please don't walk away from this\u00a0\u00a0 talk today without setting a 30-day smart goal\u00a0\nthat you commit to today can be your January\u00a0\u00a0 one it was great to be with you today I have\u00a0\na few minutes josh if you have any questions\u00a0\u00a0 for Bern josh actually had to head out for another\u00a0\nmeeting so I\u2019m going to take over and do the q a\u00a0\u00a0 with you um we do have a couple of questions\u00a0\nuh the first is what do you say to people who\u00a0\u00a0 have tried everything to lose weight but simply\u00a0\ncannot because their body is meant to be a certain\u00a0\u00a0 weight someone who does all the things right\u00a0\nsleeps well drinks eats balanced diet gets active\u00a0\u00a0 but the number doesn't budge I feel like I focus\u00a0\nor the focus shouldn't be on weight but instead to\u00a0\u00a0 healthy behaviors I couldn't agree with you more\u00a0\nsome people's body composition just is what it is\u00a0\u00a0 I always focus the most on the\u00a0\nhealthy behaviors if you're\u00a0\u00a0 engaged in those healthy behaviors\u00a0\nthat's going to go a long way toward\u00a0\u00a0 cardiovascular health brain health immune\u00a0\nhealth so keep up those healthy behaviors\u00a0\u00a0 um if anyone else has any questions please feel\u00a0\nfree to throw them in the q a we have one more but\u00a0\u00a0 it's a comment someone wanted to let you know\u00a0\nthat every presentation of yours that she has\u00a0\u00a0 attended has been very inspiring and she wanted\u00a0\nto let you know that she's off for a long walk\u00a0\u00a0 and her brain thanks you so anyway if anyone else\u00a0\nhas some questions or would like to chat with burn\u00a0\u00a0 uh we've got a couple coming in are there any\u00a0\nresources on campus for hormone treatment and\u00a0\u00a0 balance that you know of for what David I didn't\u00a0\npick that up hormone treatment and balance\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m sure there is um let me do reach out to\u00a0\nme personally at melnick.15 with that question\u00a0\u00a0 and I\u2019ll do some investigative work and get\u00a0\nback to you with who you can contact how do\u00a0\u00a0 you find a dream drive or a job that doesn't\u00a0\nfeel like work what resources are there yeah\u00a0\u00a0 um again I think for you to really reflect\u00a0\non that question I i ask that question off of\u00a0\u00a0 every candidate that I interview and I\u2019m really\u00a0\num surprised but very few people can identify that\u00a0\u00a0 dream right off the bat which is why I ask that\u00a0\nquestion all the time spend some time reflecting\u00a0\u00a0 on that question you know if everything would go\u00a0\nyour way in the next 10 years what will you do\u00a0\u00a0 if you know you can't fail that question is so key\u00a0\nonce you identify and get clear of that question\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to be able to see how you gotta align\u00a0\na role or position to that dream and purpose that\u00a0\u00a0 you have it's like finding your north star I gotta\u00a0\nrun to my next uh event but if anybody has any\u00a0\u00a0 further questions don't hesitate to reach out\u00a0\nto me at Melnyk.15 and please engage in all the\u00a0\u00a0 wonderful programming that we have available\u00a0\nat our university.

tuesday it's tuesday september 1st is it it is see you in september september always still gives me like anxiety cause me like yeah it gives me like a weird feeling [ __ ] i gotta go back to school i gotta get clothes and then i gotta not i gotta wake up in the morning take a shower like this sucks these kids have been pretty good doing the homestay right although when school was out it was really difficult to find weeds so it was a lot easier when he went back to school it was like yes you know i'm really happy that we have this uh medical program since you mentioned that yes it's nice to be able to go to the dispensary and i'm really excited about that dress because it's beautiful thank you very much i appreciate you you are stepping it up and making me look like uh like i just rolled out of bed well you know it's really it's really much easier than you think see if i wear it over top and a bottom i have to find the top two things but this i just throw a dress on i'm always jealous of girls where i just have any shoes on that guy from uh harbor side what was his name dress yes yes he figured it out he's like look yeah this is just one thing i don't gotta think about it i think tie-dye dresses you get them they're like 10 bucks when they go on sale and then he changed his name to dress if you haven't watched weed wars that's something you're definitely going to want to check out it's uh i don't know what it's on anymore i gotta find it on youtube i think um i'm having the same thing you were having yesterday with your arms with with my arms today too times are feeling tight i'm feeling huge yeah but mine are feeling more fat than huge well i know mine are more fat because i'm not doing anything i have a little bit it's crazy how fast it comes back i can feel it already like all i'm here right yeah i like this mic because it makes your memory all my shirts look like a v-neck that's cute v-neck gives me that v-tape around v-neck v-taper that smells good that's right so duct tape yeah i think so the duct tape i put a couple of reels up for vitican and man people love that that that duct tape yeah you know even at like a pretty low percentage i think it's like 13 or something yeah but it's still very much it's still really great you know like um we smoked some other stuff that was like 27 and i didn't tell that much of a difference right that seems to be the thing lately i can't really tell when it's higher percentages i think that's going to be a new thing maybe we do a new segment where it's like we have you know two different strains that are like really different and then we see which one we like better yeah because i'm finding that some of the ones that are lower percentage are especially during the day time you know during the daytime i felt like we were getting too much before or maybe i'm thinking that maybe it's not that maybe the higher percentages are just [ __ ] maybe it's all for me that sometimes just make me tired too sleepy especially first thing in the morning yeah i like that alaska alaska is good we gotta get some more of that that's what dr uh michelle weiner said when i said i'm tired all day she's like well how many dabs do you do like i actually don't like dabbing i smoke like three or four joints a day and you know but i have been taking the rso yeah i mean i haven't don't have any right now i need to get some more but um that definitely increases your tolerance but that could also make you sleepy yeah i like those uh i like the the the [ __ ] strains are really interesting like i i don't know how to describe them but i really like that um that alaska and i posted a little video of it right and everybody thinks it's alaska alaskan thunder [ __ ] oh that's funny and then like is that alaskan thunder foot i'm like no where'd you get that i i wish it was but completely different type of strain this one is actually totally um um researched and bred well it's 15 years of research over in israel for a specific specific purpose and specific effects whereas alaskan thunder [ __ ] is just exactly what it's called there to [ __ ] you up right i've only had that once i've never forget it's one of you know these memories that are just crystal clear you know never forget right i'll never forget my friend walking into the band room yeah with wheat he had just been in the coast guard okay right and he had come back from being in the coast guard and he was like visiting for a few weeks or a month or something right and we all used to hang out in music studios in in staten island there was this big studio had a whole bunch of rooms in it every everybody was friends with all the bands and stuff right and lou comes in and he's like i got this alaskan thunder [ __ ] and we were like what the [ __ ] is that we didn't we didn't even know that there were like real weird names like you know like like maui wowie or you knew like rags but nobody ever had any you know what i mean like you saw it in cheech and chong movies yeah but it was like asking thunderbug that sounds amazing right and it was yeah it was amazing and so i remember it so well maybe it was amazing that's why i remember it yeah how would you be able to remember it i'm kidding i love that kidding kidding so what do you have for news today oh news news what do we got we got considering there's uh edibles have come out i have eight things you need to know about eating marijuana edibles right um and not just you know for the people that are watching the show but for people that are watching the show to share so um i you know i don't see the big like excitement for me personally right but there's going to be a lot of people taking them yeah i think i'd rather just make my own maybe with rso but it sounds that way but i have a feeling that people are going to well to me you know being so body conscious right or you know right wrong or indifferent right i have a hard time with i was always like making my own because nobody was ever making healthy healthy animals um there was one company that came out i don't know if they're still around um but it was called auntie dolores and they were at arc view they got funding um i think they didn't do well with the funding i'm not sure i think they didn't spend it well right um but they created healthy and savory stuff like they had nuts that weren't sweet that were infused right right that was like a couple years ago you couldn't find any of that right and that's what i was saying like how come there isn't like something that's not made out of sugar or something that's not made out of fat like why is all these edibles unhealthy right and you would think california you have like right they're usually like on top of the health right that's usually like oh there's too much sugar in that and like you know like so i don't know maybe now there's like [ __ ] keto edibles out there i bet you there's actually yeah there's got to be but i use that's why i used to make my own is because i could not have all the sugar they make it so easy now selling rso it's true yeah i saw someone posted earlier for the first time they uh made some um infused chocolate and couldn't believe how easy it was basically just melt the chocolate down and out of the i was thinking that your slitter are so and you know it's not like so simple but but you could just take a bunch of godiva chocolate bars and put them in a little double boiler right right should have been there right exactly yeah and then you gotta figure out what to do with the chocolate and not eat it while you're making it it's kind of like you can dip stuff in it right you can be infused like chocolate dip dipping make like cake pops right that's not healthy use dark chocolate ghirardelli 99 right you can add some bitter nice and bitter so you don't eat too much um so i've got that we've also got um the wonderful article you said here we're going to save it for later he had marijuana coming out of his what it's warm up here today isn't it um a little warm yeah yeah drawing uh no i'm gonna change no i'll be okay i can turn the fan on no i'll be all right i'll survive i'll survive i also have uh boomers smoking twice as much as medical cannabis as millennials what yeah that to that that you have an operational word there medical cannabis okay so i'm thinking that that means that millennials are more or less getting cards right i can see that's a lot of uh good statistics expenses good statistics recent survey determined baby boomers consumed cannabis for medical purposes twice the rate as millennials when it comes to recreational weed though those numbers are reversed maybe it's just common sense so boomers uh 50 of boomers uh in the survey use cannabis primarily as medicine 28 use it for recreation only for recreation it's very strange very strange strange question yeah and 22 percent use it for both i would say most of them using it for both yeah because we've spoken recreation is medicinal right and then millennials 22 percent use cannabis as their primary primarily as medicine 50 or 49 use well they change the terminology to weed because it's recreational apparently only for recreation and 29 use it for both so millennials are a little bit more up on the uh crossover between medical and recreational because they're the same i don't know what's so amusing about photos of grandma's smoking weed but it's pretty funny because it's cognitive dissonance you don't expect to see it it's pretty funny um i want to see them like i want to see like a bridge game you know like my grandmother's bridge game but instead of like the cigarettes they're smoking marijuana like this one looks like she's pretty cool what are you trying to say about your mom she's not cool that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying that she's um very innocent yes she's the same like she's definitely got that completely opposite of me she's definitely got that like um june cleaver right kind of like innocence about it it's gonna be so funny that he's here it would be hilarious yeah yeah um i would try and i would love for the moment where she like lights it the wrong way like underneath the bowl well my first book yesterday about the 80 year was injecting they took the pipe too far in the mouth and then the lighter was kind of did you see the did you ever see the video of the guy that do i have a pipe in here let me get you over no i don't um you see the video of the guy that's lighting the pipe from underneath like a crack pipe so funny he's like heating up the bike that's hilarious like dude too many tara videos i know i know i was just thinking that see i'm getting my mic off already is that lighter working over there spidey can lighter yes that layer is working so for those of you who haven't heard yet this thursday we will be in brandon curalee is having a grand opening in brandon and then we will be in fort lauderdale for the grand opening at um fluent on friday right yes ma'am can i say that correct holy mackerels i knew where that term comes from is that just like they see a fish and then it's like holy mackerel yeah we could find out what it's all about um i'll be enough mackerel it's the one type of sushi i do not like it tastes a lot like fish very fishy sounds disgusting have you never had it i eat a lot of sashimi when i get sushi yeah like we go to sushi place because i don't like all the rice and stuff so um i would get like the sashimi deluxe when it comes to like 22 pieces of fish and or something like that 22 24 something like that and uh like yeah it's all like the sushi it's like sushi would have the rice underneath it that's all but it's all raw and then um they they don't let you pick like the type you want they give you like an assortment of selection so it comes with like three of that four that three those three this and the mackerel is like me yeah i have like i've never had it don't get in wasabi and stuff and just like kill it it doesn't sound very good it's good it is good it is no chuck that's perfect that is the perfect explanation of where the cure leaf is in brandon because i looked it up on um google maps and it's exactly what it is it's the old world of floors next to taste of india taste of india we should go there yeah um because you like the no meat i do big feet yeah you know what that's from do you no meat big feet i eat wood no it's from uh it's from uh this is doubtfire the end you read in the comments yeah yeah okay yeah yeah you ready smoke that no come on nope you're teasing me that's interesting what this article that you're going to next pro tips oh i don't know if i was going to come to that one okay i think we need to do this one first okay because the edibles are coming mm-hmm okay these are simple though all right these are like basic basic rules still sleeping eight things you need to know about eating marijuana edibles number one start small it's going to be kind of easy to do that because we have a 10 milligram limit right on individual servings but there's going to be a real um there's going to be a lot of people that don't know i was going to say it converts right yes yes i think we get to i think this article gets set up but i might it might not um yes i think it does um so edibles are going to come out people are really excited about it and i think people are gonna over consume them right um i think it just goes without saying that that's gonna happen at first um it's you have to understand that you should start slow even though you may think that you want to jump right in um here's a good example when the bins tinctures came out right right we decided to dose them just like we would normally dose yet 40 milligrams of that was was a lot right a lot more we felt more like 200 milligrams right um so i would say when these companies start coming out with edibles you take it slow at first even if you're experienced even if you're eating nerd ropes 1200 milligram nerd robes right right you don't know how this stuff is made right and you don't know how that stuff was made i'm not for nothing i've eaten 1200 milligram rice krispies treats that i've gotten on the black market and you know god damn weight is 1200 milligrams in there so um start slow they're going to come out in 10 milligrams um at five milligrams so i start slow and then number two be patient edibles my favorite favorite story my favorite thing to do in college was make a [ __ ] ton of pop brownies and just give them to people chunks in it big chunks in it people would be like he did eat it 10 minutes later i don't feel anything come another one sure here you go no problem then they go down to the bar they come back like 20 minutes later sit on the couch completely silent just sitting on the couch did you have fun you give me some shrooms with it that was one of my favorite things to do shrooms were more when i was out out at the bar i don't know what it was i was just like here i found entertaining very strange uh yeah it's probably it's probably psychological that you just like the attention probably no one was giving me attention for anything else um oddly enough i didn't like sell weed or anything like in in high school very much right a little bit here and there i remember when i was hanging out at the foster house this guy came and they used to try and get the kids to sell weed so he actually would come with an ounce i think it was an ounce it was you would give us 10 20 bags right and you'd have to give him 200 dollars late he would front it to you it was all wrapped in tin foil there's all these little tin foil things and your job is to go out and sell those 10 20 bags and i think i can't remember like the profit margin but you had to pay i think it was 10 20 and we had to give him a hundred dollars right so it was like half price you know or something like that and um we ended up pinching all the bags and smoking them all trying to come up with money to pay back but that's how they got and then like it's so weird like this it's like it's almost like a dare commercial like the guy would come over to the foster house with like 10 pizzas right and it was like you know 15 kids there he's got all this wheat throws all the weed and pizza on the table like how is there not like an adult they're watching you guys because it was a foster house and there was like regulations where there's like an adult has to be there okay so when anne was not there we were like it was it was craziness it was an absolute free flow it was lawlessness there it really was that's why i hung out there because there were like no rules so it was like man might be upstairs on the third floor we'd sneak the guy in downstairs into the basement you know and then and would come down once in a while and she screams and start throwing stuff and screaming at people and be like oh [ __ ] dan's going crazy and then she leave and go back to what we were doing i mean don't forget we were shooting 25s into the doors in there you know like it was a weird place but you come in with 10 pizzas like a case of beer not a foster kid you guys no i was not a foster kid i hung out with you somebody else tell the story i'm like i think it sounds like you were a boss again it does and i only hung out there for like two or three years like a lot and um it was really just kind of like my friend the people i made friends with right were foster kids so i first how i met them is i went over this girl denise's house who was my friend from junior high school right and i'd have a lot of friends so me and my friend radic went over her house to go swim in her pool right and we're swimming in the pool like making a whirlpool or something like freshman or in high school or something and um as kid danny thomas comes over he lives across the street he saw us there and he we had met him before and i can't remember where we met him but we had met danny before and he was like oh [ __ ] come over to my house i got a pool and and you know it's cool [ __ ] he lived at ann's house in the foster house so me and radic went over there to go swim in his pool felt really bad leaving uh denise right that he's the same yeah um leaving denise there and but we were and from then on i just started hanging out over there like a lot and that's how [ __ ] happened you know and then post script to that denise dated this guy matt who lived in the foster house who was like he had all his potential he's gonna be an architect and everything they broke up he takes all her clothes and lights him on fire in front of her house right the house siding starts to catch fire he gets arrested for arson wow whoa and he was like the good kid there like he just like had a real breakdown after the breakup i felt so bad anyway that was a major divergence that's okay so but i was definitely not a foster kid it was just an interesting place to hang out and they and my point was that they had you know some of those dare commercials we're very we're very uh real you know this guy would come in and he was come in with like 10 pizzas and a case of beer and like a few ounces of weed and you throw it and starts rolling joints and playing drinking games like like setting us up to play drinking games and stuff and that's how he you know got you to sell weed for him you know i got you to come back to him to to buy it so if we was legal that guy would not have come and done that and those guys also the guys that are saying oh you think you can make money where selling weed start selling coke you really get some money and that's the gateway right right of course it is of course it is like you said the dealers come over and try and sell you something something heavy or something harder in their opinion more profitable exactly this board is like all wrapped around my legs here the microphone cord is like wrapped around all right so um this is what you were talking about understanding the edible high right earlier that it's different than smoking because you're actually um well i have a funny story your liver is metabolizing it so it makes it stronger a few years ago my son came to me and says here start low and go slow it's the first edible i ever had oh really yeah and it was a pretty big gummy and so i took half and i wasn't feeling anything like an hour later and i was gonna take the other half and i see him walk in the door he's wearing white pants he has grass things on his knees and he's like he was so sick cause he ate too much oh and he was in his bed like so nauseous and it actually didn't hit me right away the next day i was like high all day i didn't even take that much really yeah i don't know what that was all about i was like i went to st patrick's day parade and i like was like totally like spaced out all day wow and i'm passing out miss my dad's birthday dinner oh jeez yeah it's not a good experience but um yeah so he and he told me he's like starlo go slow and then he came home sick and i don't think we had any cbd on her hand or anything he usually lay in bed and just suffer it out yeah yeah you just got to weigh that out and he was like i don't know maybe he's like 20. and i'm like bringing him like gatorade like are you okay garbage it's so cute but you have to remember it takes about two hours it can take effect and if you have a hard time digest digesting it um take a digestive enzyme or probiotic with it yeah yeah i i can't recommend those enough they've changed completely right my the way i take edibles yeah yeah they really really really do help because a lot of people and it's just i think it has to do with their diets do you just have you get fresh you get frustrated too when you because like a lot of times they take ourselves you're like yeah it doesn't do anything for me i mean i would get frustrated i'd be like oh why isn't it working i feel like i need a lot of it and it's just not um cost beneficial to me right now i mean you can take some of it and it affects you and i think just a little bit sometimes but i'll need i need to take like half that thing or at least a third of that thing right and that's just and the for the effect that i'm gonna get from it unless i'm actually like healing something my good side of me like the effect that i'm gonna get from and is like that is a lot why i take it like a preventative i'm hoping that it's gonna heal some or like you know prevent me from getting you're probably right well my father's had a lot of cancer since he was like 49. he had colon cancer and a bunch of other cancers so i'm just hoping to like you know prevent those maybe um and then his sis two sisters and his aunt all died of ovarian cancer right so yeah the the jeans but they all did use the talcum powder i'm pretty sure so that's the connection there i'm hoping everybody used talcum powder right right right they were up with the uh avon lake that's where they were up in ohio they had all the avon and johnson and johnson's and all that you know so who knows what reason they were putting on who would have thought talk about it right anybody that that studied um geology i knew it was johnson johnson anymore i don't how did they increase their profits by 25 percent on baby powder something with the holes or something right i'm 25 bigger right so people use 25 percent more crazy and bought 25 percent who thought it like i want to meet the guy that was just like wait a minute what if we do this and like did that guy get a bonus right hopefully the way corporate world works probably not but how upsetting though you're putting like these products all over like your babies and then like it's freaking poison like jesus what is wrong with this world huh it's true um ah so um they're talking about the next step then the next uh what is this number three number two i know yeah oh no i think it's stopped numbering them number four number five i think you were keeping track before at night so there's basically two kinds of marijuana edibles stuff that you're gonna eat and it's gonna hit your stomach immediately and then there's stuff that you're gonna suck on for a while well even um arso and distillate tinctures if you don't keep them in your mouth long enough they're also um digested right by your liver that's why i think when i went on the west coast um a lot of the like the lollipop 50 milligram lollipop affected me better than a 150 milligram cookie right because it stays in your mouth because it was absorbed orally as opposed to hitting my gut so we do have lozenges approved here so we're going to see those come out here in florida um which would basically be like a lollipop like a jolly rancher you have some uh info some inside info that you're not letting me in on no it's one of the things that's approved it's the first thing okay i thought you meant someone else it's lozenges which is basically hard candies so like jolly ranchers and stuff so if it's approved if it's on that list you're guaranteed a company's going to come out with it because there isn't that much [ __ ] that's approved right um let's see number five six seven eight whatever um think about what you chase it with right so we were just talking about that um uh if you a lot a lot of people will mix drinking and edibles and i can't say i haven't done that can't say that it hasn't been a good time it's just uh you have to be careful doing both at the same time yeah i'm not a big drinker i know yeah i i just i don't know i just don't like the feeling as much as i like cannabis i agree with you i'm just saying i don't know if i've ever mixed them before yeah i'm not sure have you ever had a glass of wine all the time oh yeah yeah sure yeah like every night actually i've been drinking wine lately but yeah no no lately definitely not but you know that's that's yeah that's all it's just you have to make sure that you're interested we stopped drinking wine we drink wine every night and now we just have yeah um i'm i'm kind of really chewing on my stomach um well what happened really was two things one i was like man i just want to get back in shape and two the wine was like that we were getting it was just like i don't know it was giving me like heartburn or something right and then like after a glass i'd be like it's funny because we would forget which ones gave us heartburn and then we would grab it again and then it was like oh my god this one's horrible yeah so i'm not gonna you know i'm cutting back on on like a night cap like on a nightly drinking like even just a glass of wine for a while um i've just been kind of cutting back a little bit but i also you know i'm not like you know completely give it up or anything right you know what i mean it's just like i'm i don't know i feel like i want to get in better shape and it was making me a little queasy definitely not good all that sugar at night either but um i will say that it helps with um getting the rso out of your mouth you take a swig of water yeah oh my gosh you guys are so that we made does not taste good at all so i put it the other day on i'm sweating the other day i put it on a um whopper i think i mentioned this that i mentioned this yesterday i think so i put out a whopper and i chewed it and it got stuck in my tooth on the whopper it was like terrible because we made it with that uh 151 it's awful yeah yeah it's um not something that i've eaten since we made it right oh we should put it in capsules besides that remember yes that would be ideal we just got to swallow it that's that that's the idea just get it past you right but then is it really that medicinal that has a lot of alcohol in it like it's not like bitter to taste you think it's gonna be yeah i can't have that much i mean it's this big okay yeah i mean that's the thing too is that we just drink alcohol so why would it be so upsetting it's just constant it's so concentrated that's why like when we tasted it like it felt like it burns that's what if you take rubbing alcohol and put it on your tongue it'll dry that spot out in there and feel like it's burning gotcha yeah so you don't want to do that don't ask me how i know so the other thing with edibles is it's always good to know your source to where it's coming from so that's you know i like i said before i bought 1200 milligram rice crispy treats and you know how i feel about the sugar so i'm like you know what i'm gonna need a rice krispie treat yeah it's going to be 1200 milligrams right it's like that that um pumpkin we had that one nothing yeah oh the pumpkin jesus pumpkin was like 3.5 grams of sugar peanut butter chocolate i don't even know what it was but it was a lot it was i think like 3.5 pounds like high off just the sugar content oh my god let's stay in my stomach for days yeah i can't eat so it's like you have like a solid rabbit like from easter that's what it's like a solid rabbit too much you need a hollow rabbit see when i was a kid i wanted the salad one it was like the hollow one oh [ __ ] there's not in here now it's like oh good it's too it much is too rich right um definitely make sure you're in the right atmosphere if you're going to be experimenting with edibles um you don't want to well that's why most people were at the bar and came back and sat on the couch because they didn't want to be outside in a bar i mean who's what but like looking around um and you know be prepared that you you know you knew what you you knew what you took you know that's the other thing is a lot of people would forget like oh man i'm freaking out i'm just like don't you remember you ate two pop brownies you probably it was probably entertaining for you it was hysterical to me that's terrible it was hysterical because it was entertainment without me having to leave my couch right i could just sit there and they're going to play video games and smoke weed and watch movies mostly i was watching music dvds and music uh vhs's like concerts and stuff and we'd just be sitting there watching concerts and it was very i went to school upstate new york it's cold yeah yeah you know we do well people would just come by smoke weed bye weed eat brownies i'd come back from class sometimes and they'd be random people sitting on the couch that's how we got one of our roommates just started like just i'd get back from class and be sitting on the couch and then the next semester he moved in oh i wish i could see the comments up there and the landlord would come in and be like is he living here no i mean he has to pay rent no no he's not living here i see him sleeping on the couch no that's hilarious if you're up on instagram we can't see those comments very well so you could head over to youtube channel 710. someone just made pumpkin truffles and peanut butter strawberry rice krispie treats oh yummy peanut butter strawberry rice krispie treats sounds like a peanut butter jelly sandwich oh my god that sounds ridiculous yeah so who's gonna be there thursday i'm excited we are you hear my stomach i did i did we are gonna be mine's gonna start doing the same thing soon we are gonna be in branson on thursday right right and then we're going to be in fort lauderdale on uh friday right which means we're going to be driving overnight and it's not that far we're driving so i won't be driving all night what do you mean how far is fort lauderdale from here it's like an hour no so it's five hours instead of four that's all right no big deal oh yeah that's not a big deal i can do that you want to take a shift and we're getting word oh yeah i'd love to we'll take it we'll do we'll give you the i4 section you can do the i4 section the elevated expressway i love that it's my favorite spot where we like bounce around like we're on uh they're on a roller coaster boat that's why they're so much fun a boat with wait in the wake that's why those ramps are so much fun because you're like don't you see me in the front i go like this oh my god let me go over the top of the bridge yeah we're bouncing around you go over the top of the bridge like right there oh my god it's terrible um oh i can zoom in a little bit yeah there you go so um that's pretty funny ah are we done with our list yet i don't know i don't think so oh hide your stash don't let well hide your stash probably away from everyone because edibles are coveted so uh make sure that you uh know everyone make sure you know which uh which which is medicated which is your population so hide them from your parents i like that i had them from your parents like what's this and your grandparents i ate one of your candies do you have another one i've always wanted to do that bring some over but then i'm afraid that they're gonna it's gonna be too much for them and it's not gonna be a good experience yeah those are delicious let me have another it looks like your aunt it does um it really needs to well i guess we have some time yeah might as well i mean that's a good tip especially with these edibles coming in right it's a good good uh segway uh yeah so with edibles you can get too high pretty quick you know and we make fun that there's no such thing as too high but um it's not a pleasant feeling if you get that way yeah and some people can get you it can make you pretty racy if you eat a lot of it racing nauseous yeah your heart rate i remember dj once was like stuck in the corner of his room yeah the anxiety is like extreme like this all right close the light close the leg that's cute all right but i'm getting the video camera that's cute so there's a couple of things to do um when you're starting to get too high um and this has become this is very valuable information especially in investment circles people that are not used to marijuana right and they're going forward like hey i want to invest in this company let's do a few dabs okay that's not the best thing you have cbd on hand actually that's how i was really introduced to cbd was janelle ralph from palmetto harmony had these bottles they were just brown bottles it was like black cbd and it was thin the oil was thin but it was black and she was like oh yeah like if you're like getting too high you just do like a shot of this and brings you right down and i'm like no way that doesn't matter that doesn't really work does it um and she gave it to this dude who was also at the bar and i took some of it and i think tom might have taken some of it and the dude was so impressed with it that he she he was like oh my god that's amazing and she ended up giving him the whole bottle and um and i remember that's the first time i felt the effects of cbd i was like oh it's not like just some [ __ ] up until then i thought it was just like oh right right gonna try and legalize it like this like with cbd so um but that was the first time i really experienced it yeah so i did see that in the same context um those hemp caps these hem caps are really good and take two of them pop it over and you'll feel the relief from that yeah yeah with anxiety for sure um and then also the cbd rso is really good for that real feel right if you want to feel what cbd feels like try that yes for sure and we joke about the fact that we're gonna have a cbd like station at the wedding yeah no but we're serious you know yeah because that's why because if you eat the wrong cake or eat from the wrong oh we should have the same cake with just different sides kind of like alice in wonderland you gotta eat from the right side of the cake or the left side of the cake one really infused and one little bit infused let's make the cake in the shape of alice like the tom petty video right that'd be really cool and then we're gonna have some cbd syrup or something on the side chocolate sauce yes something um so the first thing you got to do like if you start to freak out is remember that you took something remember that you're you know they got something in here that's going to go away it's not going to be there forever and that's the first thing most people think like oh my god oh my god i'm going to die it's like no you're going to be okay as soon as you realize like a few hours you'll be fine like no matter what yeah yeah then it helps to calm you down and one of the things you can do to calm yourself down and start to breathe and focus on your breathing as opposed to freaking out right and realize that you are breathing and you're fine right right right um yeah a lot of mind over matter yes um and then you can go you know you can't die from cannabis no it can't shut down your system or anything like that so you will survive yes it's like the girl who ate 200 hits of acid as long as you know how to love what i know you can get by um and then you know once like you cut you kind of realize that you're you're you took something it's going to go away um you can start with like other stuff that can kind of mitigate the effects we talked about cbd but there's other stuff like um lemon pepper right interesting apparently um uh it can't uh let's see how does exactly it works i'm gonna post on this later yeah um so the terpene content and stuff like lemon pepper um can help balance out the high so sometimes the high you can feel like you're too high because it's just all like thc so um a lot of stuff gets you know a lot of products play like the thc game with marketing we want to get the highest thc possible right right and then um if it's a lot of it is just like they're hitting it with like straight distillate so it's all thc and not really balanced out with the other cannabinoids and terpenes right right well there's yeah a lot of high cbd strains have little to no cbd um so smelling um terpenes can help balance that out huh interesting you know um and you know we've yeah i didn't i never knew that it was like a uh a way to come down i know the the smelling pepper thing but um because of the carryophylene the smelling pepper thing but but isn't that just like um essential oils yeah more or less that's what terpenes are right they're flower plant oils right you know and scents and stuff so um yeah if you have like a little diffuser or something and you have you know that can help with something like that um yeah i like little drink water that's kind of a no-brainer yeah stay hydrated yes definitely definitely got to do that um oh did you like read that next one and reach for your coffee i did not see that um so caffeine can help um especially if you're feeling too high like that couch like lock stuff obviously having a cup of coffee or a bang energy bang that we know heidi doesn't like i don't like i mean i like them but they sometimes it's like too much like i gotta split up in like two servings sometimes too much it just gives me like too much like oh yeah yeah yeah totally no totally that's like um i understand what you're saying it's like there's too much increases the vibrations of my body there's an incredible amount of like caffeine and stimulants and stuff right right that's why i only i won't drink more than one a day intensifies my anxiety yeah so i often will just drink half but they taste so good yeah i don't know to me they do it tastes like liquid birthday cake i just i don't like the bubbles so much all the um carbonation i don't know what it is like i don't think it either makes me go it makes me burp i don't like my kids don't like it but i don't know like they're like i gave um phoenix some of my like i had like diet like something it was like something orange or something and she was like it tastes good but all the bubbles they hurt my my tongue yeah it's weird i don't like it either it's i don't remember that ever being a problem for me when i was a kid like i just wanted all the soda yeah um so i guess they lumped three in into one thing i guess you're supposed to do these in in order right each shower and take a nap if you can make yourself eat most people are like nauseous you can't even get up sometimes yeah or some board the other way you just want to eat everything well but if you're like if you taking too much edible is that what we're talking about or you get too high yeah or you get too high i know i've gotten too high where i just wanted to eat everything in the world yes i definitely have two and i've eaten that's gotten me sick eating too many white castles at three a.m i have to smoke an alaskan thunder [ __ ] that and one other strange that we had when i was in college that was like white and it tasted like vanilla i don't remember who brought it in i just remember josh was there and we smoked it and it gave me the worst we called it the ultimate munchies still to this day like remember the ultimate munchies and that's what exactly what it was it was just like there was not enough food like and we were eating everything like what was that animals always give me such munchies edibles yeah edibles edibles edibles oh sorry i was big yawn oh thank you i'm actually liking wearing these dresses it's really nice like i said it's easier when you see my reading comments what's the hardest question for our cannabis patient what were we just talking about ah it's like it's like a cannabis dad joke i like that you're gonna use it just in case i got my go-to dad jokes ah so this is pretty funny here's the story that you sent me this morning yes so of course it's florida man right right florida man florida man right indian river county he had marijuana coming out of his what i love the way this article is written it's like i feel like i want to read it just because it's hysterical just the way it's written it's got some great puns in it a man arrested on a weapons charge really stepped in it after deputies apparently accused him of pooping marijuana or something like that i feel bad for the deputy like that's like too much like who would have thought like getting into like police work and then you gotta go dig through someone's poop i don't know if they dug through it um go ahead and read it because it says they assume that it's full of marijuana oh god the alleged case of the dastardly defector defecator [ __ ] that the alleged case of the dastardly defecator began to drop about 10 40 p.m on august 17th in indian river county a deputy arrested the 29 year old man on possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and took him to jail the man was a passenger in a sport utility vehicle where the deputy reported finding a 40 caliber pistol less than four hours later the same deputy where'd my hello oh there he goes less than four hours later the same deputy was notified by jail staff who discovered an unknown object in the man's stomach they were going to take the man to the hospital to get it checked out i asked the man why he would eat the bag filled with marijuana the man said he did not want me to find the bag i feel like it's pretty obvious right all right evidently he didn't try to brown nose the deputy several hours later the man reportedly moved his vowels and there was a small plastic bag the bag was covered in poop also known as feces according to the report i'm not making that up it says that no i know i know it's hilarious i know in the bag is what investigators believed to be marijuana see they had to go open the bag and if you look at the actual police report no i'm not going to it says that they oh my god i found a bag covered in pieces and he cut it open and found green stuff cut the bag and found green stuff inside okay i didn't if i was a uh police officer uh corrections i don't know but i would not want that as part of my job description like when you gotta pick straws who gets this short straw who gets that job well they charge this guy with possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana tampering with evidence an introduction of contraband into a detention facility because he ate it and then pooped it out or he brought it into the facility yeah species all right now you got to show me this part here yeah see the orange part yeah blank had a bowel movement and there was a small plastic bag i then responded a nurse a nurse oh a nurse and i didn't read that part a nurse had taken the plastic bag out of the towel bowl and placed it inside another plastic bag oh i've served a small plastic bag covered in feces i opened small plastic bag and inside was a small amount of green leafy substance i was able to determine it was marijuana based on my training and experience so it sounds like the nurse recovered the bag from the poop and put it in another bag and then the police officer had to open who's the real hero the nurse always comes back to the nurse i mean you know i played with plenty of pc oh good lord i have one patient with ms right this is a crazy story guys so when i i was working at night still and in the hospital and i got a report on the patient at 7 pm and she had ms multiple sclerosis and her husband was in the room with her and i all four bed railings worked which was not really allowed just to at least keep one down or it's like considered like right um and i was like so busy because i had seven different patients so i got reported on her and i go on to the next and i'm helping someone like in the other hallway and i get a call from the nursing assistant saying um so and so in room blah blah can walk i'm like i didn't think so well they gave her like the stuff to make her go to the bathroom to clean out for surgery the next day she had gotten up out of bed climbed over the railing went sat in the chair pooped got back in bed and had diarrhea all over the bed like oh my god how did that happen she's like you gotta come here and just see this oh my god oh my god the one that was in the chair was fully formed oh my god too much detail too much detail visual is getting clearer imagine the smell and then you gotta go eat lunch after that there's not a janitor if you can get no that's not this should be it's great but you know it's something that the nursing horses and nursing staff have to clean up jesus there's another woman who like paints the walls oh jesus enough poop talk for tuesday morning oh man yes welcome to uh tp tuesday uh barry white from cura leaf is excellent just checking out the comments it's just going to the toilet marvin that's funny if you're up on instagram you can head over to youtube channel 710 and there's more people to chat with yeah look at all that yeah it's hard to go all the way back in the comments because i don't know the context and apparently the um youtube is better on like uh desktop as opposed to mobile it's easier to comments i think yes i can't figure out a comment watching it on my phone um we'll be at cura leaf on thursday until at least noon right right um because they're going to do another ribbon cutting right we're going to get there and broadcast from there so we'll be there like from like 6 30 to noon but they open at nine i believe right um i believe so i believe they're opening their minds to double check on that good morning rebecca yes code brown that's funny um then we're doing a 420 meetup yes on thursday and a 420 meetup on friday yes yeah so um it's gonna be fun it is it's gonna be fun who would have thought did you ever think that you would be going to dispensary grand openings and having 420 meet-ups and driving around in a big green bus i did not ever think that no you mean that wasn't your dream as a small girl you weren't like six years old like i wish one day and draw pictures of a green bus i want to ride in a green bus marvin friday we're going to be in um at curley from coral springs for the morning until about noon sorry fluent flunk coral springs all right glad you're paying attention um for once for two seconds right exactly yeah yeah just to correct me okay i'm kidding um uh yes okay john i'll get to you in one minute but we are going to be friday fluent in coral springs and then we're going to swing by and say hi to dr michelle in the afternoon and then we're going to go um to holy mackerels which is in um wilson manor yes and that's going to be at 4 20 on friday yes 4 20 friday holy mackerels we're gonna make some little yeah post about it later so you guys can see what's going on and then john actually that's a question i wanted not a lot we can't give you enough lead time to make plans that's the idea right right is that you do it on purpose you have to do it spur the moment that's how we know you're a real good fan asked about tallahassee um we will be up there sometime in september um right um yes we'll be up there it's looking like the last week in september the last week of this month um that could change but that's what they're they're pretty confident the last week in september yeah that's what we're looking at right now but while we're up there we're gonna stay probably about a week and go to as much as we can up there yes yeah i want to see as much of the panhandle i've never been to the house never been up to tallahassee so i'm excited we should like drive by the capitol and like have a big rainbow yell something out of the big green bus on the pa system legalize marijuana today and just drive around the capitol right like throw out joints hemp is legal in florida smoke them if you got them and just throw them with people around the capitol i mean that was the point in getting a lot of that help wasn't it wait for lunch like wait for all the legislators to come out for lunch yes yes have joints at him smokeless i think susan susan has something or sherry or somebody asked something here it was like a pretty long question i wanted to see what it was um yeah she's up here or something my first flower from cure leaf was strawberry diesel any flower they always have purple but that wasn't what it was right there was like a question or something because she said to all right well just messaged me because i can't is this this one figure out what it was dm colleen and ask about distillate and if you could take it sublingually maybe it was um oh we're about to lose instagram um you could take this lit sublingually i would maybe put like a little swag of um alcohol in your mouth to kind of help it like absorb in your mouth you can't take distillate sibling willy but leave it there for a good minute or two yeah um i think that alcohol like just like a little bit helps to i don't know break it up or something i don't know what it exactly it it does but it i guess that's what it does bye guys the wide shot today so we got like the whole sink over there and everything the wide shot what's the difference between co2 and non-co2 well co2 is the um extraction process the the solvent that's used for the extraction right is it considered a solvent it is right yes butane ethanol i prefer co2 for distillate right yes you're asking me if you prefer it um no making sure i'm saying the right thing here um no i believe i think i think you're right i'm not like i don't want to go on record right as i know for a fact right but i find when i smoke an ethanol it kind of irritates my throat and my nose like a little tickle i can understand that but we did find that the um are so made with ethanol preserves some of the plant material that's really medicinal like the plant fats the um chlorophyll right um so i don't think it matters if you're taking it orally as much as it does if you're smoking it right right yeah i agree 100 because when you're smoking it like there's all that um i mean you can release the residue or what it is but yeah but when you're eating it i mean like the worst thing that you're going to do is eat a little bit of alcohol yeah so you're right right yeah right with co2 i think um the appeal is that you don't have to heat and heat it so you can make these extractions and without using heat super critter super critical cold co2 extraction it's pretty funny because you see these big machines and i think all they really do is shoot co2 into a big tube full of weeds right right and then it and and then they drop the temperature and then they just separate it right and it's uh but these extractors are amazing they really are like if you've ever seen one oh my gosh we still need to do that um if you're watching we would like to do a um how it's made yes mark geez that would be so cool to go like follow the process through like yeah yeah absolutely i would love to sing and everything i would love to see that and i'd love for you to see like one of those machines up close they would i actually have seen the machine when i was training down at cure leaf i was training at the processing center but you see all this thing um we were training the processing center which was so cool it was like uh you felt like it was like a really highly secured area and you had to go inside the gate was like um double and had a little guard house and they couldn't open the second gate without the first one being closed and i had like the barbed wire but the whole thing smelled so good and you could walk by the window and see all the machines in there i didn't actually take a tour to see like how they worked but that would be really cool too that would be we had a uh extraction company come out for that orlando the highlight video that you saw one of our big sponsors was this extraction company that came out i don't know if they got any business out of it right they very well could have been even like one company here you know yeah worth the trip it's worth the investment to come out right um and they brought in they needed to get in early they needed to load all the stuff in they had the whole corner of the place was like these giant machines that they brought in they're like i don't know if they were in the state already like i don't know the whole business model or whatever but they had them there and they were enormous you know it made the show so much better because she was like look at that thing over there sounds like a brewery or something yeah it's exactly like kind of what it looks like yeah we would do a lot of our events and breweries and it was so cool because like um which one is that is that in tampa the one that would go in the back and do it like right next to the yeah yeah that was the saint pete one i think yeah right the one with the um yeah like that the one where you uh they had the beverages thing right that one right that's the one yes that's the one yeah yeah yeah i like that place that place is cool that's the first place we went with the bus um it is the first place we went with the bus of course i remember it's when the bus was white before it was big great yeah it's funny because the bus is still registered as a white white rv i think that um co2 is more expensive hey look what susanna's saying over here it might resonate with that oh it says after trying all the types of extracts i could last month i decided vapes aren't worth it only flour in a jar and shatter wax dabs and the cure leaf gummies i totally agree it's something with there's something lost in the vapes i believe yeah i mean they get close you know the select ones are close the live resin some of them are like um dabs yeah and that's what i think those are yeah some terpene profiles are really good and right they taste like flour but those affect me the most similar to flour but other rapes i'm like it's not even worth it for me because i don't um you know feel them you know um i used to use them a lot more but what i found is that i feel like and it's just conjecture just me speculating what i feel like is there's something missing from from them so what you do is you keep hitting it to try and get that right and what it does to me anyway is it does like whatever effect i am getting from it intensifies that which is usually kind of like a spacey what's so crazy is that there's something missing like i don't know what it is like because you could vaporize flour like with the volcano and you still feel flour the same way so at first i was thinking well maybe it's a temperature because when you combust it it's definitely much higher temperature and i'm like maybe there's something that's hitting at that temperature that's not with the vapes but then when we vaporize in the volcano the flowers still felt the same yeah so it's got to be i still miss the feeling of the smoke though for some reason i agree even though it made me cough yeah you know like i was like you know like i was like i definitely got a hit it's definitely not as healthy what the smoking of course yeah yeah um but like even though it was like it hit hard i still didn't it still didn't feel like smoke and maybe maybe that has something to do with it i like the combustion uh what's the best pen oh the best pen uh i like the apx wax i don't have one here to show people but it's about you know the size of one of these bottles and just about a puffco pen susan says if you want a dab pen you can't beat the apx wise like that or i mean it's just a puffco pen yeah i have the puffco pen and the puffco peek and i mean they're they're nice and sleek and beautiful and all of that but this little apx wax thing i mean like it's got these quartz chambers i have a bunch of the chandeliers that you had and you had to get rid of it because yeah because because it just it was literally you hit the button and you blew out this cloud and it was like and i had it next to my computer and i would just apx ap x wax yeah and if you can get it with the blackout top which is made of metal instead of glass because you'll drop it i broke so many of the glass ones judy have you ever tried the um ceramic donut coil i can't do like the metal coils i hate those but the ceramic donut is really cool that's what i like and the apx comes with all of those and i don't and i don't have one on a used one i'm just saying that that's been like if you want a mobile dab we were at a capital grill right after an event and we had this big round table a capital grill right a whole bunch of people there and um where were you like in florida it was here yeah it was i think it was down here actually i think it was somewhere down here um for an event and like boca area or something and we're capital grill late we're like the last people in the place and it's at a mall i think for memory serves i don't know it's doing dabs and um we're sitting at this table so somebody on the other side of the table decides to hit their vape pen and kind of blow it like under the table right right yeah and i can't remember who was sitting next to me but some dude was sitting next to me and i gave him the and he was like oh like let me hit that pen you know let me hit that thing and the girl over there had just done it so i gave him the pen and the next thing i know he hits it and the next thing you know and it was just like it went under the table and then out like you saw it come out like from under the table and i was like oh [ __ ] we're gonna get kicked out of here and it's [ __ ] luckily it's like we're almost done with the meal and um they came over to like i think we asked something like hey can we get something like that and like you're going to have to leave and we're like why before the cops get here because you guys are smoking weed at the table and i remember just like that i was like all right see you later we're like come on we're going but uh yeah the apx wax that's my gets my endorsement and this is just a bottle of oil not that vaporizer very cool aha ah see i go to like the time it takes my brain to hit the button yeah the thing moves i know i'm like what the hell it's hard to keep up with them uh yeah quartz and a torch it's ah i'm like i'm like over torch dabs yeah every once in a while maybe how you doing i'm good you're good all right we're on um our almost at an hour 10. how do you feel about uh wrapping it up that's cool you're good yeah i got a lot of stuff i wanted to get ready to leave tomorrow okay sounds good all right we are out of here hope you guys have a wonderful uh day you're welcome for yesterday's two and a half hour marathon i know yeah actually my back's not bothering me i'm good no yeah i did another ketamine treatment last night but i i didn't take enough the nurse underdosed herself because last time there's an overdose on yourself right last time i took one lozenge and then we had the conversation upstairs i only brought one upstairs and i'm like i wonder how many milligrams that is and i convinced myself it's got to be 200 but it was only 100 so i didn't take enough right but i do feel like um the pain is not bothering me today i think it's really good for nerve pain yeah it's interesting yeah it really is i mean i haven't done anything since yesterday about that and my nerve is usually like like irritating the [ __ ] out of me that's really interesting at this point in time but yeah i know i'm good cool yeah i'm looking forward to something i'm looking forward to my knees being healed and my shoulders and yes yeah thank you too brad enjoy your days everybody yeah you should try them yeah all right guys have a wonderful day we'll see you tomorrow", "JsbtCmyJR58": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "DxVx5My-Zkc": "hey guys welcome to taste of love i'm marine and today we are making jolly rancher candy grapes so before we get started go ahead and give this video a thumbs up click on the subscribe button and turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time a new video drops so let's go ahead and get started okay so here we have our supplies we have our cairo syrup white food coloring blue food coloring toothpicks jolly rancher grapes and a one cup measuring cup so before we get started we're going to prep our grapes our grapes have already been washed and dried they would drive using a paper towel and now we're going to insert the toothpicks into our grapes so that we can dip them in the candy now when it comes to dipping the toothpicks when it comes to putting the toothpicks into the grapes you can't put it where you remove the grape from the stem on this side you put it on the opposite side on the bottom so you run the toothpick through the bottom of the grate so that when you shake it and you dip it it won't fall off so we're going to insert our toothpicks into all of our grapes make sure you go through your bag of grapes really carefully because a lot of the time some of the grapes are rotten and they're deforming so you don't want to dip those grapes into candy so we're going to stick them all and then you want to put the toothpick not just a little bit in so that when you go like that it'll fall off but more all the way in so when you shake it because you would have to shake off that excess candy it wouldn't fall off [Music] and then you put it all the way in so that it's sturdy so that it really holds onto the grate you can use any other food color that you want also i'm using blue because i wanted mine to be blue and i'm going to flavor it with the blue jolly rancher candies also [Applause] but i'm going to show you guys that in one second so you also need your thermometer and a deep size pot because sometimes your candy batter does bubble up for this recipe we're doing the four one one method so we're using four cups of sugar 1 cup of carrot syrup and 1 cup of water now if you do put your toothpick all the way through and it comes through the top it doesn't matter because when you slip it out after you dip it in candy it'll still come easily out [Music] [Applause] okay so right now we're going to add our ingredients to the pot to make our candy batter so we're gonna add four cups of sugar [Music] one cup of water [Music] and our cairo syrup [Music] now i'm going to add a few drops of white food coloring [Music] and i'm also going to add the blue and just two drops of the blue now i'm going to start my stove and turn it up to 7.5 so that my candy batter can cook and we're going to leave our candy batter to cook until it gets to 300 degrees okay you see the the colors is getting all mixed up on its own this is why i don't mix it because i like when it gets mixed from cooking it gets a more even mixture then if you try to mix it up but that's just what i like so this is why i didn't mix it when i put the colors in [Music] [Music] all right our candy has finished cooking it's gotten to 300 degrees look at how pretty that blue is so we're gonna take our pot off of the hot stove and then we're gonna get ready to dip our grapes okay so i have my pot angled to the side it's leaning on the stove just so that the angle would be i guess kind of able to tilt all my batter down so that i can get it and what i have here is my food processor which i'm going to crush up my jolly ranchers with so i'm just going to drop some of the jolly ranchers into my food processor and crush them up real quick and the reason i wait for my candy to be done cooking while i do this is because i don't want my um my candy to my well not my candy not my candy batter but the jolly rancher candies to get sticky and stick together and then it's hard to use so i'm just going to drop them in here really quick and blend it up so i'm opening my blue candy first because what i'm going to do is take this blue candy and drop it into my candy batter so that it'll flavor it i'm just putting two of them in here the candy is hot [Music] so it will melt it [Music] so now i'm going to drop my jolly ranchers in here really quickly so we could just crush them up if you don't have a food processor you can put them in three ziploc bags i will triple bag it and then use a rolling pin and crush it [Music] that method has worked for me personally for a little while before i started putting it in the fruit processor the food processor just makes it more fine and more dusted than really chunky and i like it finer than more chunkier because if you ever ate candy grapes you know that when you put it in your matcha bite into it if it's really chunky it can like scratch the top of your mouth and it's really painful so i'm just putting all my candy in here [Music] and i don't really need a lot because we only did a little bit of grapes [Music] okay so i have all the jolly ranchers that i want in here now i am going to turn it on so we can crush these up [Music] there we go nice and fine now i'm going to take them and pour them out into a little bowl so that we can go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy mixture and add jolly ranchers to move this inside nice and crushed so now we're going to go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy okay so here's my grape i'm going to dip it into my candy shake it off and roll it into my genre and there we go that's how it's going to look here now let's dip all of them shake it off you don't want to exist and also i use a spoon to keep the jolly rancher constantly mixed you can use a fork so it doesn't really matter because if you let your jolly rancher sit still it will start pumping up and get hard [Music] and i would suggest putting them in the refrigerator immediately after dipping [Music] i do suggest putting your candy grapes in the refrigerator immediately after dipping because it does get sticky and it starts melting almost immediately candy grapes is one of the fruits that will melt really really fast like really really fast from the minute you dip the grapes into the candy it starts to melt because grapes are a water-based fruit so they don't last very long you can put your grapes in the freezer after you dip them to try to lengthen how long they last but it does not lengthen it by much maybe by just a couple hours and putting it in the freezer would not change the taste it would still have the same great taste so we're going to go ahead and keep dipping and then add the jolly ranchers too [Music] look at how pretty that color is now the reason we add white food coloring is so that the color does not become transparent if you don't add white food coloring to your candy your candy will be transparent meaning that you can see right through and you can see your fruit like if you guys remember in the candy tangerine video we didn't use any color so the candy was clear your candy will be clear with like a light color if you don't put the white food coloring in the white food coloring is what gives it the background basically so that your grapes can turn into a different color so they won't be like you know green with a light blue look and i've tried dipping red grapes however red grapes are really really really sweet so they're not as tasty as using green grapes i think it's more delicious with the green grapes because the sweetness weighs out with the sour to give it a nice taste but with the red grapes it's just overly sour and i mean overly sweet i apologize it's just overly sweet so it's not really [Music] that good because to me too much sweet just takes all the flavor away from it [Music] i was about to dip it in the jolly rancher without putting it in the candy bag [Music] and you see how good our toothpick comes in handy um you can use skewers if you want to um i think the skewers are too long personally i don't like using screwers that's why i choose the toothpick method but there's like a different way for everything and i tell you guys this all the time i teach you guys what works for me i like showing you guys what i like to do there's always a different way for everything i just show you my way and what works for me because you can do it and say oh i don't like her way of doing this i like this way better and that is perfectly fine because there's always a million different ways to do stuff [Music] so my jolly ranchers are almost finished i'm just going to [Music] start using my spoon so i can pick up if you wanted to add a flavor to your candy also you can use the lorraine's flavor oil and you can add that instead of adding the jolly rancher like i did i wanted my jolly rancher flavor since we're using jolly ranchers and their decorations [Music] i'm running out of space [Music] let's just give them a flat bottom instead of a flat back and then you have to dip these real fast also because depending on the temperature of your house the candy batter will start to harden really fast because these are hard crack candy that's why we get it to 300 degrees 300 degrees is the point of hard crack [Music] it's how a lollipop would be you can use the same batter to make lollipops also and of course if you guys try this and i would love to see what you guys did so take a picture and tag me on instagram my instagram is in the description if you guys make these you had problems with them it was easy um whatever happened just let me know leave me a comment let me know if you liked it if it was delicious just let me know how it turned out i would love to hear from you guys [Music] and you see that the jolly rancher candy is already [Music] [Music] the whole time [Music] okay so we're almost done [Music] then i'm going to show you guys how to easily slip your toothpicks off and get ready to serve them eat them enjoy them put them in the refrigerator um if you're saving them for later later like you don't want to eat them right right now put them in the freezer so that they don't start breaking down as fast because they do break down very very quickly very very quickly like i believe candy grapes only last i think a maximum of about two to three hours depending on how you make them depending on the time of the year um to me i find that they last longer in the time because it's colder depending on how hot you keep your house also um in the summertime if you have them outside they will almost melt immediately and the same thing goes for your candy apples also they melt really quickly i'm gonna sprinkle it some of my candy is still on wet most of it has already dry and hardened it gets hard almost immediately after dipping them they dry really really quickly okay we're down to our last three grapes so now we're going to get ready to start pulling off our toothpicks from our grapes and separating it last two roll it in my jolly rancher last one i'm gonna cover it in our jolly rancher there we go [Music] all right so there we go now we're going to slide them off of our [Music] toothpicks and i'm going to put them [Music] and you can tell that the candy is hard when you squeeze it it doesn't get soft or squishy [Music] and that's how it looks when you like into it [Music] it's really crunchy and there we go jolly rancher candy grapes if you enjoyed today's video go ahead and give this video a thumbs up subscribe and make sure you turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time we upload a video and of course if you have questions leave it in the comments and i'll be happy to answer you guys see you guys later", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "vgWlkfz2hsc": "[Music] hey guys so today today i'm going to be taking a 200 milligram edible and do my makeup oh yeah i just got out the shower so i have a baggy t-shirt on and my hair is wet obviously the edibles that i'm going to take i took out the little card but this is the edible i already took these three but with these three i cut them in half i took one hole like a couple days ago [ __ ] is crazy but the other two i cut them in half and like took half the dose but this is a 200 milligram edible um this is the card it literally says this super potent gummy is 200 milligrams strong the company suggests that patients should begin with one candy at a time and adjust as they become familiar with the effects this product is segmented into four candies so dosage can be well managed i'm going to take the edible now but it does take an hour to activate so i'm going to eat the edible on camera chill my bed time it for an hour and come back an hour and doing makeup so that's what we're gonna do the only thing i don't like about these gummies is that it's a little hard to chew it's super super hard but honestly like they're nuts so this is it it's obviously like lemon flavor and it's a little alien the freaking alien design should say how like strong it is but [Music] like i can't even chew it i have to really just pluck on it but i'm gonna put coconut oil in my hair oh my god i'm gonna cut the video because i'm gonna be chewing this for the next 10 minutes because this is how hard it is i'll see you in an hour it is 12 30 right now so i'll see ya at 1 30. okay so it's been an hour um yeah all right so i'm gonna start doing my makeup all right i'm not even gonna lie when i'm when i'm high my voice gets really low like really really low so that's just yeah okay i want to play music so bad right now because i love like listening to music when i'm high but i'm gonna get copyrighted i'm doing my eyebrows with this palette even though i have my mirror in front of me um i'm gonna use this mirror because it's closer and my eyebrows need to be precise i've done my makeup hard before but like it always comes out like fine all right so what should i talk about because i don't want to just stay here silently oh almost look about the first time i got high okay i don't remember [ __ ] okay so when i first got high it was [Music] pretty sure was my 18th birthday i think it was like after it was like a week after my 18th birthday at the time one of my close friends at the time she had already like smoked she was already like into it so she knew what she was doing um and her best friend like also like my friend her best friend and her sister so they all like knew what they were doing already um i had always been like really nervous to get high because i was like i don't know how i'm gonna act i don't know like how i'm feel because you can explain to people how it feels but you don't know what it feels like until you feel it oh i was like i already had like my like like i guess my my stigma about it i don't know i had my own opinions about it but i was like [ __ ] it i'm 18 like let me just try at least i wanted to at least try it because i was like okay then i can know if i like it or not i went to her house and i don't know i don't remember if we planned on doing it or not but i think they had planned on doing it and i was just gonna like chill out but then eyebrow okay i said i do my makeup better when i'm high but my eyebrows coming out a little funky so whatever she lives like five minutes away from me not even like a two second walk and i'm at her house so i got to her house and they started to smoke and we were all in a circle they were so we were like a little diamond i guess and i was sitting there like hella nervous because i was like yo i said oh my god when i was like nervous because i was like am i gonna do this right like am i gonna smoke this right until i was like what's gonna happen to me i was like [ __ ] up so i think i think me having anxiety prior to even smoking is what caused my experience so i was like freaking out whatever and it gets past me and like they spent like five minutes trying to teach me how to do it right because we had done it before the first time i really really smoked i didn't do it right so i felt a little bit but i didn't feel like anything compared to the time i'm talking about right now did that make sense so whatever they spent like five minutes trying to like teach me how to do it and i was convinced i wasn't doing it right i was like nah i'm not doing this right i don't feel [ __ ] because in my head i'm thinking oh it's supposed to be like an immediate feeling because when they were doing when my friends were doing it they i could already tell they were snacks i was like what the [ __ ] so whatever i passed this for her sister circle kept going right it goes to i don't know if they care if i use their name and i'm just saying that i'm like i'm like this like i'm like yo what's happening right now and i'm like i'm not realizing that that's what i'm feeling that i'm feeling hot in my head i'm thinking like am i laced because i didn't know that that was the feeling you got they when they explained to me that you felt like what i what you would feel what i would feel i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm chatting about right now they were like basically saying you feel calm you feel high like they don't know how else to explain it because it's like i don't you don't really know how to explain it to a person i'm too smack right now um where was i oh yeah so it gets past and i'm sitting there like confused as to what's going on because i didn't know that that that feeling i was feeling was the feeling i was feeling high so i'm sitting there like yo guys i'm like freaking out and i go i think i go on the bed and i just sit and i'm like i'm like looking out the window i'm like yo i like in that moment it felt like i was in heaven but because the sun was sitting and it was coming through her window so i'm looking at the sun like so i'm looking out the window like yo i'm in heaven right now and they're just laughing at me because i was saying like nonsense it did y'all i feel like this looks bad they were just laughing at me because i was saying like a bunch of nonsense and i don't have the video from that day because it was in my old snap and everything i deleted but um i was basically like just bugging out i was like i feel like i'm talking to computers going off and they were like yo are you good and i was like i was like no i like i knew i wasn't good i wasn't good to where i was like unsafe but i wasn't good because i like i wasn't comprehending that this is what you feel it was my first time one and two i didn't know like what to expect [Music] so in my mind i'm convinced at that point i'm convinced i just got leased and it's not i wasn't thinking that because of them or anything i was thinking that because again i didn't know that that was how i was supposed to feel so so i was asking them i was like yo is mine different like i don't know i was like yo did i smoke something different because i don't know like i feel crazy i was saying like i feel crazy because everything was just like yo okay that took a lot of concentration she asked me she was like is this your first time getting house like like yes bro i was so like frustrated because i was like i was like oh my god i was like i don't know what to do they were living their best life they were enjoying it but i was just so paranoid and i wasn't enjoying it at all like it honestly it really wasn't a fun experience for me because my anxiety was just like getting the best of me i was just getting hella paranoid and my anxiety was just through the roof and i was just sitting in the corner like yo like i wasn't crying but in my head i was because i was like oh my gosh and then like when it like hit me that this is like me being high what was i saying i forgot what the [ __ ] i was saying oh yeah i was like i was just hella paranoid i like i didn't know what to do with myself and at one point i was like when does this end i was asking them like yo when does this [ __ ] end because i just didn't want to be high anymore i was like i'm over this like this is no um and they were like give it like another like four or five hours because like at the time i had never smoked before so it was gonna last a long time not smoke that much compared to now if i would have smoked that now i would have been like okay like can i get another one that was my first time getting high i was hella paranoid i had hella anxiety i told some of my friends the story they're like they're like so if you had that bad experience why do you continue to smoke and like [Music] eat edibles on [ __ ] camera for youtube um honestly i tried it again after that because i was like i was like okay i need to have a better experience because i truly feel like in that moment all i was doing was just panicking and like questioning everyone and like just acting like annoying so i was like okay i want to experience this again because i want to learn how to just like be okay and just enjoy it instead of like freaking the [ __ ] out so i ended up trying it again and the second time it was the second time the second time was a way better experience it was a lot more fun we actually went out and did stuff so i was cool what gets me tight when i meet people and i'm like oh like do you smoke heavy smoke before they're like yeah i've smoked before but i i didn't feel anything so it don't work for me i'd be like i mean i'd be like wrap it up because i'd be like one it's either you didn't smoke it right or two you didn't have actual weed because no you didn't have good weed i'm like i mean i says you didn't feel anything because you didn't smoke it right because if it's me if you're smoking weed you're gonna feel something especially if it's your first time so you death didn't do it right and i would know because the first actual time i did it i didn't do it right and i barely felt that i had like the giggles more because i was like oh my god how but like i didn't feel [ __ ] because i didn't do it right so that's why when people always say that [ __ ] i'm like i'm gonna teach you i'll be like i'm gonna teach you [ __ ] like i got you [Music] that water tastes so good i felt it okay so i'm gonna take laura mercier and set the concealer on my eyes i'm getting the munchies i was gonna order food while i was waiting but then i was like i was like no i want to wait so um like snack snack so i could crave food [Music] see now i was starting to hit like a brick before i was a little high i know i could have been hired and i was starting to hit me like a ton of bricks oh my god i don't know what i'm doing i don't know what i'm doing okay i'm gonna take this kylie bronzer [Music] and use it as a little eyeshadow to dust off the translucent powder [Music] the indian asked oh what the indian clay mask i need to do that oh i could talk about the story the time i took my first edible too that story was crazy first time i tried edible rape my friend that made it for me and my mom they were both telling me they were like this is your first time eating edible so be careful just eat half and i was like alright yeah i was like i know like i was trying to act all big and bad like yeah i know like i'm just gonna eat half i saved it for like a day or two because i was like i want to wait to like so i know i don't have anything to do the whole day because if this is my first time i want to be home chilling whatever so i was home i ate the edible i had half like he said and then i was just sitting there and it's been 20 minutes wow i was just sitting there and i wasn't feeling anything like an hour pass and i wasn't feeling anything i was like i was like hello i was getting mad because i was like this is not working for me that's everyone's [ __ ] mistake when they take edibles it doesn't work for me it's not hidden [ __ ] i was just chilling and i was like you know what i'm gonna eat more so i practically ate the whole thing i left like a little slither left i ate the whole thing basically and i was like this should do it idiot not realizing what it's actually gonna do to me 30 minutes later it all hit at once and i was bugging out i ate like two no i ate a full down on those pizza i had wings i had a lava cake i had all that i had lava cake i had soda and i ate it all and i'm getting hungry my mom i knew i had ate half so she was just waiting so she came into my room like an hour after it officially hit me she was like you good i was like i was like i feel like i have super powers and she starts busting out laughing and i swore in that moment i had super hours and i was just like okay i'm bored i want to do something i was like really jumpy pretty sure because it it was sativa yeah i was like i want to do something i wanna like i wanna party so i started making i probably made like 20 dance videos that night of me just dancing in my bed and it wasn't even like real like choreography dancing i was just i was just filming myself doing like my goofy [ __ ] because when i when i add goofy i'll be doing nuts i look like crackit i literally convinced myself i was like i'm trapped here i'm never gonna be able to leave oh my god what the [ __ ] and then like as quick as it was for me to have those thoughts like even quicker for me to just get rid of those thoughts like i was thinking that and i was like oh my gosh i can't get up and then i was like [ __ ] yes you can and i was like just get up and i got up i ate the rest of whatever i didn't eat from domino's and i knocked out that sleep hit so different that was probably the best sleep i've ever had someone if someone i didn't that didn't

say [Music] excuse me thank you guys for watching", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day folks hope you enjoyed the video take care love and honey's flower child signing off have a great day stay true and stay unique bye Mase hope you enjoyed the video my friend", "wWk3K2ssAXg": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey welcome back to my channel my name's myra if you're new welcome don't forget to subscribe so you can be notified every time that i upload a video and today i am going to be sharing with you how to make a breakable jolly rancher heart with a little bit of a kick to it so if you've ever worked with hard candy you know that usually you have to work pretty fast so i'm going to share everything that you're going to need that way you don't forget about anything and i'll take you guys over to my kitchen so the first thing you're going to need is of course jolly ranchers i've got two of these bags and they are the hard candy make sure these are hard candy because if you get the chewable ones it won't work for a recipe and this one has four different types of flavors so cherry strawberry watermelon and fruit punch you can mix and match or just do a single flavor you're going to need some corn syrup and this is a brand that i got you can use any brand it really doesn't matter if you have a hard time looking for this i will link it down below for you and you can also find it where the breakfast section is where all of the pancake syrups are at it's normally next to that just in case you have a hard time looking for it and then you're also going to need some tajin you're also going to need water and sugar i will be giving you exact measurements as we use them so now it's time to take you guys to my kitchen i bought two bags of jolly ranchers and for this video i'm going to try and use watermelon only if i do add a different flavor i'll let you guys know [Music] so for my jolly ranchers i'm going to separate them by flavor [Applause] and i have a total of 33 candies that i will be using to make a breakable heart so we're going to start by pouring in our jolly ranchers one tablespoon of our corn syrup [Music] we're going to need half a tablespoon of [Music] sugar [Music] i'm just pouring it into my mole and working as fast as i can this is hard candy so it hardens pretty quick and i'm just going to try and cover everything [Music] i wanted to mention this on my video because i know i'm going to get a lot of questions on it a lot of people say that these type of hearts tend to deflate or sink in what you could do in order to avoid that is multiply my recipe and fill your entire heart up [Music] and if you're using more candy than i am and it hardens on you you can always just go ahead and reheat it and it will be perfectly fine you will be able to reuse it [Music] so before i show you guys the heart i am going to show you how i'm going to decorate the box in case you guys want to use this for like selling decorating valentine's day is coming up i've seen boxes like these go for 30 40 50 just depending on the amount that you add so if you're looking for like an extra side business you can always do something like this and this is just to give you guys some ideas on what you can do so for this next step i'm taking just four strawberries i'm also going to be using some put parindo and then some lucas candy that are watermelon flavor as well and for each strawberry i'm just going to be using two of these packages and we're also using tahini i'm gonna take a little bit of water and just add that to the plate it's easier to remove these from the packet without gloves so i am just going to do that really quick i'm just going to take my fingers and i'm going to just put them inside the water and that is more than enough and then i'm just going to wet the side [Music] and now i'm just gonna roll these and make them one [Music] and then you can always use a little bit more water if you feel like you need to i'm also putting a little bit of pressure towards the outside so we can make this a little bit longer so now i'm just taking my strawberry and my candy [Music] and then just cover this fold this inward don't worry if it's not perfect i'll show you how to fix that and then just take a little bit of water with your fingers once again and go ahead and rub your strawberry make it as smooth as you can this is the time to fix your shape and it should look something like this once your strawberry has your desired shape go ahead put some tahin and try to cover as much of the purple as you can and this is how our strawberry should look and then i'm just taking a cupcake liner and placing it in here i'm going to repeat the same steps for my next three strawberries for your pulparindo if you feel like you're struggling you can always overlap it put a little bit of water on both ends and it will probably make it easier [Music] now if your leaves get a little bit messy you can always just take a wet napkin and just wipe them down [Music] and they're good as new so to give my strawberries a little bit of an extra pop we're going to be using these heart shapes now for that i'm just taking a plate and adding a little bit of chamoy so if you never use these before it's really easy you just push it down as much as you can and i'm going to insert my heart on the side of my strawberries [Music] and then repeat the same steps for the rest to avoid these from sweating you can go ahead and refrigerate and add chamois later you can decide to leave your heart empty or fill it up with something and because this is a breakable heart i will be adding our lucas gusanos to the center of our heart now i suggest preparing the inside first because the warmth of your hand will melt it and i had to clip it really fast just so i can avoid this from sinking in and i'm going to be taking some of the candy that i used to make the heart as part of my decoration [Music] you can definitely use this idea as a side job and i really hope that you guys like it if you have any questions definitely let me know i love to help you guys in any way that i can and i'll see you guys in my next [Music] video you", "KgNFAUTlodA": "hello everyone and welcome to yazis world today I wanted to show you guys how I did these beauties in candy so very simple if you would like to go back in my former videos what the candy apple recipe is there I'm not going to take you guys through that step all over again because it's it's already there twice but you do want to make sure you have parchment paper or a silicone mat of course to sit the berries on after you want to start off I already rinsed off I rinse them off as soon as I buy them automatically because the kids like to go back and forth in them but I'm just gonna give you a little snippet of how you want to do that so you just want to take cool water and it doesn't have to be strong just a little sprinkle so get them clean and you just Pat them dry and then you stick your toothpick in the middle which is pet the berry dry just like that pretty easy I'm going to show you guys one more like I said I already did them I just go ahead and you just stick it first I hope you want to just see it house it could be secure and dry the berries excuse my backup noise my noise in the background yeah that's my friend the person I'm making these for so yeah you just go ahead and do that now I do these with people like they gotta be like ten minutes down the street or like chillin at your house because they don't last long because once you dip the strawberry into the candy by their seeds being outside that's our strawberry seeds are it gets really moist and the candy starts to break down so like I said you weren't sure but very very sorry lightly and pat them dry get your toothpick you can put it in before or after stick it in the middle and that's how you clean your berries before dipping them so stay tuned for this video and we'll get started on the dipping process okay so the concoction of the water sugar and karo syrup is boiling it's almost it's almost ready remember we're going for a hard crack stage that's where it's going to get that candy effect on whatever fruit that you might be using we want that hard rock stage candy so right now it's at about 250 degrees we want to go ahead and let it get to heart Rock which is 350 degrees so I'm gonna let that finish off I've added my just a little bit of strawberry flavoring just to enhance the taste of it in general of the very I also have all my strawberries cleanse or cleaned rinsed and the toothpicks in the middle of them so that I can just hold the leaf and dip them in and set them and then when we're setting them on a styrofoam that I mean a silicon mat sorry or wax paper or parts of it paper whatever you have whatever works for you so I'm going to let this finish off doing what it needs to do just make sure you have your strawberries on deck in the toothpicks in them so you can dip and have control of the berry and you'll be good to go so I'll come back to you guys when it's time to dip our berries alrighty guys so I've taken my sugar concoction sugar Keira syrup and water concoction off that stones and this is how it's looking it's still bubbling and stuff so I'm gonna sit it place it right there go ahead and remove this from it let this cool off you don't just want to automatically rinse it off because um it will break it has happened to me so I just set it to the side I'm gonna let this cool a little bit just a little bit set it on my Mac and I'm just gonna get dipping so you're gonna take your berry and I tend to pull the Leafs back you want to be very careful because like I always tell you guys if you don't feel comfortable doing it barehanded you are more than welcome to wear gloves because this concoction is very very hot so I'm gonna go ahead and just dip the strawberry right in and pull it out and I will leave the candy recipe that I use below in my description box but I broke that that recipe down like three times just because I knew I was doing berries and I didn't need it doesn't call for a lot of the recipe so I like split it in half and then split that in half okay oh and that happens to the berry just follows in but I saved it as soon as you guys came with me there you go and you do it just like an apple like the extra slow and then you just say on your parchment paper or silicon mat do the same thing and like I said they don't last long if they're room temperature you've got about a good hour of life because the moisture from the berries will make the candy break down and we'll do a couple of more on camera and then I'm gonna dip the rest off-camera but hopefully you guys are getting the gist of how this works not too much different from dipping the apple or a mango or all those other great fruits but I think it's fairly simple and I'm also gonna do a video later on on how to do other fruits like a plum and a pear and a nectarine stuff like that because people do act and I know it might sound crazy but some people actually enjoy stuff like that okay so this is my last one on camera so we're pulling back the leaves like I said I know I said it before if you don't feel comfortable bare hand it wear gloves because the concoction is very hot and we're just dipping it in we twirl it however you want to do it oops already alright so I'm gonna finish dip and then come back to you guys when I'm finished so here's your finished product I remove the toothpicks when I'm finished they're good to go they're so pretty oh my goodness I haven't made these in forever they are so pretty it's so pretty yeah but that's the finished product so these are strawberries dipped in candy candied strawberries so I hope my quick video was informative for you

eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "218ztaU_ueU": "[Music] I'm a feeling like this really what's up guys I'm Ida and I'm Emily and together but we are

sponsored by magicalbutter.com use base drop keys to get 20 percent off your order on magicalbutter.com i want to thank them for sponsoring me in general but also sponsoring today's video 20 off magicalbutter.com all right guys so let's go ahead and get into it we're not wasting any time today without any further ado i bring you tongkulu here we go all right guys so we got our sugar inside of our saucepan we're putting the heat on low we're gonna go ahead and add our water in and we're adding in our honey for flavor and to help medicate this up if you want to see the full ingredient list and get all the directions and everything goodies420.com click the link that's in the description it'll take you over where you'll get the full recipe and ingredient list all right so what we're going to do is we're not going to stir that around we don't want that sugar to crystallize some people think that if you if you have the honey in there that it won't crystallize but i've still seen it happen before so we're going to be very careful with it so that the sugar don't crystallize and so we're going to we have this on the low temperature we're going to keep this at a low temperature until our sugar and the water and the honey and everything mixes well and the sugar dissolves once the sugar dissolves fully we'll go ahead and put it on medium and then we'll go from there so let's go ahead and give it a couple of minutes here and let's let this sugar fully dissolve on low all right guys so we're starting to get some action inside of the saucepan now we want all that sugar to start dissolving and then what we're going to do is we're going to put our thermometer in here and we're going to want this to hit 300 degrees fahrenheit or 150 celsius the hard crack it says hard crack on a thermometer that's what we wanted to to hit on a thermometer we're doing this without corn syrup a lot of the recipes use corn syrup we're not going to use corn syrup in ours all right so we basically got the sugar dissolved now and so basically we have it at a medium temperature and so we're going to cook this for about 8 to 10 minutes until it hits 300 degrees fahrenheit or 150 celsius right there where it says hard crack on the thermometer so yeah let's go ahead and do it all right guys so we hit the right temperature now we're going to go ahead and turn off turn the flame off and so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and add our one or two drops of red food coloring in [Music] we're going to add in our tincture [Music] stir it up here [Music] we go now we're going to go ahead and start coating [Music] our strawberries [Music] [Music] all right guys so i just showed you how to make tonkulu the great thing about this is you can make this with any

and welcome to lofty pursuits in\npublic displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida Greg is doing the narration and Jake is doing the subtitles. The candy I'm going to be making today is  sugar free Sour cherry. As I pour the hot candy onto the table let me tell you how unbelievably hot it is. This is hotter than sugar by 25 degrees F (4C). It does not seem like a lot , but ti is. \n The candy is been flavored with a natural cherry oil. Unlike most cherry candy, this does not taste like cough syrup. Also it is a great flavor for masking the flavor of the sugar free part of  the candy. I thought there would be two parts of The flavor to cover.The front of mouth taste, and that I covered with the cherry oil Then the back of mount flavor I thought I could cover mostly with a good sour. To do that I added this citric acid. It's trickier to add acid to isomalt because everything is hotter. And this citric acid while harder to add  gives this candy a crisp sour tart flavor just like you'd\nexpect from a sour cherry. Sour Cherry isan American tradition it's the most common cherry here in North America and it's known for being made into\ncherry pies and things like that but its history is ancient it was first discovered by Roman soldiers when they were on duty near the Black Sea. They  found this cherry\ngrowing in towns along the Black Sea and they brought it back\nto Rome and eventually the cherry was called the Montmorency cherry. It was  named\nafter a region of France even though it didn't come from that region in France. It was just the flavor I was going for and I'm happy how it came out. This candy is sugar-free, and as such it's not made of sugar it's\nmade of isomalt. Isomalt is a substitute a type of sugar alcohol and is a sugar substitue used primarily for its sugar like properties it has little or no impact on\nblood sugar levels and it does not stimulate the release of insulin so\npeople who aren't supposed to eat high levels of sugar this candy is good for\nisomalt is also about 1/2 the sweetness of sugar so to tweak the sweetness up a\nbit to match what we expect a hard candy to taste like we had a little bit of\nsucralose and we don't need to add much sucralose because sucralose is between\n300 and 1000 times as sweet as sugar. Since I only needed a tiny amount I used a very accurate scientific scale to get the proportions rights. So we build on the sweetness of the isomalt with the sucralose and we count on the isomalt to behave like what you expect hard candy to behave like. Neither of these mate rials promote tooth decay or effects insulin levels. I heard from so many of you that you wanted to try our candy by could not. iI's a little different to work\nwith than regular sugar it's a lot hotter when I pour it and it also sort\nof behaves more like plastic than clay so I have to get the temperature just\nright now that it's adjusted we're gonna cut off pieces and we're gonna feed it\nthrough our drop roller this little machine was made in the late 1870s and\nthis particular machine was owned by the A Cincinnati candy company. Greg\nwas able to acquire this piece of equipment because of a Kickstarter\ncampaign we did and you our fans allowed us to get it.  I want to thank all of you\nfor the support you've given us over the years this has been an amazing to get to do what we love, and have a lot of fun.

channel would like to see more recipes please like subscribe and don't forget to click the notification button [Music] I'm specifically highlighting Loran oils because I tend to get the most compliments when I use their flavors it's very important to set everything up in advance on the stovetop I keep a cup with warm or hot water to keep my brush in and it'll be where I place my thermometer when I remove it you'll need a brush or a tool to remove sugar crystals from your pot we purchase these cute silicone bear molds which will provide a link to in the description however if you don't have a mold you can use a small lightly oiled sheet pan for your candy on medium heat add your sugar corn syrup and water and stir until it comes to a small boil [Music] periodically you want to take your brush and remove the crystals that form around your pot now that your mixture is boiling stop stirring but continue to brush the sugar crystals that form around your pot your candy will be ready when it reaches the hard crack line on your candy thermometer as you get closer to 300 you want to make sure that your oil and food coloring if you're using it are ready because once you reach hard crack stage your candy mixture becomes time sensitive now that your mixture is reached hard crack stage remove your thermometer add your food coloring if you're using it and your one dream of Lorien oils stirring continuously some oils because they're super strength have strong scents so be sure to keep your oven or your stove fan on after you remove your mixture from the heat quickly but carefully because it's very hot transfer into your molds or onto a sheet pan my husband isn't a professional videographer and I'm not a professional candy maker so this shot is a little shaky and a little sloppy however this little tool I'm using is perfect to fix my mistake so we'll be sure to add a link to this silicone spatula below whether using molds or a sheet pan let your candy cool completely before removing once your candy is cooled if you're using a sheet pan gently break your candy into bite-sized pieces and you can also sift powdered sugar over them I personally prefer molds because they don't have as many sharp edges and as you can see even with arthritic hands they easily pop out [Music] sometimes I accidentally have fill some of the molds and we end up with a bowl full of accidents which my husband is happy to dispose of there are many recipes for hard candy as you can see I have a variation including rock candy but for more candy ideas we'll put a link to Lauren's website in the description this is a great homemade gift for any occasion or any season please share your candy ideas with me in the comments below and maybe I'll make them in a future video if you

Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and this is a drop roller a machine that makes drops that was made in 1871 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania we're gonna use this machine today to make some hard candy and the hard candy is a bit of an experiment in color and flavor this is about the fourth batch of the day and this is what I like to make experimental candy because the machine while it's a little stained with food coloring from the previous batches is also just right for making candy easily there is an old saying that you taste food with your eyes long before you taste it with your mouth the sight of a food or a color triggers a response which brings on the flavor and leads you to expectations and this video is about those expectations and expectations also take place culturally as we've discussed in other videos the United States sees purple as the flavor of the grape specifically the concord grape and europe sees the purple flavor and candy as the flavor for black currant so now that my hot sugars are 310 degrees i pour it out on my candy cooling table and I ask what flavor is this I mean it's not clear it could be anything and that's what this video is kind of about wondering what the visuals which you can see on the other side of the internet are and how they compare to the flavors which are on my side of the video camera these associations are well known by the people who make food and prepare food for you walk down the aisles of any supermarket and you will see the tomato sauce mostly in red and something that has blueberry in it will have a splash of blue the color is there to key you to what you can't see and can't taste outside the packaging and you are tasting with your eyes and this is okay it's because it's the way we were programmed if you think about it we must have developed food skills before we even developed language skills as a people because if you didn't know when the food was ripe or when it was dangerous to eat you wouldn't be able to you know process the nutrients you made so when something feels soft and even versus lumpy or picky when something smells nice or something looks nice you have expectations and the expectations are programmed into us earlier this year with a laundry detergent tablet we can see these expectations going the wrong way and I think this is a video about breaking those expectations let me give you an example there's something called the strip effect you see you can't taste or smell the candy across the internet but you can see colors and words just fine so let's have some fun with them and then try to apply that to candy so let me demonstrate how you're programmed with colors now I'm going to display some colors on the screen and as I display them save the color out loud for instance we're starting with orange will then do red green yellow blue pink red orange and you'll see the speed is pretty consistent when you do this remember we're saying the colors we don't really care about the words but here the words and the colors will match I want you to read these out loud left-to-right the colors that these words are we'll get back to the Stroop effect in a few moments but we're gonna go play with the hot sugar now and it's cooled off to a great consistency it's sort of the consistency of silly putty or playdough we're gonna put it through these brass rollers that'll cool it off a little bit and make it keep its shape if you'll notice we're making lots of drop rolled round candy here and an opaque red and that opaque red is gonna be important in a moment so now to get at what I'm demonstrating when I show you this next card read out loud the colors not the words but the colors and see if the delay is a little longer than last time [Music] if you did this experiment correctly and just read the colors you'll find the delay going on between when you see it and when you can say it because your body's trying to say or your brain is trying to say the word that's printed not the color of the word and flavors are like this too if you try a flavor that is red and it's colored blue unless you've been trained to recognize that like we have with blue raspberry you're not gonna end up saying or tasting in this case the flavor and that's what our experiment today is we're making drops in bunches of flavors but they're all gonna be the same color and one of the meeting I told everybody what we're gonna do they looked at me and almost as once they said that's madness and I realized our flavor assortment now had a name and madness it is and we're going to pack these candies randomly mix together so you should get some of all the flavors but what flavors some of them are going to be normal do you expect black berry in pink or would you expect an apple in pink we might have butter we're looking at doing a salty flavor and a hot flavor with chili pepper in it and other flavors with this and the fun part is we're gonna be replacing flavors as we run out so we're never quite gonna know what's in the assortment but there's always gonna be six or seven flavors I'm gonna aim for a salty and a sweetness sour and some other things in here and you're gonna have to guess the flavors it's an assortment of fun and love it's sort of combining spin the bottle and Russian Roulette and will give you hints online as we put them up so pay attention when you order but they're gonna change and we're gonna throw some wild cards into because you know April first is coming up and we're gonna have some fun with this candy thanks for watching our video if you liked it you can

marijuana now the candy was unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you

strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last

barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "hkQQdyqYPdU": "Hi guys, I'm Missy Missy. Today we will make candied strawberry. In case you don't have common sense, use fresh and nice strawberries Wash them properly. Use the good ones. For the rotten ones, throw them to Pewdiepie (No offence, I actually like him :P) **DUDE PERFECT** Rinse it and thoroughly dry the strawberries with a kitchen towel. If there\u2019s water on the skin the sugar syrup won\u2019t stick to it. Remove the green leaves but don't cut off the stem. Otherwise it will be hard to be held by a stick.  I tried before and the strawberries kept falling down :( Don't look at the cute orange catty car! Insert sticks into the stem end of each strawberry. They should be held firmly. To make the syrup, we will need 2 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water. (sugar:water = 2:1) BTW do you like my measuring cup? Just bought it online during this lockdown period. Was a bit worried after the purchase as I discovered the shop has many bad comments in their facebook page... (1 cup of water) It arrived in good condition anyway so sort of lucky :) What are you doing during the lockdown? Bring it to boil in medium heat. Do not stir the mixture as it needs to reach the temperature The mixture will start out cloudy.Boil until the sugar are dissolved. It takes about 10 mins. So do some stretching and exercise unless you want to get fat. ^O^ Then you should see the sugar syrup is clear, all of the sugar is dissolved and you have simple syrup.Be careful as the syrup is getting real hot now Switch to low heat and boil for about 10 mins. After 10 mins the mixture should start turning light brown. Unless you have eyesight problems, you should    be able to recognise the change. It's easier to use a white spoon to check the colour Switch off the heat immediately otherwise the syrup will get burnt easily Drop a small spoonful of sugar syrup into a bowl of cold water.  If it is Al Denta, you will hear some funny sounds like this. That means the candy syrup has reached its hard-crack stage and ready for coating! At this stage, the syrup forms brittle threads that can be easily cracked and snapped. Be careful though as it can be real shape and hurt your beautiful hands. If not, boil the syrup for another few mins and try again until it reaches the hard-crack stage. Quickly & carefully dip the strawberries into the syrup & twist to make sure it\u2019s completely covered.  Let any excess syrup drip off . Just be VERY careful not to touch it by hands as the sugar syrup is REAL HOT. If you want them to look perfect all around, insert the sticks upright. Otherwise set the m on a piece of baking paper to cool and harden. It takes about 3-5 mins to harden. Enjoy them with 2 hrs. Strawberries contain a lot of moisture and will begin to soften and weep as they sit. Good candied strawberry would not stick on each other. When you hit them the candied shell will break. To wash the pan and utensils. Simply add some water into the pan and boil them. Remove the water after and they should be all clean. gu........gu........gu.......gu...... gulugulugulugulugulugulugulugulugulu The crunchy candy shell goes prefect with the fresh and juicy strawberry. It's literally heavenly. OMG...OMG...OMG... Hey guys, this is my first video & I have ZERO subscriber...From zero to hero. Subscribe my channel & I  will love you forever Xxxxxx or I'll have my dog bite you!", "9byEOvA8-0w": "hello everyone we are back yet again with another week's review it is time for a week's mini review where we help you make sense of your dispensary and in these mini reviews we take smaller size edibles this is a 200 milligram edible and review them in a smaller format than traditional instead of our 30 6120 I just come back with you guys at two hours later and let you know how we're feeling so today we are reviewing something that we have never reviewed before a new brand this is from mcclenney confections quality you can taste and feel we shall see as you said this is a 200 milligram edible handcrafted cannabis nougat and caramel dark Belgian chocolate and it's the dark sneakers I guess kind of like Snickers except dum sounding all-natural ingredients whatever that means 1 to 8 servings we're just gonna have one serving and it says at the top the portions of a portion of donations go to animal shelters in need which is great ok it's got kind of this fancy plastic packaging just sort of unique I've never seen packaging like this for an edible nicely sort of floral rounders just got this odd plastic packaging let's open it up see how difficult is this it's not so bad inside maybe the slightest slightest hint of marijuana smell but nothing that's gonna get you busted that's for sure more of a dark chocolate aroma as it says but let's go to try okay and it's pretty good you can see the nougat and caramel inside there wow that is pretty tasty it tastes kind of like a dark chocolate Snickers bar without peanuts it's good it's very good um I'm eating it refrigerated so it's a little cruel but I like it that way I could get it and suggest you try it that way so in terms of taste Wow those consumed excuse me this gets high marks for taste but the proof is in how high this is gonna give me this this family at 200 milligrams only cost me I believe seven bucks is pretty affordable but we will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching Leakes hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the dark sneakers chocolate bar from mcclenney confections I've really enjoyed it this bad boy only costs me six bucks maybe seven bucks can't remember exactly which but it's a hell of a value good tasting really enjoy the taste no discernible marijuana taste whatsoever I'm pretty quality chocolate I think and over two hours later I'm still feeling pretty stoned so if you see a dark sneakers at a dispensary near you go ahead and grab one you're not going to be disappointed thanks so much for watching wheats we'll check you guys out on the next review", "xbg8gGtJoSY": "[Music] hey guys what's going on it's zach with top shelf so today i'm going to be reviewing the keefe life h2o kiwi strawberry it's a pretty interesting little drink they've uh they've got it down to calories down really really low it's down to 50 calories for the entire container or uh was that five to five calories per dose so that's pretty crazy 1.3 total carbs for the entire bottle uh 1.2 grams of sugar these bottles come with these little serving caps and it's a little it's uh looks like two little over two of these is one dose says the bottle says 35 milligrams so i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna pour it over a little glass of ice the kids got me this for uh for christmas so i'm gonna go ahead and use this here i'm gonna pour it over a little glass of ice see what it looks like almost perfect so it's uh clear it doesn't really look like water like they say it is but let's give it a little taste very good very light tastes almost like a propel which is pretty cool so those are always good to drink so the whole bottle they claim to have 191 milligrams of thc per bottle which there's 10 servings per dose which makes each serving about 19 milligrams um zero cbd cbda there is four milligrams of cbd in though which is pretty cool so they're starting to get those up um cost for these roughly about 40 dollars a bottle give or take depending on the dispensary you go to and the taxes they have so it's really not bad it's a lot easier to drink than that root beer that's for sure but you know you could always add these take a you know your morning coffee i don't know if you like any fruit or whatever fruity flavor in your coffee but add this to your your coffee or your mixed drink or something like that you know you don't know you don't have to drink it straight like this but it isn't bad drinking like this [Music] either [Music] so there it is so we'll let you know how it is here in a few minutes so in the meantime while we sit and hang out wait and see how it feels i'm gonna edit some videos for the next show [Music] yeah so i was reading checking some stuff out guys and i found out some interesting stuff about keith so uh last year they sold over a million products last year um it's pretty cool you know to to hear that a cannabis company is selling a million a million products in a year um their uh their first product was a uh like a five hour energy style a healthy five hour energy style um shot that was uh kind of like a full keefe drink but it was just in a shot so would have been uh that would be pretty cool if we can get something like that in the market in the future um you know they uh they're actually working right now with a former blue moon brewer to make a non-alcoholic thc beer so once i get the recipe and everything on that down that might be something that might be interesting to try you know i don't know if it's going gonna be a regular thing i can't imagine a cannabis beer uh beer is an acquired taste so i have a feeling that would be a uh extra acquired taste but you know that's something that they're working on you know my who knows it might hit the missouri market one day um some other cool stuff i found out was the uh the reason or so smoking cannabis you absorb the most cannabinoids than any other method of absorb of consuming cannabis um that's including thc the reason why some people will take an edible a small dose edible and feel it a lot more is you might absorb more of that thc but that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to metabolize it the same way when you're using edibles you're metabolizing that thc a lot differently it's going through your liver and it's running through your body a lot different than as if you're inhaling through your lungs so that's why some people will have those quite a bit different experiences on edibles um for me you know it's uh my towel like i've brought up in the last one my tolerance is pretty high i drink the uh the entire 200 milligrams um and all i'm feeling it um you know it's a pretty it's a it is a little uplifting energetic you know i kind of feel like doing stuff i've been sitting here editing videos stuff for our next show so it's a it's kind of energetic but at the same time i'm relaxed i'm feeling good you know i'm not ready to pass out at least yet you know i'm about an hour and so it's a it is very it's a very good drink i think would be a good drink during the day you know it's not a put you to bed kind of drink or anything like that even though i'm sure i'm gonna sleep good tonight but we shall see maybe i'll add a little bit of that to the end so i've been working pretty good today helping mix up the dirt the dank and working on the on the house we're putting in some floating hardwood floors taking that drink i was actually really surprised how how much it took the pain away you know with smoking it usually does help a lot but it doesn't usually completely take it away and right now i'm feeling fine helping my knee pain and everything my shoulder pain i'll give it that it did take the full bottle for me so you know for me one dose is a full bottle and 40 bucks a bottle it's a little much but if you're if one or two doses for you is all you need you know it's a little more cost effective but it's still you know it's better than flower prices but it is still up there so they still need to work on that um flavor-wise it's it's on point i thought it would taste pretty good obviously you can tell by my eyes i'm definitely feeling it morning number two it was pretty it was all right you know i slept pretty good kind of woke up with a little bit of a uh edible hangover i guess you could say a little bit of a headache um but other than that it was pretty it was all right you know i'd give the whole drink uh let's say a six out of ten um it was decent price was a little high but drink itself was pretty decent um i felt it um taste give about a nine out of ten taste was right on point uh let's see the effects keith root beer that i did a couple weeks ago i actually felt more off of so the the fact that this was a double the thc and i didn't feel quite as much it's kind of kind of let me down so i'll rate that one at six um obviously the health wise it's very very low sugar all that stuff so we got to give that like a nine compared to them root beers with 31 grams of sugar i mean if you're gonna get a drink and you want to stay healthy definitely get one of those kind of drinks so all right you guys take it easy stay lifted [Music] you", "WHkCVQ4q1EM": "this is our one cup of organic sugar and there's a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of cup of and turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "dLHNu8KKU8A": "hey everyone welcome back to the awesomer channel today we'll be making more candied fruits last time we use strawberries and blackberries today we'll be using mini green apples

videos see up [Music] you [Music]", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "HmClCY2OJS0": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary and I thought today since I have to go to the hospital later in the week that we can make a nice edible to take with me I've decided for this edible on using a Cresco RSO a nice sativa blend you know can't go wrong has some cbgc BC THC so what's next what do we do with it after trying lots of different ways to try to make different edibles and doing baking I really wanted to make some hard candies I don't want to get a candy thermometer I don't want to boil sugar and corn syrup so I found something about melting down Jolly Ranchers and then just pouring them into a mold and doesn't that kind of sound fantastic if it works hooey you already kind of know it works as I showed you so you want to see how we did it we just bought Samara so and I have a ton of Jolly Ranchers 22 and we're gonna try to make some melted down Jolly Ranchers and add the RSO and these levels this is gonna be real time-consuming taking them all apart separating them crushing them up and then hopefully make it easier to melt the fam well it's we're gonna use strawberry and pineapple watch this like now let's crush it up [Music] so we're probably going to double triple quadruple bag these ranchers before we smash it off with a hammer [Music] I don't have any three years of thanks are being so quiet she's terrible [Music] empty out we're emptying the contents of the crushed-up Jolly Ranchers into a pot and we're gonna put out on the stove yeah she looks all innocent this girl's been Barkin the whole time I'm gonna make sure some little butter in there just to give the heart so something to stick to so look a little sour - hey Zeus all this butter over here jacked up with candy on it just keep stirring just keep stirring [Music] it's kind of the consistency of like previously chewed bubblegum yeah accurate it looks like that too yeah it's five minutes away from giving in and becoming a liquid and you how long do you think we've been like stirring this on low oh my gosh at least 10 15 minutes okay not there yet it wasn't really doing much so we turn the heat up just a little bit it's like number two or three right in between there like a little past three but now it's really starting to melt down and I think we're almost ready to squeeze the RSO in there we have to heat up a tower so a little bit we're gonna fit the RSO in there for a couple minutes let it soften up so it doesn't break that click container so and we're gonna squeeze about half of this into that mixture if you could only smell this right now remember it was pink mmm no it's dank I'm gonna just pour it into the mold but it's to meet you hard to film that so I'll show you the aftermath here's the aftermath the pan came pretty clean only burned a couple fingers definitely a whole bunch of edibles I'm working on cheeping my own it's a little edible to be [Music] yeah I was just told that people don't keep confectioners sugar in the fridge comment below and know where do you keep it [Music] yellow like it was definitely worth making him this way but it seems like definitely a team effort yeah if I was alone I would have been really stressed out there's a audibles calculator online if you go to how to add a bowls calm and you type in the amount of product you use and the amount of THC that's in that product so you can use or so you can use distillates you can use your own can of butter and it tells you how much each of your edibles is when you divide it by the amount of edibles you make out of it so I'm not a math person it makes me real stress to even think about it the how-to edibles calculator is a lightsaber doing the math on our half gram of our so that we added and and we made oh I forget how many pieces but we had done the math the other day so the larger pieces that we made around 14 to 15 milligrams and the smaller heart pieces that we made were around 7 so I'm not mad at it I tried on the other day it was good it didn't last as long as people claim that their edibles last but if I get a couple hours of relief it's worth it for me and you know just keep eating them like you would a gummy bear so it's nice to have like a hard sucker so medical Mary approved", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that

title it is another delta 8 thc video this time we have some gummies and i also have a cartridge so we're going to be using both in here and he's never tried delta 8 before so if you don't know what delta 8 is what we usually smoke is delta 9 thc so this is a new thing that they have it's delta 8 which is another cannabinoid that people have been you know it's been picking up a lot of steam now you know kind of like when cbd came out you know people are just like well you can get this legally anywhere in the united states it's just like cbd but i won't provide any links anywhere like on the uh description because i've been deleted over cbd before so just trying to be careful but it is 300 milligrams of gummies uh our thc eight in this in these gummies and we're gonna go half on it and we're gonna see how it hits and then we're gonna be hidden on some of this gorilla glue hybrid which is ninety percent delta eight thc with 10 terps i do like to mention is that i did try the other disposable one and delta 8 does not taste like delta 9 in any way it tastes a little bit different um but mostly i just tasted the terpenes but there is a bitterness towards the end like toward like a medicine taste but you know that delta a delta yeah it just came out didn't just come out but it's been around but people haven't really been talking about it as it is now can you um just hold these for a thumbnail or something oh over here so i could i don't have to see your knee all right now open the gummies so like i said ladies and gentlemen oh yeah they even have nutritional facts on this [ __ ] i'm like damn brother you know qr code as well and you know no no you know yeah so open it and that's uh let's see what pour some in your hand actually for uh for like a thumbnail and just a few and then put the the thing so i could read the the thing you know all right yeah okay got it yeah all right so back on this camera we are gonna eat uh so there's 10 gummies each i think um so you already have two in your hand no don't drop the sugar what is this [ __ ] thc eight okay so he has five they actually have uh nine in here uh i would say maybe yeah because i i've already tried this my tolerance is a bit higher so you still have 1200 i mean you want to split on this one no that's knocking this is perfect okay all right i need to be able to function later still you guys well we don't uh so i've been told that thc 8 or delta 8 thc is a bit more mild not as intense and psychoactive as cannabis but then again we're eating it and eating thc is different than smoking or vaping so different feeling so yeah cheers it's got some chew on it that's not saying not bad this is good candy okay candy wise that's pretty far there's a car just like hello you know what i did i did think that maybe they would have had more flavors just because the the packaging was all rainbow two players or so yeah these two i wonder if there's thc in the circle sugar crystals oh it smells like a berry yeah whoa i think i ate one you just look all the salt or so what we're going to do guys because i know our tolerance or edibles don't seem to hit till like 20 20 minutes or so later not not too long i mean it doesn't hit too quick we're going to be hitting on this and then we're going to stop the video and then we're going to um i guess turn that back the camera on and tell us or tell you how we feel you know i'm saying if we do even feel anything resume the video as soon as this is done but yeah it came with the same package this came with the same uh oh yeah same person oh okay all right open up handcrafted boys [Music] there is a bit like a slight bit minimal bitterness towards the end with that candy but un barely noticeable i didn't really notice it too much that's why i said barely he said too much and barely noticed it too much see all right maybe you do i guess i'm just kidding all right um yeah we're ripping this way go ahead we're going in wow oh by the way we're outside randy's house so don't trip we're just oh [ __ ] very thin pinkish heel looking oil this would look like if it's vape oil yeah i see maple like this all right so uh i did mention in my first delta eight video that interesting uh i did mention that when i first heard of pink oil i was like what the [ __ ] but you know apparently it's uh delta eight when it's uh it shows or it's delta a that makes it pink or sometimes so i don't know i'm not a scientist in any way so they're not are they all different you think pretty sure right what do you mean like as far as the color i don't know i think they're the same throughout the day so we're going to be using the shiv you guys know the shiv right off the bat i this is it seems like a pretty nice cartridge itself probably going to lower it to let's do a 2.6 and as usual we're gonna let now he said in case it's poison i'll do it first i guess that's right so that way i get poison next that makes total sense you should let me go down see that i get poison and then you'll be like oh okay i'm not going to hit it now all right or it doesn't even hit oh yeah delta eight sorry buddy you want to try again check atomizer damn thing's pretty smart it tells you like what possibly could be wrong with it yeah that's pretty cool all right so apparently this is not compatible with this um i don't have another battery in here but i'll probably do an individual video on this but we still did take the thc so uh we're going to wait and see what's going on um do you have a battery i think i do unless you can get do you have a battery in here let me go check that's all i was thinking or now i think i do have one it just might not be good [ __ ] it it's probably better one that doesn't work right that's true i'll be right back throw this away we'll be back see he's we're really outside his house put this inside i'm feeling the delta oh the friendly farm that don't work yeah i think yeah i think it's that one that's gonna work all right let's see you guys it's just auto hit oh it's dead [ __ ] i have a charge in my car maybe we can [Applause] oh you got in the mail yeah my brother orders it i think you can't hit it like that i think i tried it before hey what's up oh [ __ ] that was your brother oh no it's all good so it has like a weird blinker time you have to like keep hitting it until like it actually turns on let me see try it it's probably because it's like oh yeah it's still blinking red still because it's gonna look kind of dead actually we're gonna get some time to charge guys yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right boys we back um he ended up being able to sneak a hit off this so let's just get another hit off of it um it's probably been about 10-15 minutes since we did take the the thc eight gummies so uh give it a few more minutes and we'll see but i planned on you know hitting this cartridge and uh hopefully boosting uh the [ __ ] feeling of the thca heat but yeah [Music] and so this is gorilla glue thc uh okay so it doesn't taste like medicine though don't taste bad you'll feel it and when you feel it just don't stop hitting it until it blinks but uh the similar bitterness towards the end but not bad like not much pretty much like a sprite like a lemon when you're trying it honestly it tastes like [ __ ] those medicine gummies that you eat the vitamin the vitamin ones yeah it tastes like that the flintstones don't taste bad yeah you know they're they're bearable at the end of the day this is people consider you know you know uh marijuana medicine you know what i'm saying so what's to say if it tastes like medicine a little bit you know it might be more willing to try it maybe the taste of delta 8 thc is that medicine taste because i've never tasted this coming from a distillate and you're gonna be like like thc nice little taste of like lemony yeah yeah like uh like a sprite like a sprite yeah that's a good one very similar to the other jack carrera one i do like to mention that uh gorilla glue is a sativa hybrid and jeff herrera is also a sativa so that's probably why they have similar terpenes or at least like a piney lemony you know so does this hit the same like amount of thc as the other one or delta nine or something i don't even know there's different deltas you could have like delta one through nine and [ __ ] now so uh i've heard from people i don't know if this is true or not i've read it i've seen people tell me that you know uh people use delta eight to lower their tolerance on delta nine because the tolerance of delta eight does not uh is not the tolerance with delta nine but i've heard that it isn't i've heard that uh delta eight is more of a like a more mild high it's not really too much as thc you know thc or delta nine thc [ __ ] getting confused but yeah um i'm a little confused on that too but i can see like so delta a is just basically it's a new cannabinoid that's not new but it's barely getting studied right now and it's barely picking up steam just like cbd did like two years ago um people are like a lot of uh street carts or fake cartridges that are uh probably pink or this pinkish hue it's probably delta eight you know since it's legal you can buy it and then probably street dealers are probably putting it in their cartridges i don't know um but me using this one is not bad you know i believe it's 25 for a gram out the door and for people that are in illegal states that don't have access to you know uh legal cannabis products you know this is a better uh not better alternative this is an alternative wait so they uh you can buy this legally and like in the clubs right now oh i have actually seen delta a products in authentic oh sure okay yeah but you can buy this online on websites there's a lot of companies three chai shout out to naruto i believe there's another one i forgot another one he mentioned but you know uh i'm in a place where i'm fortunate enough to have companies uh message me i don't really message too many companies anymore but uh when they do message me and then they uh i check out their website and it's cool seems legit you know i will consider it you know what i'm saying yeah it doesn't taste bad at all it doesn't it's funny it does taste like sprite hey [ __ ] a lot of people like sprite you know what i'm saying dude sprite's like one of the only few sodas that i want yeah because it doesn't dye your teeth sprites [ __ ] the [ __ ] sprite so after taking a few hits off this and the gummies do you feel some some type of i feel that change i feel mellow yeah i was honestly gonna say that too like i'm not like like i'm not stupid faded you know like you would get from dabs and stuff and like real delta and 98c but i feel like just like in the first video i felt something it was definitely different than a normal high yeah like i don't feel like um i feel relaxed i feel relaxed mellowed out i don't feel like let's say if i was to like smoke a dab i'd take too much of a big dab sometimes i get paranoid i don't feel like i'm gonna get paranoid or not my mind and everything is like i'm relaxed i feel it this is refreshing because it is like a sprite you know what i'm saying and uh like off that first do a blinker do a finger and see what's up but lightweight low key i kind of feel like the edibles are starting to hit but then again it could just be you know i'm feeling this but i'm feeling because when you obviously like i mentioned earlier when you eat something it's much different than smoking or when you're eating cannabis it's much different than smoking it we're vaping it but i definitely feel it in my eyes oh yeah look at you see my new merch got the the wax right here oh [ __ ] evolution you took that photo yeah no i got it off a website that's royalty free picks so you know what i'm saying once you put it on there anyone could use it unsplash.com i think it's dead again i think we got enough hits out of it i would say uh but like i said man i am definitely feeling something different than a normal high that you would get off delta nine thc ugh oh i did just eat habit and maybe you know smoking after you're eating you don't feel it i don't [ __ ] know i'm trying to [ __ ] say something uh how are you feeling and i definitely feel high though no joke just just not like a normal high it's not a weird battery yeah it's not the best battery but it happens we made it happen yeah my eyes it matters so you know your opinion i give it i'll give it a go give it a good grade you know like i would i don't know like if i didn't i mean i didn't know about it now that i know about it and i see it around oh yeah yeah i might be like more interested on this channel too no i will say that now that i know about it from like you exposing it to me i might like if i go to the street i mean to the clubs and see it i might be more interested in buying it now because now i had an experience with it and i know it was good so i might be more interested and when i see it in the store to go and pick it up so i do say it was good yeah i like it are you would you say you're pretty i would say i'm pretty highly look at me you gotta talk and prove it oh yeah no for reals i usually usually stump i usually be stuttering looking [ __ ] like a number you're hitting pretty good and i'm proud of that y'all know me i'll be stuttering yeah so uh like i said uh earlier there's a lot of delta eight thc like companies out there so please just do your research uh this one's pretty good and i i would vouch for some other ones based on naruto's opinion because he's tried them uh but yeah just do your research and you know uh they this website that they have actually tells you like you know delta thc uh delta athc 101 has blogs articles on there so if you want to check that out and learn more on this website specifically i believe uh i'll post it in the comments post go and check it out yeah but uh let us know what you think in the comment section oh yeah and by the way subscribe to the homie you know i'm saying kind of ended with that but hopefully you did enjoy the video you got anything else to say to the lovely people of the internet i just want to say i hope you guys enjoy the video as well and we'll see you guys on the next one man hey peace out [Music] oh", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before stay tuned for this great recipe thanks for watching", "wj_mt_TxbDY": "hello hello and welcome back to the channel today we're going to do some strawberry nugs and if you're not familiar with strawberry nugs they are the strawberries that look like they are covered with marijuana okay these are going to be the items you need to make them i have some oreo vanilla thins you're going to need your chocolate you're also going to need some gel food coloring which is green and purple you're gonna need two sandwich bags and you're gonna need your strawberries okay so we are going to get started [Music] [Music] okay so here we are going to take our oreos and divide them in separate bags [Applause] okay so here i'm just going to add a couple of drops of green into my oreos and we're going to mix it together until they are fully coated okay so now we're going to take our other bag and we're going to add a couple of drops of purple and we are going to mix it into our [Music] oreos okay so now what we're going to do is take our colors and we're going to mix them together [Music] do okay so there's my cookie mixture i have melted down my chocolate and at this point if you want to add any oils to your chocolate you can do that so what we're going to do is take our first strawberry we're going to dip and try to completely cover we're going to shake off some excess we're not going to scrape it on the bottom because we want it completely coated okay i'm gonna bring it up i'm gonna take my mixture and i'm going to coat my berries okay [Music] okay i'm just gonna sit her down a dress and make sure you try to get your colors combined fully okay so we're going to take another strawberry we're going to pull back the leaves we're going to dip and completely coat we're going to shake off excess okay and we want to shake up as much excess chocolate as possible so it does not drip and you have a perfect coated berry okay so we're just gonna shake shake shake taking a handful is better than coating your berries for me it's up to you how you do it if you have a way that works better for you use your method okay and we're just coding completely okay all right sit it to the side i'm gonna do another one i'm gonna pull the leaves back we are going to dip and completely coat now we're going to shake off as much excess as possible [Music] so if you would like to add any oils to your chocolate to infuse it that's up to you but this is how you're going to get the look for your berries and you can also add in some of your regular cookies that have not been colored that gives it an awesome look as well okay so we're just coating and trying to completely coat our berries okay so that's how you're gonna get that look okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "UcwnDM7PlOc": "welcome back you two so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make chocolate covered strawberry nug so basically they look like we nugs but you would need is golden Oreos white chocolate food coloring I'm using green and purple three plastic bags and then some strawberries so with three plastic bags what you guys are going to do now is put some golden Oreos inside so after separating the golden Oreos what you would want to do now is put them in the blender the reason I put them in the blender is because you get a finer texture after it's done and I will show you guys in just a moment [Music] so after you're done blending your cookies what you're gonna want to do is grab your food coloring so you're gonna grab purple food coloring and you're gonna grab green food coloring so put the green food coloring it just gives it a more of a color of how the weed looks like and then with so purple I'm going to obviously color the cookies purple and then with that I'm gonna mix it inside with the green so it gives it more of a realistic look [Music] so after the food coloring is mixed into the cookies it's going to look like this and I'm going to show you guys how and you see how fine it is like it looks very very fine and then it looks very green so you would want to get it that color [Music] so basically it's the same thing as the green color once you're done mixing in the purple it should be looking like this if you can get a darker then that's great but if you can't then this is perfectly fine okay so this is when the third bag comes in what you're gonna do is put some of the green that you mix together into that bag and then start adding little by little of the purple inside bag so you're gonna mix it until you start seeing the purple inside the green and then at the end I'll show you how it's supposed to look like [Music] so once you're done mixing it together this is how it's supposed to look like I'm not sure if you could see the purple in side the camera but there is purple in there and then I'm gonna show you the difference between the green and between this back [Music] so this next steps pretty easy I have my strawberries they're washed in they're dried make sure you have white chocolate melted you're gonna grab some toothpicks put them on the strawberries dip them in the chocolate and then coat them with the toppings [Music] so after you're done coating them with the topping you're gonna set them in the fridge for about 10 to 15 minutes so that they can Harden this is a finished product this is the one with purple and green mixed together and then I'm gonna show you the one with just the green you see how realistic it looks [Music] you", "J-CQhL5uCwk": "Hey number of you have asked me how I go about making these candies that I post on to Facebook so I thought I would spend a little time here and make a video of me making the latest batch of candy I'm making a Japanese pinwheel design and the flavor in this particular batch is pomegranate that you see me adding to the hot sugar the sugar is about 310 degrees so it's pretty warm it will burn you severely if you're not careful so you gotta be cautious you'll see that I awesome now adding citric acid bring helps bring out the flavor in the candy you don't taste a lot if you don't have some kind of a acidic additive into the sugar now I'm pouring out what looks like four equal pools of sugar the point here is that I want to make four different colors I'm dividing it all up of course they're all have the same flavor in it because I entered it before this step and you're gonna see me go ahead and start to make the colors and I'm gonna use in this particular design this is red adding a little yellow a little blue for my primary colors a little white that's going to be used for it's sort of to reflect and help enhance the colors I'm gonna mix them all here and you'll see that it's boiling a little bit or steaming and the purpose of that is to try to drive off any water water and hard candy is quite the enemy and you're always trying to avoid adding any water or working in humid conditions it turns out this is a nice cold day today so it's a nice day for making candy I mix in the white now it turns out you don't really have to add white coloring if you use white if you just take that amber sugar and pull it long enough it will turn white as it incorporates a bunch of air bubbles it to alecky do with a taffy machine and now what you're seeing is I'm slowly peeling up the sugar is it cools on the edges and moving it into the center of each puddle if you will and that helps even out the temperature and eventually will make it easier for me to mix the colors in throughout each each grouping here you'll notice I've sped this up quite a bit and it's just an effort to make this video go a little faster all in all it's only about 10 minutes or so still pretty darn hot probably up in the mid 200s so it's I am wearing gloves under the blue gloves to help with the heat and you'll see me occasionally just set my hands on the table and that's just to try to help them cool off a bit they get pretty warm you'll see people often wear a really heavy gloves like welders gloves it's tough when it's this hot but I can work pretty quick here and then don't need it now I'm mixing the colors I'm not going to pull them too much I want them to maintain a transparent quality to them and you'll see at the end why that is but you can pull them quite a bit and actually in this case a red weed almost turned pink it would pull enough white into it from from the air bubbles that's incorporated from pulling you see the folks we've worked with a lot of white color they put them on essentially a taffy puller and help drive out or to drive it air bubbles and really generate a nice bright white crisp color in this particular case I mean it'd be that overall bright but I do want to be nice and opaque enough to help reflect the colors I'm gonna use in the design so it turns I don't want just three colors I want six colors and the nice thing about making the three primaries here is if you remember in art school or in high school in art class you can mix your primary colors to get just about any color you want so I'm dividing these into fourths because I'm actually gonna make six colors I guess I'm gonna cut them up here and if you remember of course that when you mix your red and yellow you get orange when you miss your red and blue you get purple and your blue and yellow to get your green and that's what I'm doing right here again I'm just trying to pull it enough to mix the colors evenly you know it's hard to see but in front of me there is a it's actually a pancake griddle I use as a heat plate and that helps slow the cooling down a little bit helps me control temperature the whole art of working with with hard candy is to maintain temperature gives to hot of course it melts you can't do anything with it if it gets too cold it gets brittle and you're done so we work to keep that sort of clay texture or state now I'm going to take each color and I'm gonna make essentially a long a triangle each one a there's going to be a wheel of the pinwheel and on each edge I'll put a little white and that will help divide the colors up when you when you look at the candy of all assembled so I'm gonna go through each color and do this I use this little spatula to helps me make a little nicer cleaner as you just edges almost there you see me occasionally rotate the sugar or in this case I may be taking it off the heat plate because it's getting a little too warm and I'm starting to lose the structure of the triangle and so I can take them off the hot plate and cool them down this way a little bit right now I've got my six triangles I'm gonna start putting together my pinwheel by adding each of the colors together I will give you my design as long as I'm working with them with their hot like this they'll stick together pretty well even if they cool off a little bit you can just run a little bit of water like on a damp cloth across the side of it and it'll act like glue and piece them together but I'm tending to work pretty quick so they're they're still pretty we're pretty good at hue so quality to them all right so now I've got my master role together here and so I'm moving away from maintaining temperature to maintaining structure of the design and I want to keep this round cylinder and first thing I got to do though is make them sort of bite-sized and that's what I'm doing now by stretching the the cylinder out a little bit and that design will be maintained whether it was letters or colors or shape or whatever throughout that whole structure or throughout all those little rods that are being pulled out they're also hot and if they sit too long and they'll go flat so you'll see me constantly rolling two cylinders to keep them from are the rods to keep them from going flat and maintaining their circular structure and that's what I'm doing now this takes a little while because it's going from a pretty warm temperature to you got to get them to they're essentially cooled down so you can crack them lifting it up shows you they're still not quite ready yet cuz they're uh they're deform now I'm getting ready if you kind of cut it out there but I did that for about 20 minutes off and on so now they've pulled down quite a bit I'm going through the process of breaking them into bite-sized pieces you can make these at different sizes I like this size it's about a half an inch and it's a nice bite-sized piece you can of course stretch the cylinders out or the rods out longer and thinner and you get smaller pieces or you can make different sizes whatever you what do you pretty like but this seems to work pretty well and that pot table you did admit of course it's sat for 20 minutes so it's actually cooled down now but I need that hard starch surface to cut against so the pieces essentially crack off and smaller pieces [Music] I'm getting them nearly finished as you might guess the rods that are in the middle of the thing looked the best some of the ones on the end or a little more deformed one way or the other but they all taste great and so he just tend to mix him in and nobody seems to carry to worry too much about it if it was something important I guess she could weed them out but the more careful you are the more uniform your structure is throughout the whole the whole sample set I'm getting to the end we'll cut the rest of these out and I'll let them cool a little bit longer roll them around little bit to kick get any sharp edges off and then I'll pack them up and hand to my friends and family and hopefully they enjoy them and it is a nice flavor and they do seem pretty pretty popular getting towards the end here here is the finished product as they lay it on the table but I really like a bottom though is when you hold them up to the light they really pop have a nice color to them in the light you know hold them up to the Sun or what have you oh that's about it I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a chance to get some of these they are good I hope you enjoy it let me know I know thanks bye", "M84tO1aDpxc": "[Music] help you guys make sense of your dispensary life here behind us is the beautiful mountains in I believe Nevada I think we're now out of Oregon we're just leaving the Eclipse out on this wonderful road trip and we're taking a break here at this rest stop exit and we're gonna be reviewing a nutbar our second product from nug bar they're just boring milk chocolate 200 milligrams we reviewed their 100 milligram last time I actually found it to be not that good I didn't get that high from it unfortunately but I've got a lot of high hopes for the 200 milligrams I'm gonna hope it's just more potent in general least twice as potent as the hundred milligram it is a much better value it only cost me 12 bucks of my dispensary and I got it even for a discount at that I believe I got it for 10 bucks to 10 dollars for a 200 milligram chocolate bar if it is in fact potent as advertised is a very very good deal but it actually has to be as potent as advertised for it to be a good deal so guys without further ado I'm gonna go and open her up I take a bite out of it and then I will be back in just a few minutes for you guys two hours for me to let you know how I feel oh we got some melted going on here lot of melted gotta be careful oh shoot so it's a little melty guys gonna be careful with it good chocolate barely melted see you guys in two hours thanks for watching [Music] it's been two hours for me since I had the nut bar and milk the chocolate I think that's when it's called I left the package in the trunk I can say I'm really disappointed with nutbar they're not very good their products taste pretty good the two I've had I liked quite a bit but it seems like they taste pretty good because they might be masking the fact that they have less cannabis than advertised which is a shame because they say that they are rated by a laboratory I don't know anything really about CW analytical which i think is who claimed to be their sort of laboratory we're doing buddy but I definitely don't feel like I hated 200 milligram edible even after having my mind [ __ ] blown by this Eclipse and I know I've been talking about this eclipse a lot but if you saw it you kind of understand why so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys and that's going to do it for the road trip series on meats as well I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "aB_7ybNekGU": "as you know I'm an old man I'm getting up there in years you sir there's a lot of gray up here and in here not quite 60 yep I'm close but it occurred to me the other day that there are a lot of things that I've never done before and and one of them was make candy so that changes today well hello there old man Kelly you're Jeff to my friends in Utah me Jeff um let me tell you something about myself I don't cook I don't even barbecue I know take my man card away this guy doesn't barbecue men are supposed to barbecue so in an effort to broaden my horizons I thought what's something I've never done before and that's meat candy now was thing I was thinking back to when I was a kid we used to have these these flat hard candies that were about I don't know four or five inches by an inch and I'm really thin they were covered with plastic and you peel the plastic off they were delicious there was a cinnamon one that I used to always get at our local well it was a pharmacy that right down the road that sold candy and I'd get him there and they thought you've got to be able to make those at home right so I went on the internet I found four or five maybe six people who showed how they make rock-hard candy and I thought I could do that so I took these recipes from different people and sort of combined them and everybody had their own slight different way of doing it though it's all pretty much the same thing and so right now I'm gonna go through how I made some cinnamon rock-hard candy you need sugar I use two cups of sugar for this recipe light corn syrup you're gonna need about two thirds cup about 3/4 cup water is necessary and the flavoring I'm using the cinnamon oil that my wife got from somewhere and doing the powdered sugar for the very end a few other things you might need is a candy thermometer and parchment paper don't use wax paper the wax might melt parchment paper is better okay in my saucepan first I'll add the corn syrup that very thick sticky corn syrup follow that by the sugar that's 2 cups sure and the water with a food coloring just for style turn on to a high heat initially you want a high heat to really get this boiling quick but you have to keep stirring till everything's dissolved you don't want to stop stirring because you don't want it to start burning to the bottom of the pan remember you're a high heat once you get it to a good boil then you're ready to turn down the temperature of Bin's come out to a medium heat and now we're gonna let it simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes and this point we want to use our candy thermometer and now the goal or what we have to do here is get this concoction up to about 300 degrees that's called the hard crack temperature or something like that it's just a little over 300 degrees you can see our temperature's rising quickly but reality this took almost 40 minutes to get to the right temperature and of course a little coffee while we're waiting and our temperature continues to climb to get that's hard crack temperature and I'm not sure if you're supposed to but I kept stirring because I was afraid it would stick and burn and all that stuff and it didn't seem to hurt it we're almost there you can see it hard crack has been reached [Music] okay so we immediately removed from heat we can take up the thermometer this is where we add our flavoring my cinnamon oil I'm gonna add the whole bottle to this and almost immediately the whole house is filled with that cinnamon flavor you can smell it everywhere and you've got to stir it quick because this stuff gets thick and hard next we'll take a baking sheet covered with our parchment paper and we're gonna dump it right on there this thick gooey mess don't get any on you kids have your parents do this that kids don't try this at all because this is very dangerous very hot sticky mess 300 degrees and is too bright to your skin and burn you pretty bad if you're not careful and that's it now we've got to wait for hours before we can break this up and put the powdered sugar on and so we're done it's been four hours since I poured the concoction onto my pan and the nice part is it'll peel right up now look at this it's almost like a clear piece of glass right every so this you should just break it into chunks and look at that broke up nice and now what they say you have to do is cover baking powder because it's still sticky and though I actually like it like that the candy and remember it wasn't covered in baking powder but that had that plastic the plastic over it so I'll cover it with baking powder baking powder add some sweetness so I don't think it needs it and it'll get rid of the stickiness right and so you end up with chunks and all different shapes and sizes and now [Music] pretty tasty does remind me of those fire sticks I you see it as a kid and cinnamon always goes well with coffee so [Music] but it does plastic containers save it for later thank you for watching I hope you appreciated this I tried something new today and I sure enjoyed doing this maybe I'll do candy again in the future find another handy recipe if you've got a candy recipe you think I should try it let me know let's see if we can do it otherwise this is jeff saying so long okay [Music]", "emlLrUtF4O8": "[Music] hey guys welcome back today I'm gonna show you how to make infused fruit roll-ups or fruit by the foot this recipe is very simple it only requires two ingredients here's what you're going to need sugar and between 1 and 2 cups fruit I'm using some very ripe mango that I have but you could use frozen fruit or fresh fruit the riper it is the sweeter it's going to be and I really like the texture of mango that'll be very smooth instead of due to something like strawberries but it'll be like a lot of seeds the editors you like will work the first step is to pre-heat your oven to the lowest temperature it will go for me that's 170 degrees now we're going to blend our ingredients together I have about 1/2 cups of mango here but you could use anywhere between 1 and 2 cups [Music] so - super ripe which is why it looks as goofy as it goes now you're going to want to add either lemon or lime juice I don't have either of those because I personally really like these true lines and true lemoned powdered lemon in line just because I try it takes more realistic to actual lemon on line than using those bottles of the ones that kind keeps better so you can add lemon juice or lime juice to this I'm going to be using powdered wine because I think it will go very well with a pickup so if you're using liquid just do like one or two tablespoons now I'm going to add my sugar you could also use honey and you could use infused honey or sugar I don't have any infused sugar I'm just going to be using regular sugar and there isn't a specific amount you need it all has comes down to how sweet to be and how sweet you're free is to start if you want it to be more like the type you buy from a store you're going to want to use more sugar because the main ingredient and the burliest sugar so I want my to be pretty sweet and if you want your confuse he's probably not quite a bit to get it nice and strong so what can I put a boat maybe like a quarter cup in there maybe a little bit less and then we're just gonna blend that all up now that it's all blended the next step will be to pour your mixture onto a baking sheet lined with either a silicone mat like I have or you could use parchment paper and then you can use a spatula or spoon to spread it out and then we're gonna put it into the oven for anywhere between two and six hours depending on how hot your oven is and I want half of them to be Tajin flavor to Mego alignment in so I'm going to sprinkle on some extra lime onto the side and then some [Music] so let's end up being in the oven for four and a half hours so it's all dried up and only a little tiny bit sticky you can see it peels right off the mat real easy so now I'm just going to cut it into some strips if you want it to be a fruit roll-up you could cut it like this way and then here and here it's there six but I want mine to be through roll-ups or fruit by the foot so I'm going to cut them this way [Music] while there is oven I cut some strips of parchment paper you can use wax paper parchment paper anything you like or if you cook them on parchment paper you can just cut them right on the paper okay guys I had a little bit of the crunchy pieces and now let's have some of the delicious chewy pieces also yes Ahmed gentlemen obviously a lot later now since these running out in the oven for four and a half hours if I would do it again I probably only do about four hours just because I felt like some of the pieces were a little bit crunchy now let's give it a try this is the one with the two mean on it it's really good like I'd really really really like this I hope you guys try this out because it's honestly amazing well thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys try this out please let me know if you do and if you enjoyed this video please give us a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks again guys bye [Music]", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies? check out our AsAP stop video that breaks down the science behind that by clicking the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday", "KbQ085Xw1rw": "Hello Everyone! Welcome to our Youtube Channel \u201cEveryday Life\u201d. Again we are here, with a new interesting information is on  how fruits are being preserved with Dehydration, Candied and Freeze dried processes.  Here, we have dehydrated strawberries, candied starawberries and freeze dried strawberries.  Here, we are demonstration entire food preservation technique with example of strawberry. Mostly all the fruits can be preserved with all three processes.  Even sometimes, vegetable too preserved with these processes.  These are just processes to preserve fruits and vegetables for longer duaration. Even fruits are also preserved for the demands of the recipe. First we have dehydrated strawberry. Dehydration is one of the oldest process. This process has been used for ages.  In this process, fruits are cut into pieces and then sun dried.  Initially sun dried method has been used. But, now big dehydrators and dryers are being used to dry moisture of the fruits. Just like this, in front for you, is dehydrated strawberry.  As moisture has been removed that is why this is turned into darker colour.  This process make them lighter than original weight. Dehydration is based on principle that fruits content moisture and removing that make them last long.  This has long shelf life. This can last upto 6 months to a year. This can be consumed as breakfast cereal, as it is, or use it to decorate cake or cookies. Second process is candied process in which fruits are cooked with sugar and then dried after removing excess sugar.  Then this is converted as candied form. This kind of candied fruit  (candied strawberry) is taken as candy. This is quite popular among children  because it has sweetness and sourness of fruits along with extra sweetness of sugar.  This is shorter shelf-life .  These should be consumed within 3-4 weeks.  This is also used in the baking of cake and cookies.  Candied fruits is also a old method for preserving the fruits similar to Indian Murabba. Third process is freeze dried process.  Here, this is freeze dried strawberry. There are small pieces of strawberry. This is one of the latest method to preserve the fruits. This increases the shelf life extensively.  This process can not be done at home. This needs specialised machine that eliminates the moisture of the fruit (Strawberry) with freezing.  This process consumes a lot of time. Even machine could take 24 hours to freeze dried the fruits. The freeze dried method reduces the weight, it becomes very light. Freeze dried method increases the shelf-life.  Some says you can even store freeze dried products upto 30 years.  This can also see them in high-end gourmet sugar.  Those sugar are made with this kind of freeze dried fruits. This freeze dried method eliminates the moisture content and makes the fruit very light. These freeze dried fruits are very expensive in the market. With almost no moisture it is very easy to grind such freeze dried fruits. The perfect example of these are inside the Cup of Noodles that has vegetables are in freeze dried form. And when you add boiling water it  regains its shape. In these 3 method of preserving fruits- Dehydrated, Candied and Freeze Dried. Freeze dried method is the healthiest method. Because this contents all its natural flavour and nutrients  of the fruit.  This doesn\u2019t have any additional sugar and no moisture at all. Candied method has additional sugar as it has been preserved in sugar. Hence, often health-conscious people tend to avoid it. Dehydrated also has little more sugar content as it becomes concentrated form of sugar due to this process.   The process reduces water content keeping fibre and nutrients, but also increases concentration of sugar content.  These all three are easily available in the market. Dehydrated fruits are easily available in the grocery stores. Candied fruits are easily available at the confectionery stores. These freeze dried is available in the high-end departmental stores and online stores. Today we have shared the information that when fresh strawberry is not available in the market .  Then you can enjoy strawberry in its dehydrated, candied and freeze dried form throughout the year. And we hope our today\u2019s information will be useful in your Everyday Life. Thanks for watching and keep exploring your Everyday Life.", "g4tHSckLfGk": "[Music] [Music] only thing i care about is living life the best i could only want to smoke and stay productive till the day

the Northeast you do have to be careful though because there are fake versions of this this is lemonade wild cherry they also have the red which is you know the normal nerds colors and then they have a purple and they have a pink but there is no blue if you see a blue it is fake and stay away cuz there's been stories of these being laced with various other drugs so make sure you're getting them from a reputable source and make sure you really trust who you're going to but if we just get started take a look tear and share No thank you I'll keep it for myself point 9 ounces I don't know I don't know what that matters to you this is the lemonade wild cherry if you have the option of flavors I would I just love lemonade so like you know I obviously picked this one but this is by far my favorite flavor add all of them super potent formula I would honestly have to agree with them 400 milligrams per rope so I won't lie I'm a lightweight when it comes to edibles I smoke flower everyday I smoke concentrates most days but edibles just do me very dirt they really just [ __ ] me over so thoughtful portion 1/8 of the rope will be 50 milligrams so you know you can extrapolate that to however edibles match your body those are the ingredients in case you would like to know some more nutrition facts and this I did another nerd rope edible review and that one was a lot more thick and not you know like more homemade this they've they tried very hard to recreate the exact like texturing and everything the other one who's a lot softer and more gelatinous than a real nerds rope this one's a bit more hard and a bit firmer than a normal rope but these these really kick lands I gotta say hey this much about say about thirty minutes ago 60 minute activation time as I said I'm kind of a lightweight when it comes to edibles so I'm already folded and I've gone to other edibles and eaten them and you know how to like felt it obviously but these for some reason I love like these just get me in such a good mood and they give me like folded like where it's like a body high you know one thing that why is he covered in blood I'm assuming it's supposed to be the you know the rope part but this just looks kind of scary like are you okay man looks like you're stomping in someone's guts and he's very happy about it if you like Evan if you like edibles if you like karts you like you

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "oJKnXFcpcUI": "tis I miss cannabis puree with more reviews for you today and today I've got these sublime products here elevated cannabis is a 10 milligram THC we've got this little sorrento cucumber cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom sublime products I love sublime products I've talked about them numerous times again the reason being is that they're really consistent these are no different than anything else and they are low dosage again 10 milligrams can you see it there 10 milligram THC I've already taken this because I already know what they do again they're so consistent that it doesn't matter from batch to batch they're always the same and what I think is important to discuss here is how they work and why they work for me and then maybe you can decide how they're going to work for you and if they'll work for you I take these as a preemptive strike these little goodies never make me feel high I never get that I'm high from THC feeling what I do feel is a ease of anxiety so when I know I'm gonna be in a stressful situation I take these beforehand for instance I ride my bike a lot there's a lot of places out here or there is no bike lane you know people just don't care either you do not get that three feet that they are supposed to allow between you and their vehicle they don't care there's none of that so a lot of times there is no bike lane I've got like this you know what's supposed to be the shoulder but it's just kind of where the asphalt kind of trails off into gravel and that little area I have to write it as usually filled with debris and rocks and things that I have to avoid so while I look as cool as a cucumber while I seem to not be worried about anything if you were to look at my hand you would see that I would just Knight white-knuckling it you know I'm just gripping so hard but these help a lot with the anxiety and it's why I look as cool as a cucumber because these help with a lot with that I usually would take them excuse me like maybe an hour and have two hours before I knew I was gonna be in the situation and they just smooth out that edge so I'm not in a situation where I go from anxiety panic attack it is very scary riding your bike on the side of the road because people are insane anyone who rides their bike knows this and you don't have to have PTSD to have that anxiety so if you you know bright a lot like I do I'm not gonna allow my fear to stop me from living my life so these candy has helped so much with that all right so I'm done talking about how great they are this also helps a social anxiety by the way social anxiety again they won't make you feel high they won't interfere at all for me anyway because there are such a low dosage didn't they just help smooth the edges now let's talk about the flavor these two that I have I've had one before it this one I have not tried yet so I'll try here but this one if you are a fan of spicy stuff which I am I love spicy it's got a nice little heat to it it's not spicy enough for me so it's not like flaming hot level but there's a little heat you know you feel in the back of your throat as you're sucking on it and the cucumber is really nice and refreshing so this is a really good choice I have other flavors of this that I like but this one definitely is is a go-to if you like a little spice and you like a little heat definitely this one now this one I haven't had so I'm gonna try it and let you know what I think mmm they come packaged individually so whether you know this was a sample this was is what I got at 4:20 hey from Phoenix suspensory and my swag bag I was so happy that I got sublime goodies oh shoot I need my scissors hold on so I find it difficult I find it difficult to cut these open on my own I mean you can't with your teeth but there's so much easier just use some scissors you know use the tools available to you in life so such as blossom then my first thought was tangerines hmm like those little halo candies but now it's kind of devolved back into like lifesavers orange that's what it tastes like lifesavers orange so the initial yumminess in my mouth it's still good but the initial mmm tangerine kind of went to orange flavor it's good I like it I'm pretty sure something have the same effect I mean as everything else does that sublime makes yeah okay so anyway this is gonna be short one there's really nothing more for me to talk about sublime products the flavors of these candies are good they're not too sweet for a hard candy I think that's great I don't want too much sugar even though I love it and I know that's important for some of you would diabetes so not too sweet these are really great 10 milligram THC again cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom both great helped a lot with anxiety if you want to get a high off of them I'd eat a bunch but keep in mind there's only five in a pack I got these for $8 I believe I eight dollars five and a five of these little candies so 50 milligram is basically for eight bucks which is not bad it's pretty much in line with everything else but again if you need the high feeling take more than one then then just figure out what your dosages for you as with everything else so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this candy you all have a great day thanks for stopping by if you like my videos and you want to

welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and Jake is making candy today and we're gonna ask the question where did the idiom blowing a raspberry come from because it seems to have nothing to do with raspberries but it does these fruit drop rollers are a little different than most of the ones we have you see these raspberry rollers are asymmetrical the top and bottom are distinctly different and they create the top and the bottom of the raspberry and this is cool because when you put one of these in your mouth it kind of feels like a raspberry because you get that 3-dimensional shape you don't even realize you're connected with it this is sort of like the strip effect that we covered in our video number 73 and while I found studies that cover flavors and colors with this strip effect I haven't found any that covers texture so I find these interesting the flavor and color was added when the candy was in the pot but Jake now sprinkles on some citric acid that'll give it just a little tang and make it taste more raspberry like I've always been fascinated with words and the origins of them and sometimes words can be confusing so let me give you three words to think about entomology etymology and entomology etymologies of course the study of bugs etymology is the study of words and entomology is the study of snack cakes and while the third study might be useful we're going to concentrate on the second study and go back to the origin of blowing a raspberry because it has a fascinating story one that takes British television British censors American TV and the paranoia of movie studios all together to add a term to the English language that's an unusual term in the first place so while Jake flips the candy to even the temperature and lets it drip he needs to get it all to the right consistency to go through the machine clearly let's go back to the early days of television television was on unlike the early internet it was struggling for content it could make some but it needed more than it could make and the movie studios in the United States were not being cooperative they were scared of television they were afraid it was going to destroy their business so they didn't want to license them their blockbusters they did license the monster movies that they thought they'd never show again like two Creature from the Black Lagoon which will be in another video by the way and they also did old old films like ah The Three Stooges Laurel and Hardy and our gangs sometimes known as The Little Rascals but what they ended up doing was leaving an opening but American television found a solution that was England you see the British film companies didn't see a threat from the American film companies in post-world War two and for many years after that people in the United States got their first real exposure to British movies and it was a good one and we absorbed accents we considered the British accent cool I think it paved way to the British revolution in music and the acceptance of it here in the United States but it also added words to the lexicon and one of them was blowing a raspberry that sound that you make when you're disappointed with things sometimes known as the Bronx cheer the writers in British films started using terms like blowing raspberries because there were censors in the British film system and there were pretty major cutting things out these sensors were originally employed during World War two to censor letters movies to keep information from going to the enemy but after the war they found a job the censoring films for the public's quote-unquote protection and the directors and writers found this stifling so they try to get around this by putting things in the censors didn't know but the public might and one of the things they used was London rhyming slang sometimes known as cockney rhyming slang if you're not familiar with it it's two words that rhyme with another to confuse the upper classes and the police so table and chair would mean stair but you wouldn't say table and chair you just say table you'd have to know stair to get to chair and for another example is frog and toad being rode well there you had a term raspberry tart but if you think for a second you might be able to figure out what raspberry tart rhymed with fart so because London used rhyming slang in people knew it the movies could use it to get around the censors in England when the movies came to the United States that were shown on American television because the television companies couldn't get American movies and a term entered the English lexicon that meant the term that the sound blowing a raspberry makes and I loved it came full circle there's the Golden Raspberry award that now gives awards for bad movies and the name of that award is the same linguistic origins as the name for sticking your face in a baby's belly and making a funny noise that makes it laugh and if you haven't figured it out already there's a reason why these candies are called drops thank you for watching if you like this video please go to our website www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam

with an exclusive look at what we should expect this October we're joined now by B and M Bloomberg's David George cos you've got a great piece on our website with all of these details but tell us what to expect so Canadians should expect a big laundry list of new products to hit the cannabis store shelves this October when they should be formally legalized a total to be exact of 17 new products and that ranges from concentrates beverages edibles and topicals there's a very long list I'm not going to say what every one of these 17 products are although we have something that you'll see up on our screen right there but this is going to really dramatically increase the scope of the cannabis market here in Ontario and we've been talking about for the past several months on the sluggish start there's been supply shortages there's been issues in terms of retail rollout but now the the actual amount of products we can disclose is going to expand fourfold from what we currently have on the market that's going to be great for producers in terms of sales figures and and the interest generated by that but it's also going to square up the legal market with the illicit market so there's been a lot of discussion how the illicit market the black market is still flourishing but once you're gonna have the same products that the black market already has in place these will be formally regulated you know great hopefully great products that will that we'll be able to squeeze out that black market player and and really generate a lot more revenue for for these cannabis producers I have so many questions please okay the first one is I understand a producer making cannabis and then selling that cannabis but when we're talking about chocolates and candies are the cannabis companies we talk about like all these hot stocks they know how to make chocolate sinan how to make candy they're learning - okay sure and and we've got facilities and they're doing that and they are yeah that's right one example I just want to bring up is Organa Graham which is a Moncton New Brunswick based cannabis producers one of the top ten in Canada and of their their capacity they've hired a specialty kitchen and they're building a special chocolate food processing plant for this particular product to have cannabis infused chocolates hit the market this October and that's just one example can't be growth the biggest cannabis company in the world is putting the finishing touches on their bottling line in Smiths Falls Ontario \u00e1free\u00e1 down in Leamington has a very high-tech automated facility to process a lot of these concentrate materials such as rosin and wax and Shatter descriptions you can read in my story I don't think we have enough time to really describe what each one of these are but but there's going to be the second wave of Canada's products it's going to be very exciting for the industry and now we have a little bit of clarity on what exactly these products are going to be and then what about the marketing like we did all this coverage around what the products could look like when we had legalization and there are some restrictions from the government on what what things can look like they're about candy and chocolate or like we're moving into an area where it's all about the packaging and the colors and the fancy titles what's the balancing act they're like well as it stands a lot of these packaging requirements are going to be that that we see for flour products are going to be set in place for these edibles and extractables nothing's really going to change as far as the proposed draft regulations go you're still going to have a very significant warning label as well as a very you know large warning sign that this is a cannabis product which is going to be bigger than the actual brand itself there is a lot of lobbying going on right now between these producers and the industry and the government to see if there's a middle ground that they can say look we get it we don't want to make sure that these products are going to be marketed to children however you have to be a little bit flexible in terms of how it can actually market this to the Canadian consumer this is a huge thing I think about I mean as much as there's demand for it I do have this fear about you know kids somehow mistaking this stuff the other question I wanted to ask you and I'm serious about this a lot of the CEOs have said they're not cannabis users are they trying these products because if taste is important now with edibles shouldn't they be like seeing if this stuff tastes good isn't that going to be the first thing the people who haven't tried edibles before think about when they're consuming this can of yeah that's tastes good it's like when you're the king and you have like a royal tester to make sure that the soup that you have is employees in there you want to make sure that so these are good so you know it's it's that's a hard question for me to answer I just they're gonna be out there they're gonna talk about how great their product is but if they haven't tried their product so so I did a story a while back for the BNN Bloomberg website we're about two-thirds of Canadian cannabis CEOs actually do use cannabis okay so a lot of that being said every one of these companies also has a very significant Quality Assurance Department where there's someone hired and their only job is to test all the cannabis products out there the company's own as well as their competitors yeah to make sure that their quality is up to stuff and as well that they're you know they're competitors aren't doing better than they are so there are people out there and making sure that what they what they're producing is actually good product I was going to say in fairness like we're talking about Tyson Foods earlier I didn't say does the Tyson's food CEO eat chicken or meat but I'm just curious about it", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "vK9gUUY376g": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "AWqTWDBveMc": "what's up guys my name is mike and this is caitlin hi today we're going to be trying five different flavors of cotton candy now it's going to be a game we don't know any of the flavors of the cotton candy and the loser has to eat carolina reaper cotton candy now first up i'm not really sure what it is but it looks pretty good um i'm gonna see a bit of peace jesus it feels good it feels a lot better than just like cotton candy that you'd get from like a like a fair or something yeah like it doesn't feel like light and like it's dense i don't know this one's oh wow this one's good at first it was like super sweet and then it's like a little nutty the aftertaste is kind of spicy yeah the aftertaste just hates you in the throat but it's like a good like like i could eat like a ton of that it's almost like a chili yeah like a chili you really taste it like after the spiciness after let's see what do you think it is some sort of chili flavor it's like i don't know it's like sweet and then it can't just be like normal i mean now i'm gonna say chili like some sort of chili like um like it tastes like um like what are those peanuts called honey like honey roasted peanuts with like some chili on it yeah yeah yeah are we right close it's pecan green chili okay okay well hey that was pretty that was still pretty like close it was like a little sweet you can definitely taste the chili yeah definitely taste the chili it's like really freaking good um all right up next is this this one is like an orange flavor i noticed that the flavors are kind of so yeah so i'm like right now i'm thinking like maybe like orange or peach i'm gonna get a nice big chunk of that it smells good oh totally different way different super good i'm glad i got a little extra yeah it's like a little citrusy like i'm telling you guys this was like amazing yeah i think this one's my favorite so far like i can only eat so much cotton candy like i could probably eat like like a stick of it like if i got to like the bear or some or you see like those vending machines like in the mall i don't know if anybody's ever seen those but sometimes cotton candy's like too much but this is like addicting it's like and it's not too sweet it's like just the mouth it doesn't feel like i just ate a spoonful of sugar like yeah it actually has like it's got a really good flavor to it and the texture is nice yeah like it's crazy but it's like i don't know i'm gonna say like man i don't wanna say orange but i'm gonna say orange it tastes like orange it's like i don't know what you think like an orange tangerine type dill it tastes really good like it has a nice aftertaste too it's like i just drink some like gum it's like refreshing in a way can i get like can i get a guess breakfast breakfast maybe uh sparkling a little sparkling a little orange juice mimosa there you go oh yeah all right up next is this one and it's just it's white it's like clear i mean it smells good i wonder what this means i'm just getting my hands all up in there thank you whatever look at that oh it smells sweet see and you can tell like the quality of this like it's not i mean i've seen cotton candy like this like oh i mean look it still well that one's really sweet right and look like you know cotton candy just melts on your tongue like it actually has some sort of consistency wow that one's really sweet oh my god um huh this one's definitely definitely like a maple flavor in there at first it's sweet i taste like like a smoky like a smoky like yeah like a beef jerky almost yeah there's like a sweetened smokiness to it but the aftertaste is like i don't know now i've had like cotton candy that tastes like like meat like bacon cotton candy but it's been like oh my gosh like terrible we went to the dollar store went to the dollar store and i'm sorry my window is open and it's the wind is insane but don't mind that um but i've had bacon cotton candy and it tastes like like dog food like it's gross it's really freaking nasty they sell at the dollar store if you get it try it it's terrible um but it's just like i don't know it's good it tastes like it's sweet but it's got like a smoky flavor yeah it actually tastes like i don't want to say like it tastes like bacon but like it's not like it doesn't taste like artificial like a maple bacon like it doesn't taste like movie bacon it tastes like bacon like if you just went home and cooked some bacon and you ate it it's really good like that's what it tastes like does it make your face make a baby okay i got that one yeah that one is good yeah that one is really good it sounds gross but it's actually pretty good let's see up next this is another just plain white looks like the stuff that would be in my pillow it's nice and fluffy this one is very fluffy this one smells good is this one can we just eat this one no no this one's definitely different i don't know what this one is is it it's spicy what i don't know you don't taste it it's got it's got a little bit of spice dude you're crazy no i'm serious you're lying i'm not lying i need another piece maybe i just fell off there's like a tiny bit of spice to it like get a smaller piece and like put it in your mouth oh it's spicy like a little bit not like okay i just got a totally different piece like huh hold up it's not unbearably spicy but there's a little bit he's eating all the cotton candy shut up i don't know what it is i really have no idea what this one is huh it is spicy yeah and it's spicy not like it's not like spicy spice there's like a hint of spiciness to it it's like i never got like some tahini and like put it on the lime like is it like a chili another chili one watermelon lime chili okay oh okay that makes sense i think there's like i don't know i thought i could really taste something i got one and i was like huh yeah i wonder are we even keeping track of coins she did the she had the maple one and then she had the chili lime one i think they're almost like neck all right let's try this one the pretty pink color cotton candy this one definitely looks like just your og cotton candy like you know what does it taste like i know right now yeah original has to be original or like the regular cotton candy flavor it just tastes like um like traditional yeah cotton candy i'm not sure what the flavor is but definitely just like yeah it's like i don't know it just tastes like it tastes like cotton candy but like like the flavor is more intense like everything is like what i've noticed with these cotton candies is everything is more flavorful it's more intense yeah like compared to the ones you buy in the store there's not as much flavor as this one yeah yeah so next video blindfold taste test comparison store-bought cotton candy versus sugar drips cotton candy and we're gonna see if we notice any difference right now i'm noticing a difference yeah but i don't want to be biased but i'm going to definitely say this is like an original

another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "89BV6rVYOBI": "and what's

bit on like how I'm feeling right now I'm feeling cold I'm feeling tired I wanted to knock out soon that's kind of what edibles do to me I have a hard time staying up on them I'm probably fifteen sixteen hundred milligrams deep first time in my life so forgive me if I don't finish it I might try my best to I just feel like if I finish you right now I'm gonna be knocking out way too early you

guys that turned off so I said add around 30 minutes so around like an hour and 23 minutes right now and I'm really dreading this challenge I think 1500 1600 milligrams is already way too much you guys I don't know if I should personally take this 400 milligrams I'm way too high I don't remember the last time I've ever felt like this it it feels like drugs I know it's still kind of early I don't know what I'm doing I feel like I just want to go home right now but um yeah I'm tapping with you guys soon I feel like I'm flying right now you guys I'm only going 40 I'm so high so that felt so [ __ ] crazy I feel like I'm gonna die with this guy's driving right now it's not gonna drink the rest of this I hate the surfing bottom as a [ __ ] worst just trying to race right now damn I don't know about you guys the edibles to me feels like absolute [ __ ] tap I don't know why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings today you guys and I'm just feeling the effects of the first bottle right now so I feel like the second ball is still gonna hit me and I'm just gonna be floored we're on our way right now back to my pad we're about to run some 2k you know we've gotta go to Chipotle guys I'm hungry as [ __ ] right now when I get high as [ __ ] I need something to bring me back before this like super smacks me down

You can take a guess at what we're going to make today. So now I'm mixing in the white colour which is going to be the face of the Panda and background of the candy. The green is going to be the wrap of the candy. Since Panda's like bamboo a lot, we figured to make the outside of the candy green to resemble the bamboo's colour. We put some of the candy in a frying pan... the reason is that it's easier to control when we have many different colours. So now I'm about to put the malic acid into the black part. It's the kind of acid we put in our non-citrus flavours, to make the flavours more robust. So Guava is kind of a sweet flavour, but we still need to put in quite a bit of the malic acid. So now I'm going to pour it out. The candy is very liquidy, that means it's still extremely hot. It's about 180\u00b0 Fahrenheit which is still too hot for us to make a shape with it. So we're going to let it cool down a little more. This big piece is also cooling down, so we're going to check if it's cool enough to put in the acid. We don't want to put the acid in too early, otherwise it will burn and make the candy yellow. The temperature is about right so I'm going to put in the rest of the malic acid. Now let's mix it in. As you can see, the edge of the candy has already cooled down. It makes it easier to separate. I need to separate this really quick, and to be accurate. So later on I'm going to stretch this big yellowish mixture. We're going to make this shiny and white by using a technique we call sugar pulling. So what's she's doing right now, is cooling the candy down with her hands folding them, making sure it has an even temperature all around As you can see, it's no longer as soft as it was earlier. The candy mixture even right now is extremely hot. How do I know? I learned the hard way. Look at my battle scars. [laughs] You will be very surprised... we are working with something extremely dangerous and hot. Right now I'm stretching this big piece on a hook. What I'm doing is called sugar pulling, candy stretching... many different names but basically what I'm doing is folding air into the candy so it will reflect more light The tiny air bubbles also help make the candy very crunchy. What I'm pulling is about 6 Kilograms of sugar. I have to keep pulling this at a steady speed. This is truly quite a workout. A few more stretches, we're almost there. At the end, this big piece is becoming harder to pull, because it is cooling down a little bit. That's why we have to do it really fast, when we get the chance. We're done. Now it's so white and shiny... and it's so fluffy. This is going to be our panda. You may ask, why don't we use the hook again? It's too small for the hook. It will cool down too fast. That's why she'll do it by hand on the table, while still warming the candy. This requires a lot of physical strength as well. I'm just happy to have a break. [laughs] You may notice the black is no longer very dark. It became kind of a silverish grey. But Don't worry, the final result will be very dark, and black. So now I will start to make the panda. We will make his eyes first. So I cut a little piece of white off, let's get a little piece of black - to be his eye ball. You may ask why we're only making one eye, when a real panda has two eyes. Well, in the candy making world, we try to make things that are identical only once. So later on you can see how we turn this one eye into two eyes. To make the piece, I'm applying a little bit of water on it. And then we're going to put the eye ball right in the middle. Then let's wrap the black with the eye white. Then roll it out. Then I'm going to take this black piece right here and make the panda's most important symbol on his face which is his lovely eye shadow. So now we're going to make this one bigger. So we will be able to wrap the eye we just made. So earlier you saw were were applying two pieces of candy together with water. Water is really like a superglue when we make candies. They help two pieces of candy that are a bit cold to stick together. When the candies are hot they just stick on their own. So now we already made one eye for the panda. Now we will turn that one eye into two eyes. It's actually very simple. When we make candies and we need to make multiples of identical pieces we simply stretch it and cut it into the quantity that we want. In this case we're going to seperate the one eye into two eyes. Now I'm going to cut this piece. So as you can see we've already finished the two eyes of the panda. For the nose it's going to be a little downwards triangle. The mouth is going to be two half circles with black outlines on them. Like I said earlier, we're just going to make one piece, then cut that in half. We have our panda's face all assembled. You may not see the entire panda yet, but soon. Now we'll just make his face fatter. It's face is nearly complete, we're just going to make an outline of black, to draw his face. We have to remember to leave some black to make the ear. Now... it's big round face. Now we just have to make it's ear. Now the panda is inside the roll. What's left is to make a final wrap using our green. The reason why we have to constantly roll the candy is that the table is heated. If we don't constantly roll, the candy will become flat and the image inside will become disoriented. So now we're going to stretch this big candy into small pieces that are bitable sized. Now it's about ready, this is how we make it small! Thank you very much for watching the video. My name is Lin. This is a customized lollypop made of real sugar.

Until next time... have a sweet day!", "iKfrUuFzfKw": "hey guys welcome to cannabis infusion today we'll be making chocolate infused strawberries this is a create date night idea a great arts and crafts great dessert and a great appetizer so to do this we require milk chocolate some Oreos that were crushed up strawberries of course most importantly you require some can of butter it looks a little nasty but I'll show you the recipe and it's absolutely delicious let's get started first and foremost you need to cut the strawberries alright guys the next step is to grab a pot and fill it up with water so now the water is boiled well you're gonna want to do you want to take a stainless steel bowl stainless steel is a great conductor of heat what you're gonna do you're gonna put it on top when pouring water you want to make sure you don't pour all the way to the top so that the water doesn't overflow next up you're going to take your can of butter looks disgusting and you're going to put about a teaspoon of the butter and you're going to see it right away already melting you want to mix it up a little you want to turn down the heat you can see how beautiful the butter is melting in the buds a couple more seconds guys one thing guys wear a glove the stainless steel it's a great conductor of heat and you will get burned so as you can see I have my butter almost it and I'm going to just pour it aside we're going to save it for later next step you're going to bring the bowl back on and now we're gonna melt the chocolate so you guys want to make sure to keep stirring the chocolate to prevent it from burning it's almost there one thing too we guys could do is to add some milk milk will help make it a little creamier alright guys so as you could see there's still a little bit of chunks left in the chocolate but you just keep mixing it until you get a clean and clear texture I'm extremely happy with the way it's coming out so like this is a great time to add that melted so you're gonna do you're gonna grab your mixture that we previously melted and all you do dip it in now just mix it you want to turn off the heat completely and keep mixing make sure not to stop at this time as it's vital or else the chocolate will condense and become very very hard last but not least we can't forget our crushed Oreos you're gonna just dip them in awesome guys now we're ready to do the fun part alright guys now we're back to our chopping table so what we're gonna do you're gonna grab your strawberry very kind of lather it in look I'm gonna set it aside to dry and you're just gonna keep doing it with all the rest of the strawberries you could either dunk the whole thing just the tip now you could do is all ranges of chocolate alright guys we're gonna speed this up for you guys so you're not bored watching TV all this now you guys are going to want to do this as fast as you can possibly as the chocolate will start to harden and won't stick so ideally you could also use a fork to dip it in but why not just get down and dirty all right that's strong now you have it I'll display it in a nicer way but this is what you get the most delicious chocolate infused cannabis infused strawberries thanks guys for watching subscribe and watch more videos", "SmEIe45TtOA": "they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an O a V and E a y OU and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they could also twist rods into lollipops", "3vrcTHZakaw": "yes yes brothers and sisters out there how are we doing how are we doing yes yes it's me it's me it's the it's justin how are we doing out there we've got a little bit of a review for you people today it's a special one um the ninja's been out and about and um she's managed to get me one of these um i did take one of these on one of my earlier reviews it wasn't like this it was somebody's homemade one that they did um it didn't look like this at all the one i had was flat so obviously let me just show you a bit closer so this is obviously uh the millions rope or rope s milligrams okay so it's quite a high dosage um it's certainly the highest dosage i've had in a sweet up till now there's warnings all over it which is really good so you know the packaging is fantastic it is just like a normal commercial suite you'd have to be careful with this obviously if you had children in the ace or anything like that you'd have to make sure this was really really away from them it does say 18 plus on it it is quite clear that there's cannabis in it let me just read it for you so you know so for um medicinal use only or medical use only keep out a reach of children and and animals so yeah if you've got a dog or a cat they might eat it so yeah it says tear and share uk net weight 52 grams um this is the strawberry flavor so very very nice ingredients organic cane sugar corn syrup gelatin citric acid calories extract full strength that's what i was looking for um color red yellow yellow white beeswax and vegetable oil so yeah there's nothing in there which really sort of alarms me to be fair see all seems pretty kosher um g magic sweet so there you go guys if you've seen them well you must have seen them because at the minute um we get sort of offered more sweets than anything um it's obviously overtaking the market quite a bit at the minute and i would say looking at these products now would tell you that you are getting really really really close to legalization now just look at it look at how it's packaged like say you would not know that or distinguish that from a normal suite right you just wouldn't right so that to me tells me that the cogs are moving they're in movement right first of all i think we're better on [ __ ] bombs right so cheers people one laugh um i'm gonna be obviously making this video which will be the eating video the taste test we'll call it so we'll do the taste test on this video and then obviously after about 60 minutes it says 60 minutes on there which i know that's about right um obviously we'll have a look at the effects and see what it does so um it says there's eight there's eight um servings there um obviously i've got quite a high tolerance so i'm going to take about six servings all in one day all right cheers which would literally be the most of my i've taken in a suite although i took the fifo the other day which is fight a thousand milligrams that's a different catch [Music] [Music] still on the cheese don't judge me for it it's the only flavor i can get in a minute we have had a bit of star dog as well so um but yeah it is it's going a little bit scarce in a minute let's say we're getting more sweets than anything so which is good i'm fine with that give the lungs a little break for a little while right then we'll pop that out for a minute but as you guys know cheers right i think it's about time to uh crack this sweet open that okay so 800 milligrams here we go let's have a look at it first what's it look like can you get it out just [Music] i assume the millions aren't medicated oh rocky now look so basically in a nutshell it's just squishy obviously what's medicated is the jelly in the middle by the look of it so yeah well then let's just stop [ __ ] about josh let's just get it down here it says it's strawberry but it's green [Music] but you can taste the cannabis huh [Music] oh my god we really taste the calorie [Music] stuff i didn't get that taste from the other it's strawberry because there's millions yeah if you see millions if a strawberry but the strawberry's masking oh i can taste it now [Music] you know when you get cannabis in your mouth like fecal or calories oil it burns your mind for a little bit you know i'm getting that almost at the back of my mouth [Music] i mean i wonder if there is an accurate dose [Music] cheers [ __ ] struggling this is breakfast [Music] [Music] [Music] a little bit [Music] i mean what i like about it more than anything is a lot of these sweets they actually mask the taste of the cannabis so it's like has it got anything in it hasn't it got anything i know damn well this has got something in it because i could taste it it's very very strong [Music] oh mate [Music] you're not having it's mine [Music] people [Applause] we'll see how strong this really is i mean i think the peach rings that i did a review on i think they were 400 milligrams and the other edible ones like the the um sour bright crawlers they were 300 milligrams in a packet so 600 milligrams i should really if i had a whole one i think i'd probably be on my back but maybe i'll do a whole one next time we'll see well 600 milligrams [Music] oh dear it's very very strong tasting i did not expect it to taste um as strong as it does in cannabis and it's um it's really really overpowering like i say the other one i had did not i can taste the fika or whatever it is cannabis oil in this it's right in the back of my mouth and it's overpowering but that's good because i know that it's [ __ ] loaded it knows it's loaded [Music] that much a little bit [Music] [Music] wow [Music] that's the only thing with these reviews [Music] looked completely different than the last one i had well the last one i was more flat out it was more like a belt it was more like a belt basically whereas that was like a rope um well it is like a rope you can see it quite clearly it's like a rope so but yeah six doses in one go [ __ ] hardcore you know me and i say if i get a good effect off here i'll get a whole one i'll do a hole in one go one night and see what that's like so oh really it's burning it's burning i know that's not a good advertisement for it but it just it has to if it's got cannabis in it it's gonna have some sort of effect when you eat it you've got to be able to taste it like that it's very very strong what's in that so i would say just i know you can't go by it but just by the taste alone i would say that that was probably a pretty accurate dose either that or they've got some serious cannabis [ __ ] flavoring put into it to make it taste like that which i doubt very very very much so i mean it says it takes um 60 minutes on there we know that edibles can take anywhere from like you know i mean 45 minutes to hour and after it's for the effect so the time is now five past 11 of the so we'll call it 11 o'clock as i started eating it probably five minutes ago because i was chewing it like [ __ ] as you saw um so yeah we'll go from there really we'll see what happens at five past twelve and see what i'm like i'll probably be hunting burgers down by that type well yeah let's get another pipe on the go people so yeah i hope you're all well hope everyone's in a good positive mood love the lovers [ __ ] the haters people yes yes one love here we go [ __ ] cheers fun time please join me smoke up choke up roll up you know where we go from here no mess of the bay we just smoke weed and we get [ __ ] higher yes yes let's do it cheers nice nice people nice nice chest [Music] [Music] hey cheers people peace one love to all of you and have a fantastic day you'll see me really soon anyway because i'll be making another video in an hour's time so um yeah i'll see you really really soon i hope you get a good [ __ ] giggle out of what's going to be coming next because i do tend to go off a little bit while i've added some edibles so peace of my love guys see you really really soon one love cheers for watching", "o3weg_vvpbk": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries

I think it's time. I shared it with you This is the way my mom always made it It's a little bit different from just throwing some sugar on some strawberries and letting them sit until they get juicy. This is definitely a Gourmet version of a strawberry shortcake topping I can't wait to show you how this all comes together Okay, we're gonna go over all the ingredients. I just thought it was a great idea to share with you I didn't realize that I had never shared with you How I make strawberries for strawberry shortcake and since it is strawberry season it's time To have strawberry shortcake, so we're gonna have some tonight for dessert And I thought what better time to share this then now I have about 4 1 pound boxes of strawberries that I have washed taking the tops off up and Quartered mostly some of the extra-large ones I just sliced by cutting them in half and then slicing them in you know four or five different pieces so I have three of them here, and then I have one in this mason jar here, and I'll tell you why because When I make strawberries for shortcake I make them Romanov style now This is how my mom used to call it, and it's it's just so much nicer than just throwing sugar on some strawberries and having them macerate and that means to stew in their own juices and The sugar will draw out those natural juices and give you a nice. You know strawberry syrup that you can pour over your Shortcake or your angel food cake I like my strawberry shortcake on pound cake Ric prefers his on Angel food cake so in our house. We usually have both so Here's my strawberries and then what I'm gonna do with these strawberries is I'm gonna put them in my little mini chopper here Let's get them all in there And then just whack them up Now you don't want to turn these into a puree you just want them to be ground up a little bit There we go See these are not pureed.

candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "hFAmvbrX07E": "well hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "xlfkPFBW36o": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary let's melt down some butterscotch we're gonna try to make some hard candies with our SL and let's open some of these I put 20 in here we have 1/2 gram let's melt them down I highly suggest using a rubber spatula we're trying to stir this mixture because it's gonna get stuck on everything else even though I swear when you cook with these I will never lick the spatula because it tastes like rubber okay it's a weird taste to it so well melting these down you just kind of want to keep stirring it so we don't burn it we're get it stuck to the bottom it will start to melt if you want it to go a little quicker you can smash them up first but I kind of want to see how long it took just to melt when I need the Jolly Ranchers on here we had them crushed up and I had them on low forever they just it turn into this weird like you dumb mixture ooh so I'm trying them from full and I'm gonna go a little bit higher I have it [Music] when these all get melted we're just gonna add straight our so to it and I think a little butter but I don't know that I would add anything else so if you still want that candy to get part again and here we start adding all this sticky stuff I'm not sure that it would solidify and starting to clump together keep stirring the hardest part is judging like how many you're gonna make I put in 20 hard candies I'm going to use half a gram or so it's so hard to dos when we just need peanut butter cookies doesn't that look like peanut butter I think it was a good idea that we didn't start on low started around four but I don't even think it's been ten minutes and it's almost ready for the RSO and butter ah broke this dang injector maybe this will work [Music] ding-ding-ding we have a winner [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's a piece of plastic but I don't want to waste all this I'm gonna pour it in here everything's ready to go it gets cold fast and you want to pour it back [Music] [Music] you were there you were there I know you're incorporated with the mixture damn it give any court ring for top number two [Music] [Music] so like to see which is a little lip on it [Music] so far we have a nice little mixture [Music] [Music] we had a butter double chocolate [Music]", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "gRahhO7E9Rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah B and welcome to the haze today we were gonna be doing an edible review BAM the standard this guy is the hybrid Andrea this guy is pineapple first off let me just tell you guys I cannot find anything about this company online no website is on the box there's no no website I can find it you search their name so I have no idea where these guys come from I have no idea about their background but whatever you guys are using the balm products let's just go on the pineapple which is here in the indica the flavor that these guys have is is is the these guys I can honestly say are the best tasting gummies I've ever had obviously Medicaid they come in these little packets so this is a 200 milligrams so these guys are each 50 there's four of them and they taste they taste like they taste familiar but they are so good I love these also they don't come GUI like that my just melted I didn't make just I absolutely love these got me he's like I'm kind of obsessed I'm never going back they are also generally when it comes to your mood and how you on them you're gonna be kind of happy at least for me and my experiences have been very uplifting and they've been very positive I don't go in any type of cycle as well at least for me they're not overly strong what is really great so if you want something where you're gonna be able to like lay around your house and watch TV these are a perfect choice so if you find yourself in California or if you live in California and you're in the Southern California region at least I know that I see these from time to time and I would pick one up they also are at a really great price especially compared to sake and because you punch I only compare them because they're both gummies these you will find much cheaper again my name is Sarah P thank you so much for watching the channel the haze and again this is your guys who have cannabis infused lifestyle there's gonna be more videos different hoes so I hope you guys enjoy it please leave a comment below please hit that like button please share and I

in the morning and I got one of these to get me through the day this is a medicated nerds rope seriously strawberry 400 milligrams of THC this is going to be wild yo it says I like I don't show you guys the whole thing just like sharing hair I get from Cali it says da right there I'm in Maine so other side of the country I shoulda thought about the fact I have braces it doesn't feel like I should be eating it and like 10:00 in the morning but you get strong but no this is obviously gonna take a while so I'm just gonna eat this real quick for you guys and check back in later at some point I'm dropping little nerd [ __ ] everywhere [ __ ] sweet I like don't eat candy but actually not enjoying this I really don't like this it's like the Nerds of the sour pirate but I don't even think that that has any THC in it it's probably all on the gummy so [ __ ] not pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just I'm definitely kind of time just like feeling a little more tired but it's nothing like it's nothing like too crazy rolled up a little Jay got the absinthe flavored papers but he'll be here left this the main live cards as I've showed this pen yet but it's got like a little different voltage options of warm that up this cart is some blackberry Kush hybrid mostly indica so yeah I think I told you guys fun at the end of coz oh yeah let's give it a rip should I turn it down a little bit right there to about like 2.75 and then we'll take a blinker and hey I hate it like it's so awkward because like the cart [ __ ] never like screws on to like match up with the button so like five buttons right in front the [ __ ] mouthpiece is like awkward Cheers now I'm pretty big but I want to try some [ __ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well battery's just about dead anyways plug this [ __ ] and I know I think you know this this is like a pretty decent edible for me I just I need to take more but now mm-hmm I hope you guys enjoy the video I'm definitely gonna be takin I'll do a video of me taking a shitload more edibles um have like a big-ass me I'll have like a bunch of different [ __ ] to eat drinks it's actually a dope idea anything but no drop a like if you guys enjoyed the video comment and favorite way to smoke away smoking from state country whatever but yeah stay lifted everybody have a good a stay in peace y'all", "U3IdxTpVE04": "hey guys today I have something a little bit different how about some old-fashioned hard candy not only made the old-fashioned way but with chili peppers hey guys how's it going to spill more back again with another hot and spicy product to review for you guys know today I have something a little bit different just like I said in the intro I have some old-fashioned hard candy made the old-fashioned way and made with chili peppers these were sent to me I've got three of them to review today these were sent to me from the chess pros handmade confections I believe I'm seeing that right chess Bros handmade confections are located I'm not too far up the road from where I live in Thomasville North Carolina let me go ahead and read what it says on their website it says we trace our candy making routes all the way back to the Davis candy company located in 1910 in Springfield Missouri the business has changed hands and names several times over the years but one thing remains constant our commitment to making quality products for our customers I thought this was really cool it says we still use most of the original candy making equipment today copper pots gas stoves wooden paddles and vintage turn-of-the-century candy making equipment you can taste the difference that quality makes now you can check them out at chess bros confections dot-com I'll put that link down in the description and they've got a fantastic website guys they not only have these old-fashioned hot candies I'll be reviewing they're three spicy ones they've got other flavors as well they've got soft candies they've got Brittles which look amazing fudge dip mixes desert mixes snack mixes gift items they've got fruit slices just a some awesome looking products so let's go ahead and get into these guys this one's the first one I'm not gonna sit here and eat these for you here on this video review but I've tried them several times they're mango habanero just look at that these come in four and a half ounce size packs but very large pieces of hard candy probably at least thirty in here this has a very very delicious mango habanero flavor it's the mildest of the three not much heat from this one at all but a really nice delicious fruity mango type flavors what you're getting from from this one I think this would be for everybody it's really not that spicy I'd probably put the heat on my one to ten scale at about a 1 out of 10 but very very delicious so this is their mango habanero if you like that combination if you especially if you love mango and fruit and you love hard candies I definitely recommend this one now this one is delicious guys this is moving up in the heat department a little bit this is their whoops their orange ghost chili hot candy look at that dragon on there and now this has a nice sweet and sour blood orange type base to it I think this is the favorite of three this has a little bit more heat coming from the Ghost Pepper so you definitely can tell that it's got more heat than the mango habanero it just kind of fills your mouth all over with with a very very to me low level ghost pepper type burn but super super delicious blood orange flavor to this one with a little more heat I'd probably put this one maybe at a 3 out of 10 oh my one to 10 scale it's kind of hard to give heat ratings for candies it's so subjective but I'm just trying to give you an example of how I would rate them for heat so maybe that will help you and then this one here guys this is their hottest one this is the one made with Carolina Reaper now if you love cinnamon type candy if you love Hot Tamales or if you love a those fireballs you're probably going to really love this one so it's got a nice cinnamon spicy flavor to it this is the hottest of the three and I think it's probably seems a lot hotter than maybe you what it is because of the cinnamon I think cinnamon candies sometimes come across as being a little bit more spicy but you could definitely tell that because of the Carolina Reapers it are in here this is spiced up probably to about a 5 out of 10 on my one to ten scale the longer you keep it in the mouth you got to give these time as you suck on them and keep them in your mouth you've got to let it dissolve a little bit and then you can start getting more of the flavor you could start getting feeling more of the heat to sum this one they may want to take this out of their mouth for a while and put it down and maybe get something to drink it may reach that level to some but it does you know heat the mouth up pretty good with that nice awesome fiery cinnamon flavor so about a five out of ten for heat on my window ten scale but great candies highly recommended once again this is the Carolina Reaper hot candy I think the favorite to want to really enjoy the most is this one this is the orange ghost chili hot candy I really loved that blood orange base and then the very mildest of all of them once again is the mango habanero hot candy so thank Texas Company out guys once again the chess pros confections calm link will be down in the description

[Music] all right you guys ready oh yeah yeah we were thinking this might be like colored or something your mom's like well let's wait and see the color of the flavor before we decide to color the batch it is clear clear color it smells fantastic oh it smells so good um i figure we'll start with three taste tests and then pretty much all of those are four but this smells so strong that i figure we'll just do three at first sound good to you yeah you can taste test it real quick that is uh you got the hood on no i don't even have a hood on my shirt dude that's really good though it reminds me of like the triple x vitamin water it's like a little weird right it's going water-based or something oh it does this all of them i just never stood up flavors in that's usually your dad you're you're dead huh you're dead you're dead no you oh come on boys you can both be dead oh yeah all cool do you think he needs any more is it good i think i taste it oh that's like between that and the taste of the wooden stick that's reminded me of like an old lollipop or uh popsicles but the grape is gonna be purple and purple so you know and we're probably gonna have to switch this up a little bit too because uh flavor is this blackberry because the raspberry is uh you know purple and white too so like are you doing that on purpose well yeah i'm trying to use gravity yeah to get it out of there i'm like i can't scrape it i thought you're teasing me like you know doing this one well you i'll just hold it no it's all good you definitely tease me every once in a while you know i would never i'm just thinking about all the different ways that your dad will mess with me no you would never do that what would you do how high can you let this come to the classic white and purple there's a song about that right purple is my favorite color oh you got enough mm-hmm oh yeah it's pretty hot yeah my lunch is [ __ ] up you're not supposed to mix it up with your finger oh wait you are supposed to make sure my finger yeah that's how you can tell if it's too hot or not it's my finger shorter and shorter oh you're made out of sugar huh yup i'm melting see you really are a witch how do you know she was a witch look at her nose she turned me into a newt is that half and half what do you think are you talking to me yeah yeah what wasn't talking to i don't know it's hard being a cameraman all right oh i'm sorry yeah you don't know what i yeah i got to work all day you guys just got to make candy and watch basketball yeah and football football's on and movies tv shows and other stuff too right all this i'm missing the good part thanks for pausing oh no i'm missing the other good part we're making them run today yeah you want to get this action right here it's almost too much to handle nothing like a new bucket of corn syrup i wish it was a little colder i guess all right so i don't want to be complaining over here but i'm gonna complain but watch me complain hey that actually works now blackberry it's made out of real cell phones thank you thank you most legitimate lap i ever got my whole way oh no i'm doing it opposite this time got him i guess i bet they said a little bit closer to the middle good work max oh you mean it yeah i would say so yeah or you could pull them both maybe at the same time can you do that dad we'll have to get another hook yeah i don't think she wants to pull the purple we're going to do it i told you i'm going to tell my sister that'd be like lavender harry yeah henceforth will be known as lavender i hope so [Music] it makes me trying to work here so me too no max i'm i'm i'm actually trying to work well he's actually doing stuff yeah right right yes yeah i mean he seems like he's working here all the noise he's making you wouldn't stop lots of lots of tests being accomplished over here well you did make that thing so well the thing's right there yeah for for reasons completely unrelated to me dropping things right just happened to also think it was a good idea um there should go hey you got it yikes [Music] hey there hey you're there oh yeah now we'll get it that'll be easy i mean it's cool too yeah i don't even see sunglasses on it dude okay all right see here just just take the slack out of it a little bit i feel like it's just like buckling you know you got enough there we go maybe maybe you're just bringing it over a little too warm you know no it's pretty cool yeah it's all in my head he's doing it that sounded just like the gorilla song [Music] remember it's all in your head that part yeah oh yeah that's it you got it that's cool i'll give you another tap and then i'll check on the other side you can just take this right off guys [Music] i guess you guys weren't kidding about that what it's really sticking to the table oh yeah it's been sickening today huh uh and yeah last time too you're right i guess he really is a dad don't make me get up now when we put these together you gotta say yeah that'll hold ah it flipped no fair all right there you go come together right now [Music] were you in the beatles yeah i was one of the many pauls named joe joe paul what kind of animals that look like a long next one you guys hear that they're starting to find a bunch of animals with like uh fur that glows in uv light they have no reason for why that would be like it was platypuses at first now it's like wombats shine a uv light on them i guess wait is that like a dark like uh like a black guy yeah so were they taking their pet one batch to raves again no they they made a ring for wombats oh yes yeah i heard that's a very lucrative business it broke out and it's hidden warm that red i did that one time and try to make them better they just get worse and worse i'm not convinced that you're not a dad man huh i'm not convinced that you're not a dad i'm not going to be swimming i don't like check your wallet i'd probably find a dad card no don't make me check your wallet well wait okay if i was a dad where would you know to check for my wallet and the wallet of your back pocket oh yeah all that's like when they sit down they sit like this yeah super big wallet in the back pocket so that was throwing my back out so i started buying cargo pants so i can keep it in the cargo pack um it was hurting my back for a while too so i started like when i was in the car i wouldn't sit on my wall i would just put it in the cup holder don't have to worry about that here it's sitting on your wallet there's no while it's allowed here yeah this is a cash-free business wallet free zone you didn't bring your wallet into work today did you no good i would i would never do that right my mom raised me right i feel like we're like racing each other well you're probably gonna win i don't know doesn't it seem like i'll get like a lot of like windy ropes over here and then you'll come and you'll pull two of them and i'm already like trying to feed you again just from doing uh candy canes the other day and then ribbon candy before that i was just like wow these hard candy messes go so much faster especially the candy canes go really slow yeah yeah the candy cane batches were like an hour and a half two hours each yeah these are like 30 minutes pulling it out and then 30 minutes you know waiting for the stove yeah that's the hardest part dudes tell me sometimes you're not sitting here like man what are we doing brittle is the most down time badge yeah just kind of wait around and then once there is time to do stuff like well i gotta go now very time sensitive and then there's nothing we got we got both sides of the board on that one i'm really excited to try these i'm really excited to try these yeah and the next batch yeah yeah pizza i think we've tried before but still i don't know yeah yeah you did a great job the first second third fourth six and seven times why don't you just just don't do it like that oh oh you did something wrong well don't do it see it was a joke to us but like for real that was some of the best advice i ever had you know when i was when i was first starting he'd be like just do it faster you know because i'd be getting all wrapped up in my head and stuff i don't think he's ever gotten very good advice before apparently it was like like you know your dad would laugh it off like he was joking but like honestly if you just stood there and you're like oh just go faster it worked he should be an olympic coach i heard it here first how do i shave time off just run faster oh brilliant the sports world changed that day tattooed your dad in front of every like every baseball stadium every football stadium every soccer stadium they really got a diverse bowling stadium soccer pitch that's a thing right is that a quidditch pitch okay hey they got it from somewhere basketball pitch ball pitch no baseball pitches though that won't make sense i could probably smoke on the water [Music] good work joe liquid cheesecake you got to make up the cheese and the cake yeah it's tough to get them to mix you know but you could get all cheese you don't want to get all cake yeah yeah yeah you're really aiming for that perfect 60 40 blend you know yeah that's the it's not always easy to get there but and you got to do it in the right order too because otherwise you end up with cake cheese nobody wants that no no i had cake cheese once as a kid spoiled the whole thing for me next what i say about cutting your nails don't don't do it the last one is you got a big day how do you pull it off the tin of a lid of a cheesecake if anybody from loran is uh watching a tab would be nice okay let's let's see we're gonna do this yeah a little little extra shake with that extra air and then you gotta do the stink test oh man so good oh man i didn't think it was gonna smell that red wow that stinks i feel full just from smelling that for real though yeah i think there's gonna be a three shot flavor too cheesecake color yeah that's exactly the home oh wow it smells so rich oh yeah i don't think i need lunch i just gotta smell this dude oh wow there's a lot of calories in that vapor maybe even i'm like kind of worried that three was even maybe too much wow i don't think i don't know if i've ever been this excited for a flavor this is yeah this is like this is like if you got birthday cake and it like came with frosting have you ever inhaled the cheesecake yeah every time i eat one so it's always this bubbly and stuff yes that's what steve was saying too but i just never do this so can the viewers smell it at home i've been working on a smell-o-vision don't overwork making grand leaps in this smelly technology all right very technically advanced here the cooler downerizer yeah you see the cold water interacts with the candy and it does something really science-y i don't want to lose people yeah you know i'm something of a scientist myself yeah yeah oh okay i'll tell you about it later that's going to be my keyboard yeah so i guess we'll do two more let's go straight for it because yeah i'm not really tasting any of that either which is weird because it smells so strong like the the blackberry that one really really really smelled and that's how we knew that it only needed three shots you know ready watch your head i watch your head if you watch mine okay he said watch right not wash whatever okay well i mean i have much less hair than you so yeah i know that's why i'm cool with that trade hey all right don't do that did you oil up the scraper just do it faster yeah man i thought that was really good advice no no because sometimes you have to do it slow max but you got to do it faster well sometimes yes [Applause] you see how clean that was i mean you really did do it a lot basketball probably go look how much better you did this time probably got to get out of here today faster yeah dude that probably just saved us like a whole 30 seconds i know yeah honestly i mean this did the taste test throw us off by like five minutes yeah but it's okay we've like been losing and gaining five minutes per bash all day just do it faster you do it faster i did it faster last time it's not my voice wow good work yeah last cattle of the day huh huh last kettle of the day last call of the day wow i mean honestly still feels like it's like eight o'clock in the morning oh yeah you guys want any windows back here nope and on these days you're on such a loop you know what i mean that just what are we doing what are we doing oh it's extremely pale yellow almost white and it's so solid yeah oh just one salad so i guess kind of like remember how we did lemonade at the beginning yeah no it's like like that much like imagine like you know cheesecake just kind of has like that yellow tint that much but it's white sure yeah we should probably have some in here for a reference but yeah just for reference oh yeah early research purposes for science hey enough playing with your food um oh it's weird i don't understand it today the last time we made candy it was doing it on uh saturday there they're checked her day yeah that's still looking sad so i passed the drip test right oh yeah yeah joe you ready to throw this i mean it's soft but but that's why i just want to have the opportunity to throw extra long if we want to to get that like real pale color right did you guys ever know anybody who could like snap their gum i mean like make it pop yeah my mom on every every chew it would be like snap snap snaps yeah it's like how do you do that see i don't know if you can see how like i just try to keep the slack out of it you know what i mean like that's what i'm trying to that's what i've been trying to say when i'm watching you but why didn't you just say it i think i said it one time but i wasn't even sure if like that really made the sense you know what i'm saying like i try to keep it really close to the hook but like i'm letting it do its thing no i had it close to the hook and said pull it far away yeah yeah like so if i was like this close you see how it's like it doesn't have enough room to like really move and stuff okay just take my stuff you could have given me it's just to do it no no to do it right do it right oh yeah oh yeah do you ever think about that joe no i bet you didn't i'm 46 years old i've never done anything right because nobody told me to i thought it was okay to mess things up i don't typically do things right either let's do the left side [Music] on the right foot though [Music] sticking a little bit yeah i think this one's probably gonna stick because i i brought it over warm oh thanks why didn't you do it right i'm getting there you see how it's still getting a little paler sure so if i brought it over later it would be too cold to keep throwing it i wanted to have like that you know eggshell sort of look [Music] your [Music] it's more the aerobic thing it's like essentially glued at this point yeah standing really far back just for the thumbnail wow it's a 24 pound batch so i can't really do that with this one too light yeah if it's heavier you can do it already yeah it just doesn't have enough body right right i think this is about as light as it's getting okay ready oh that might go on yeah it's not moving all right i'll just keep throwing up while you're hammering it for now oops sorry [Music] i don't know okay i don't know about that yeah why's it been sticking today you bring it over warm it'll stick but really we don't know smells cheesy pancake wow okay oh joe you're gonna hurt your hands and for anybody wondering why you guys hammered the hook can you explain that because i know this people's going to be asking yeah we're not allowed to give away all the secrets oh all right sorry folks all right joe can you can you be a trader and tell me it's because uh yeah the vibrational frequency matches the frequency of the candy and then it uh it's more like a quantum mechanics thing right yeah yeah yeah yeah average person would understand it you guys you're so funny and quirky all right but for real the vibrations yeah they just help it okay but a real answer yeah because i think some people be like all right so enough jokes i didn't know if you guys had actually gotten there yeah i don't know but yeah yeah hitting this sends vibrations through the hook loosens the can usually loosens the candy hopefully you can't you can't shake the hook yeah if you hit it with a hammer just like you would get out of the way if somebody was going to hit you with a hammer right the candy jumps out of the way right all right the plane's taking off [ __ ] love please return to your seats it was your turn to bring the peanuts okay i did not forget them but after this i'm gonna have to leave for a minute maybe 15 minutes it's gonna look like i'm driving to this peanut store but i'm totally not i would never no i've never been to a peanut ceremony oh i don't even know if there's one across the street peanut mince that was pretty good how often have you been following all the candy joe what's that how often have you been called pulling off the candy uh today we've been doing it like every other time like i'll throw it he'll pull it and i'll don't you hate that when you're like which way do i have to sit and then uh yeah the other way all right so um terry said that when we're done with this we have to um get a graham cracker on the bottom of each one and then cut it like so that it's perfectly square so okay i got some stuff to do so it's gonna it's gonna be all on here i can like see the logo in my head but i don't know what they're called graham crackers wait what yeah i thought those are the those are only going to your grandma name wow looks pretty that's a nice yellow it's a very eastery pastel yellow yeah i should throw it longer if we get a little bit more so every time you flip it just get smaller scared me yeah you better get out of my way working man coming true make room out of the way think these hot dogs are gonna eat themselves no i don't think so there's a hot dog stand down by the courthouse yeah i never noticed i guess i don't uh spend too much time near the focus i'm not down there all the time what were you telling me about oh never mind it's coming when you went to get the dva you were with me yeah yeah yeah but we were talking about something out out front and like the security guard or something gave us a weird look and i was just thinking back yeah oh yeah i got my dba because my mom was like oh yeah you need a dba in order to claim stuff on your taxes and i talked to my accountant he's like i don't you just need to start making money and then the things you buy and start making money you deduct them check me michael sam well thanks mom there goes thirty one dollars yeah i was just gonna say at least the dba yeah it's not really expensive and you basically just signed something all right you know what do you want us we can go talk to her we'll we'll make her pay you back mostly 31 plus interest i know you're you know you're kind of a loan shot so yeah 15 20 percent um 300 a day [Music] that was close yeah so close that was close [Music] oh yeah it's like the pre-naruto stance yeah [Music] wow you did it five minutes later i heard this all the way on the other side of the shop i was like oh max is mixing the candy people love seeing this b i wish we could take volunteers a lot of fun to play with it's just like hard to really get it all mixed up a little bit more mixing over here oh yeah uh i didn't do the bars i didn't do the top of those i didn't you know i mean they're just soaking right now i didn't wipe the bottom of the cutter i really just took it all apart waited for the grape to get cool enough and then started doing this i'm right in craig's way i know one of these days oh dude come on don't make me do that the open bottle is right next to my face i do really like watching it i do really like when i leave here hoodie and coat my whole room stinks like candy because like you always say the word stinks and i always think of it as like a negative connotation you know like i don't know how else you say like really smells [Applause] you know like when you're making turkey dinner and the whole house stinks like gravy that's what i said you should make a holiday where you eat all those things yeah i'd be really thankful yeah me too i probably want to give stuff on a day like that you guys still not know each other's names yeah that's mike and that's bill hey he's going this way you're just about there i could see cheese i think that's i think that we were just testing it out on this one we're going to do like a probably full assortment with like cheese strawberry cheesecake raspberry juice the cheesecake variety bag the blackberry said she wants those all separate flavors yeah but she said for me to mix them up and bit them and then to tell you to stay late okay she doesn't want you to go home to her i mean that just seems like the most efficient way to do it that's what we're thinking i mean if you guys can think of a more efficient way just leave it in the comments because yeah i don't i don't think it exists no oh i was like yeah i'm pretty happy with that and then i saw this spot what i'm saying i'm pretty happy about that yeah is that six feet yep all right let me see one oh my foot's not even a foot long that's different mr literal all right steve you don't have to be six feet away from me yeah you guys are in the same journal you're in the same bed all right let's get to taste testing so what do you guys wanna do first i want to try the blackberry okay i guess i could take my cheesecake too you can't take your cheesecake candy in it too i'm gonna take it and i'm gonna have my cheesecake yes i am there's nothing you can carry is this that's the yellow one blackberry's the yellow one and uh um and then what the yellow one is cheesecake and the people all man card what's that that's peach but i've already fixed it okay put that there i've got to make sure we're six feet away from max yeah all right down the hill don't come any closer all right three two one which one are we doing i forgot to sniff it first like max does i like i don't like blackberry what i like does it i like that seedless it definitely tastes like candy obviously but does it also kind of remind you almost like pop-tart filling that's what you were saying earlier i was like what are you why are you bringing up pop-tarts what are you talking about yeah the mixed berry one maybe i mean i don't nothing's that's what it tastes like it's mixed berry it reminds me a lot of the xxx vitamin water i don't know what that is here's where i go i have confession to make yeah i tried the cheesecake cheater i liked it but now i want it to be blackberry cheesecake so wow and i didn't have my dinner yet don't tell mom okay she won't watch this no probably not sounds good all right i'm gonna have a graham cracker chaser yeah all right so cheesecake next you said uh why not okay i don't care all right yeah mom already put cheesecake down the hatch though all right cheers okay it's my second nap that was so good that's wow yeah i i mean i guess i shouldn't be surprised because it's supposed to taste like cheesecake but whenever it's like unconventional flavors you're always surprised when you put it in your mouth i feel like i just put a spoonful of frosting in my mouth the other funny thing about today is we did apple pie flavor mm-hmm it's like a dessert basket cheesecake five strawberries you get strawberry cheesecake cherry cheesecake blackberry cheesecake so you were thinking of like doing a cheesecake bag in the future maybe maybe maybe maybe or a berry bag strawberry blackberry blueberry red very blue raspberry i think technically a banana botanically is considered a berry yeah i don't put it but most humans do not burn good flavors mm-hmm i can't believe we got them both right usually it's a little weak or a little funny i'll do a four it was three for the for the blackberry and four five for the cheese yeah i was gonna say it so we've done peach before i haven't tried it uh but we wanted to try peach it sounds like a peachy idea to me that should be sad all right that's the last one anyway yup oh yeah that's good it's really good it's crazy do you have your peach dad i think that one's yours isn't it you need it too good i've already had it i know it's peachy you already had this one not that one yeah it doesn't taste like peach iced tea a little bit well peach iced tea just tastes like peach tomatoes right yeah but i don't know it's like a slightly different flavor it's not like just peach yeah i feel like normal peaches although they're like mostly sweet there's like a little bit of like tang or like bite to it that's what's next iced tea flavored hard candies yeah yeah i think you're giving yourself too many ideas iced tea and lemonade and then bloody mary yeah mixed drinks summer drinks it's vodka and tomato juice and a little bit of uh hot lemon yeah and a celery stick which i would never do that i didn't actually drink alcohol i know you made him there for breakfast no that's like it's like a french drink really i thought mimosas or is that oh yeah yeah but mostly i can see that being more of a french drink but yeah bloody mary it's like yeah it's like v8 right yeah basically yeah it's pretty it's similar yeah v8 has a few more things in it first time i had v8 like i remember they were giving away samples at like the fair like this is like cold tomato soup all right well what do we have to say for ourselves i think they're all really good good job i did this because i i asked i ordered these flavors because i you did a live stream a while back and i listened to the live stream as i was working away and i heard a few people asking for a blackberry and cheesecake and i was like you know i could do that it would be fun so i did it how was the blackberry and cheesecake in your mouth combo um the blackberry overpowered i'm sorry i guess you're just gonna have to put multiple cheesecakes in your mouth yes yes that's what you have to do comes us all right here's me all right get back to work kids i'm telling corporate or your mom no no no no no it's bad enough that i had candy before dinner please craig show me some mercy all right if you get back to work [Laughter] my mom said if enough people subscribe i'll get ungrounded

subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all right so that's about all as well I hope you enjoyed it if this is the

look at an edible before we get started if you like what you see drop a sub got a bunch of different videos like this but anyway this TKO mainly known for their black market dab carts I guess you would say they also make edibles this is the strawberry Nesquik there's a surprising amount of flavors for these normally a lot of edibles they just come in like one or two flavors but there's like a whole like a whole box of em there's a ton gluten free to start off for any of you uh non-gluten eaters there's all the nutritional facts says serving size is 1 square I could see that I ate three of them 3 little squares you'll see and 315 milligrams in total and there's nine squares so I think it's like 35 milligrams a square which I'm not I'm a lightweight I do not weigh a lot I am a very light boy so just three of these have me absolutely folded I'm sure if you're if you don't if you're not like a daily smoker then one or two of these would definitely do you good for the night take a look I like that how they have like this imprinted on him mmm I ate the one that had there was like a TKO logo on one of them I think but I am pleasantly surprised by these like cuz when I've seen these for like a year and I just never wanted to decide to pick one up but I did not expect very much to the TKO I'm not the biggest fan of their carts but the edibles are far superior than their carts in my opinion everyone tried this one flavor I definitely plan on trying more and this video does good I'll probably review the other flavors too I have another review upcoming the next one is planned and then after that I might get grabbed like a nerd rope or something do that or the Nerds rope bites if anyone has seen those and try them let me know what you think um I would definitely grab these definitely be careful because they are potent [Music] reliable tasty potent and yeah hope you guys have a good day peace out", "Op1o3PsuG7U": "welcome back to the channel y'all in this video i'm gonna share with you guys something i picked up from city trends the war with some candidates some cannon for sale in there picked it up give it a try this is the sour punch sour patch some people call it whatever sour bite strawberry scrolls all right it's what the candy look like right here as you can see there so i said we're gonna give it a try sour punch strawberry bites all right so let's get into the review all right see what it tastes like it does taste pretty good another thing they own 11 grams of sugar so that's pretty good i'll show you guys will look like they mingle together like that okay okay taste like sour then it's sweetened up a bit that's super good they're super good i actually bought two bags there was a dollar as you can see here which i thought was pretty good i actually like them they're pretty good um you got a lot of strawberry flavor sour taste it's just super good now if i had a raider on a scale of one through five i can get either five these are super good i like where it tastes a lot of the strawberry you know i like how it gets like sour you know saying come from sour to come from sour to sweet or vice versa from sweet to sour you know spice

give this one a try sour bites strawberry flavor and until next time i'm gonna hit y'all on the next video i'm out peace", "3y4TTMbD2tI": "okay so the last time I was sitting here face to face with you guys I was talking about Coco dogs do you guys remember what that stuff was that was a weird chocolate like candy that kind of looked like actual little green dogs in a glass jar if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll have the link right up here in the top right kind of give you up to speed but I need you more recently I actually got something else in the mail and I want to talk to you guys about that because other than the coconuts which are actual candy this stuff you're getting that camera guy this is just CBD stuff and I actually have another packaging tube that helps matter of fact the company of this the acronyms in the name so look at that so this stuff is actual CBD infused gummy candy and unlike the last stuff that I talked about that this stuffs are actually kind of real it's not it's not just like 100% candy chocolate that's made to look like you know a green ugh the stuff in this little plastic jars actually I mean if you want to want to get technical is somewhat of a psychoactive unlike um that that chocolate stuff that I talked about before so here's the funny and ironic part about all of this you know you look at these two things these two jars full of you know it looks like simple harmless can you buy it like the supermarket and you think about the last thing I talked about which was the coconut one looks like something that you could get arrested immediately for for just having a jar on your person whereas this this stuff right here looks like something that you could waltz into any preschool and you start handing them out to kids without anyone batting a single eyeball and that's the funny part about all of this like it's just the way look how innocent this stuff looks it's crazy it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because it will in the state of Florida you got to be 21 at least from from what I recall but actually by this stuff even though it's completely harmless so we got here is uh neon poppers and everyone's favorite sour gummy worms i realistically they both taste almost exactly alike it's just they're different shapes from the shapes and sizes you can I don't know if you're getting that camera move but there are a whole bunch of little smiley faces there don't worry it on ecstasy but before I begin guys I'd be remiss to not kind of show you some one of the basics that you need just in case you guys don't really understand is where it comes from well what it's actually all about so many of you probably know about the stuff but maybe this is your first time learning about stuff like what is it I've never heard of this before CBD is that like LSD is it gonna like make me see pink elephants and ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools so let me explain really quick just exactly kind of the gist about it is got my handy-dandy whiteboard here perfectly by the way before I begin I'm not a medical expert so don't take my advice as I'm some sort of doctor or something yeah I totally left that field I mean I know I have the Asian face and everything but don't be alarmed because I definitely left the medical field I left to pursue a YouTube career where I rake in around $13 a month honestly the age of 40 is right around the corner and I still have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life so for all you outgoing recent high school graduates that are kind of freaking out about the whole real world thing and have absolutely no idea what they want to do yet don't worry cuz my book - way worse so I'd say a majority of you guys watching this video are probably more familiar with THC not too much can be said about CVD like I said earlier and there's still a common misconception about this kind of stuff especially the top of gram of certain psychoactive effects THC as everyone knows is the most active ingredient in the Disco salad this is the stuff that gets you intoxicated or is in simpler terms hi as I'm gonna do my best to try to avoid super confusing medical top of big science Awards because trust me there was a whole rabbit hole science terminology that this can all really boil down to alright so let's try to understand just exactly how THC you know gets you up there by the way before I begin try your best to not be offended by this little placemat behind here just in case you're one of those type of people basically everyone has in their bodies two types of cannabinoid receptors so let's just call these guys CB 1 and then CB 2 THC only binds to one type of cannabinoid receptor or CB so the cb1 receptors are usually found in the brain unlike the nervous system lungs liver and kidneys and the cb2 receptors are usually found somewhere in the union system there actually might be other CB receptors but that's totally not the topic here by now you probably can guess which of the two receptors THC binds to and that's actually this guy the cb1 receptor so THC see th see why not so THC is basically something that activates or stimulates that receptor and that causes like that cool rewarding effect or like that happy feeling that sometimes people get sometimes too much of it in some cases can get you was seeing like really weird like pink elephants magical dragons or like ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools and unfortunately for some people that cb1 receptor can be blocked and that euphoric feeling that many of groans so custom - just really doesn't work out for them but if you're one of the more majority lucky bunch then well Cheers now one like it's a brother ii cv receptor deals more with things like inflammation and pain management you know these can usually be found in like the gastrointestinal system and this is probably why CBD has a potential to help out people with like PTSD anxiety or other types of weird inflammation that goes on in the digestive tract or like around the body so okay let's break it down in a simpler example and this is lifted from green relief by the way they put it this way just imagine you consume cannabis and the THC and CBD are like a whole bunch of keys which are you know and searched for a lock to open those locks being the receptors these guys they click together with the proper key isn't different messages or scent you know all throughout your body so I'm like THC CBD doesn't exactly bind well with the cb1 receptor so really you kind of just almost don't really feel anything and if you really wanted to you have to take way more in the suggested limit but the worst thing that can honestly happen is like a slate rosiness or an insane state of calmness okay back to the talking Asian you really want to be careful with buying some of this stuff because a lot of the people that sell this kind of product aren't really will informing what exactly they're selling you so like last week before I actually got these things and you know the local vape store looking around for you know products that were similar the only reason I didn't is because the prices online are vastly different than what they are on stores they're actually kind of cheaper online to be honest and the stores are a little over there something like this and a store would probably cost you around 70 bucks online these things are like mid 50s or mid 60s so I walk into the store and I'm like you know I'm asking about him you know I'm asking about this type of stuff and I was asking like what's the whole thing about this almost immediately he just goes yeah bro stuff is totally worth the dude I'd like three or four of them and I was like totally gone in like five minutes dude I was I was I was surprised I was I didn't even know what to say you know before I even go in the store I kind of knew what the stuff was it wasn't well it's not exactly the most complicated thing to understand when he when he said he was gone he was like gone like with like 17 E's that's how gone there's this like his description was and I was you know I was taken aback I was no surprise you know so like three or four seconds after that there was like this like dead silence in the entire store and the only thing that I thought to myself was like dude I really hope this guy does not smoke weed because he's probably the first person that'll overdose on marijuana don't go into these stores thinking that you just found like an insane goldmine of like magical stuff because it's it's not it's not it's not that kind of stuff especially if you're in a state that still doesn't have fly solid recreationally illegal because it doesn't matter if you do that stuff and if CBD does get you like that I sure hope you don't take anything with THC unit so yeah this video is made way back in 2019 so I'm sure 10 years from now we can probably take a look at this kind of video and have a good laugh at it considering the fact like how strict the laws were on like you know this kind of stuff especially the ones regarding disco spinach because those right now even in states where it's legalized that's still federally illegal and it's classified as a schedule 1 drug okay so one of the part that probably wouldn't have you fast forwarded to the the actual product I was able consume a good amount of the bag well in the jar in the past 24 hours I didn't exactly read up on the recommended dose but I guess I should have since this was sort of a hefty sized jar at 300 milligram over 1000 1000 milligrams total so according to the little jar thing here it says that it's approximately 72 pieces you guys can read that there so thousand milligrams 72 pieces you do the math what's a thousand divided by 72 so you're looking about 14 milligrams per little candy thing well this guy this one's I think this I think there was a I think there's more gummy worms was there this had 142 pieces this is the smaller so if this stuff is still closed this has 72 gummy worms in here Oh this one had 148 smiley faces so 1000 divided by 148 okay so about 7 grams 7 milligrams of CBD and you show these little smiley face gummies usually the recommended daily doses I think it was between 15 to 25 milligrams for the stuff don't quote me on that I'm sure everyone's body chemistry is a lot different so in order to affect someone else it could vastly depend on like your size in your weight so my guess is the gummy worms here that have yet to be consumed will be a little bit stronger so I have to eat these in moderation because these guys on the other hand I kind of was just popping in like candy I forgot this was a CBD candy thing like I actually started eating them like as if there were something from like the candy aisle at Walgreens so you pop these in your mouth obviously consumer eager and they literally it's candy there's no hint of like you know when you have like the actual edible stuff from the other stuff you can get a taste of the good stuff this Kandee complete freaking candy so those a bit skeptical at first and how this helps with certain problems like anxiety and pain and you know while I didn't really have the laddering his idea was something that was pretty salient especially when driving around like the state of Florida some of you know me and the majority of my content in this channel is usually you know automotive related useless content right now while I've totally loved cars I absolutely despise driving on public roads that's that's a given fact I love cars but I hate driving and again I live in South Florida so this is kind of known as God's waiting room this is a place where older people move after they've realized that they're too old for other old people they hung out with but you know here's the thing it's not just the elderly which which are kind of terrible at driving a majority the people that drive here I feel like more than half of them have gotten their driver's license from a happy meal and because of this driving around in the state of Florida it kind of puts me on a weird edge the things I can definitely say that this stuff helps me out like like immensely I can't tell you how how much this stuff actually kind of works especially driving it gives me the nice reliable feeling that I'm not gonna get sideswiped by like a Corvette every 13 seconds anybody comes in a whole different types of forms you can get it as popcorn tinctures like something you can drop into say if you don't want any candy if you're someone that's trying to lose weight don't want to delve into the whole unhealthy candy eating process you got chips even got like CBD beef jerky and so they they put CBD and like act like a lot of things nowadays and I know this might be a totally unpopular opinion but I think edibles of anything is the most safest and best way to consume any type of whatever the help no matter what anyone says I think the whole inhalation of smoke and everything really messes with your whole body chemistry you know scarring of the tissue and the lungs and all that weird stuff so hopefully guys this was able to give you a sort of introduction of the whole alternative world of CBD let me know in the comments below it sure not only helped me but it helped anyone else that's trying to you know figure more stuff about figure out more stuff about this stuff other than that guys I got nothing else for you if you guys wanna help support my channel or visit my website it got merged stickers hats and other things literally out here calm and click everything yeah I don't I'm not a very good salesman I just had to say that at least the bare minimum I'll see you guys in the next video in the next vlog in the next whatever peace [Music]", "DiLc2xUQxWA": "[Music]", "VY8q0hN6KwA": "so I'm rich are tell on professor faculty member here at the University of Wisconsin huge candy signs so we make some heart candy today this is a mixture of granulated sugar you can see the white stuff here we have corn syrup in here as well and then we have water to help dissolve the sugar we're just gonna dissolve all the sugar and make sure that there are no sugar crystals in here because eventually we're gonna make heart candy which is a sugar glass so we don't want crystals so we've reached the boiling point now and so essentially we're gonna follow the boiling point elevation curve up so in making hard candy we're going to boil up to what's called the hard crack stage where temperatures are on the order of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and water contents are down around 2 or 3 percent so we're now at the 233 degrees fahrenheit range and and this is where we have the thread state and what that means is the viscosity is high higher that high enough that when you pour this into cold water it forms threads as it falls through there but the viscosity is still low enough that those threads dissolve fairly quickly so we're now at about 240 degrees and this is according to the candy thermometer where we find the firm ball state and so we boiled enough water that that when you pour this into when you drop it into cold water it forms a coherent mass that you can take out and form it into a ball that can still be manipulated so it's plastic enough to be malleable but it's still a firm ball I can hold its shape okay and we're at about 298 now and and so I'm going to stop it and take it off the heat so we're now going to take this over to the cold table and pour it out and start the next stage of the process so at this point we've poured it onto the cold table and it's starting to cool you can see that as it cools it becomes more plastic more firm we have some color granules and we'll add those in here some flavor so we're gonna add a little bit of lemon flavoring to this and then we're gonna add a little bit of acid as well so right now we're in the stage where it's becoming a plastic mass and we're just trying to get it into a shape that it will go through the rollers it still has enough heat in it and the viscosity is low enough that it starts to flow so far to form it now it would form but then it would quickly deform just like it's doing here so this is just about at the point where where we can form it it's viscous enough that it's not flowing very quickly yet it's still plastic if it enough that we're going to be able to get it through the the rollers and and turn it into a nice candy [Music] so as you can see we're sending this plastic mass through these drop rollers they fill into the shapes and make the drop shaped candy so now our lemon drops have solidified enough to reach room temperature where now they're in the form of a sugar glass so this is just like window glass except it's made of sugar molecules not of silica but now because it's in a sugar glass I can drop this onto the tray and it's going to shatter it'll shatter along the webbing here or leaving behind some intact lemon drops so at this point we have lemon drops but they have all these sharp edges on them still so the next step in the process would be to put them into some kind of tumbling drum to smooth out the edges [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

working a festival in Austin and it's still unclear why they were pulled over the way it was him initially what would be the reason to be pulled over they can't say the vehicle they never said that's the reason why the Mobile County District Attorney Ashley rich says all of the evidence has been sent for further testing at the Department of Forensic Sciences for more definitive results Muhammad insists they won't find anything it was gonna tap everything and make the charges be there until they said it says coming back from a different lab is all just inconvenience catalyst for my experience

6:00 I'm Steve Irvine and I'm Kim Tobin in for semi Hockridge tonight where did it come from it is the question goodyear police are asking tonight just over 24 hours since five students got sick from candy that may have contained marijuana while the police focus on that parents are asking how do you talk to your kids about this right ABC 15s Mike Pelton live in Encino schools in Goodyear and Mike how are we supposed to teach our kids what is safe when it actually looks just like candy yeah and even today goodyear police tell me it appears the candy involved in all of this was a gummy covered with sugar so today we talked with a local dispensary about how to tell the difference between edible marijuana and real candy headaches were the symptom marijuana candy possibly the cause so say good year police looking into where a student got it on Tuesday before giving it to four others a typical like Apple ring you know you name it it has all different types of forms we talked to Anthony Harrington the CEO with all greens dispensary which is not connected to the incident in Goodyear and even though it comes in a form of a candy it needs to be treated like medicine so it's on the patient to put it in a safe place based in Sun City Anthony says there's a big appetite for candy infused with THC the types of patients that we're seeing that are buying maybe a little more elderly or those who are just who can't smoke maybe it's too harsh for them when they're smoking according to state law when dealing with medical marijuana products need to come with a label and warning keep out of reach of children it appears some manufacturers put it in different places this one it's on the back on another a warning comes right up top you can see the clear a distinction of the medical marijuana plant Anthony tells me these bags of candy should never end up in the hands of kids to parents he says find a case and lock it up it's medicine you would not keep aspirin now you would not keep ibuprofen out if you have underage children who may who may who see it and may take it as candy you know it's the same type of thing now that dispensary holds weekly educational classes meanwhile back here in goodyear police they are still working to determine how and where the student got the candy we're live in Goodyear tonight Mike Pelton ABC 15 Arizona developing tonight the investigate", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe I hope you guys have a wonderful day", "njfnqSonUw8": "hi welcome to much makes it today I'll be showing you how I made Jolly Rancher James these are the supplies you're going to need a little goes a

for pancakes but non ice creams you know whatever you want to use syrup or we're going to be using our steamer pot we have in the description below we have a link to Amazon for the steamer pot this is awesome it does away with the jelly bags and that sort of thing what we do is three separate types the first pot is got water in it it has a little device here a little cutout for the second pot has this tubing on it and with the tubing you can let it let the juice out as it gets in the second pot right now the second pot is empty it has that the steam will come up through and it will land in this pot and we will let the juice off as it works right now we have strawberries in here so today we're making strawberry syrup we're going to put the lid on it and then we're going to monitor it because you never want this bottom pot to go out of run out of water you have to check it but it'll take in a while about 20-30 minutes we'll start checking it and we just monitor it keep water in the bottom pot and the middle pot you take off the juice if it gets to be too much and about our hour and 10-15 minutes we should have plenty of strawberry juice and then we'll start the strawberry syrup recipe okay when juice is coming through this pipe it usually means that there's about whatever level here is up here you don't want the juice to get way up here because your little tube in the center is only about this tall so we're going to drain is probably right in here we're going to drain some off and we've already checked the water there's still water in there alright then even string some of the juice out for me and it is looking really beautiful and smells like strawberry and this takes it all the work out of jelly bags and stuff like this I'll show you when we get through and what's the health of the strawberry it takes all the flavor out pretty much but you could use stuff if you were making something I guess them it takes all the color out most of the flavor out and you have nothing but just the flesh or the very little pull pull that's the beautiful red juice all right guys we've um and we finished um juicing our strawberries we've got this much got a little bit left in the pot here we're going to pour in there but uh we've got this and we're going to show you what it what they cook down to now now this is what the strawberries look like now they're not hardly anything left in there they are just about completely gone to nothing we're going to take this up I'll tell you just a little bit up learn to tilt it let's sit there for a second and I'll sit down see the pigs are going to love that then we have this little bit of juice left in the bottom here is not that much we're going on we don't want to waste none of it I'm going to take this and we'll come over here and just come on core it plus there's a little bit of drugs it's always gonna be left in a bottle so I'm always not put that one in there strawberries have little tiny seeds on there still a bit of water left in the bottle pot here which is okay that means we didn't run out of water we're getting really close to our time okay guys this is the strawberries is left over for the pigs as you can see there's nothing but really just look at a both left here we just scoop this up put it over in our looks lost bucket here in the house okay we have our 9 cups of strawberry juice and we added 9 cups of sugar we're going to bring this to a bowl and boil it until it starts getting sick hey guys this is what I'm looking for here we're cooking the syrup out let the kill it down just a little bit here so don't want to run over we're in the stage where the bubbles are like four inch to half inch bubbles that's what we're Walton now getting to be bigger when I get to be about 3/4 to 1 inch we've got some good sort of bacon when it gets to this stage you're usually around 225 degrees which is going to be real close to some syrup here let me kind of do a little bit of a check here we're getting real close y'all all right guys I've got a consistent tongue bubbles here you see a lot of them are popping up someone get to be about an inch in diameter when they come up 3/4 inch to an inch that's what we're looking forward to have what I call pancake syrup so we're going to probably pull this off now and go ahead and jar it up because I believe we're a good consistency for pancakes it's gonna fall now it'll fall back down there we go good consistency I believe for pancakes let me check it right quick or go too far let's just get yeah I think we're there alright guys we put a half a teaspoon of lemon juice in there with that we're labeling up our syrup here right there okay this is the last one that little bit is going to be mine for the fridge we've got one tap point and five

your friendly neighborhood negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help with making all these videos also if you're interested in supporting off of youtube make sure you check out our patreon page it's going to be linked in the description you get a lot of things for your pledges every month and it really does help make these videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so i hope that you found this video helpful before we get up out of here i do want to do today's subscriber spotlight

will do just fine of organic Jam try not to buy the jam that has preservatives in it and it can start cooking on my small burner hi geeks I'll be mixing all of this now this is the first time I'm using this Jam and it already is looking rather pale so I want more at this point then this is a good time to judge if you need more Jam or you don't need more Jam I'm having another 30 grams of jam [Music] so we have roughly 1/4 cups of jam there if you have little strawberries there they'll usually float like that try and break them down now it's not nice to have them they are great but you might want to make sure they release all their moisture during cooking and after all this is a candy not a jam so want to break these as much as possible already getting a lovely aroma we've reached 150 degrees Celsius I'm turning off the flame given against been good they're making sure it's homogeneous while we pouring the candy let's pour [Music] you can see we still have fruits there [Music] there we go [Music] her candy is ready you just have to cool a bit then we'll cut it let's try and cut it [Music] yes [Music] a cool night blade it's still very hot and the lines are emerging so I let it cool for another 20 seconds pass it over to another area that's cooler on the marble and then we can do it again I'm retracing my lines none of the candies a bit harder getting hard to cut it it's ready [Music] flip it [Music] then all we have to do is wait till to cool off and you can break it off the candies have cooled peel off the parchment paper and great thief [Music] [Applause] [Music]

hello food fans in the previous food video do they even will have a treat show you how to eat strawberries this is a one pound container of strawberries and these are huge strawberries I'll get to these one-pound containers and one is the regular strawberries the other is the organic strawberries and I don't really know if I could ever tell the difference in there you see if I can open this real fast and I'll show you how huge these strawberries are these are almost watermelon size so we'll get started on how to eat a strawberry but first of all I will do is I will wash the strawberries before I slice them to get ready to make any serving of strawberries and we might even use some secret ingredients so let's get started until we get to the secret ingredients the strawberry has a lot of nutritional values vitamin C has fiber yes potassium and it's loaded with antioxidants I'm just going to slice these up as I said these are big strawberries I'm going to you have only five of these strawberries and we need something to add to that what can we add to strawberries to make them taste just a teensy-weensy bit better I heard somebody shout shortcake Shortcake is good of course but angel food cake is a my secret ingredient that is even better than shortcake open this lid on the angel food cake angel food cake was priced at leave four dollars and twenty-nine cents see here turn this right side up four dollars twenty-nine cents so what I'm going to do is use a small amount of this probably I could get I could use 1/4 of it if I wanted to make a really big meal buzz use about 1/8 of this angel food cake here as a bed a cushion on which to lay these great big strawberries so they can get a rest on their bed this looks nice perhaps they're getting strawberries they have lots of nutrition and some angel food cake but there's more we will add more strawberries of course and I'll slice up all five strawberries here we have enough strawberries there to feed a large family or a small army I'm gonna put a little bit of powdered sugar on it here or secret ingredients but that's not all add something else I will sprinkle a few chocolate chips on this not really a lot just a couple of pennies worth perhaps and we will put something else on there as well put some pudding on there but I won't be using chocolate pudding since I've already got chocolate chips in there I will use the this is cafe oka pudding I will add this to the dessert now it has pudding on it we shall add two more secret ingredients before we begin to eat and enjoy and one of those secret ingredients some chocolate syrup this is a somewhat expensive dessert but if you're serving it to a lot of people it's not too costly per serving but if you eat like I do yes it comes in off this does make a good dessert very good tasting dessert for when you're having pizza spaghetti any kind of Italian food or fried chicken potatoes and biscuits that looks pretty good right there I'm gonna add one more thing and dig in in place of the pudding we could use ice cream or yogurt this is the whipped cream Milky presence is there something like ice cream it's also quite cold like ice cream doesn't that look good of course it does we're going to get started here and enjoy a dessert fit for a king and is a big scoop of good tasting dessert good yes this hits the spot great dessert very very tasty the chocolate chips add a lot to that I will go ahead and eat all of this at once Irving that's how you eat strawberries this is probably enough for four regular people after a meal such as slice a slice

could kind of be a little dangerous because I definitely don't really taste the weed in this which is really surprising I think it's because it's brownie but yeah it's definitely like a fudge more

I love chocolate and I am a huge fan of fudge and this is [ __ ] delicious like this could be very dangerous mmm dose it's the name of the company I can't double yeah definitely definitely really good

happen or absolute worst case scenario you completely trip oh and you ever the hospital like that is something we do not want to see and we do not advocate for here we want to see good slow medicating

tried to grab this you probably wouldn't even know how to open it like I actually took me if you mess be like okay how does this open because besides don't open just like literally rip it open from

guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it

it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the

delicious infused starbucks starburst drink i use all pink starbursts because those are my favorite and in canada we don't carry the all pink starburst packs you have to buy like the original one and then separate them out but that's okay i made mine pink starburst i think i used some red too and lemonade is such a good combination it's so good there's a whole tablespoon or just a little bit under a tablespoon of coconut oil in here and you can't taste it or feel it i thought it kind of would affect the texture and like the mouth feel and the taste and i can't notice it but it's so delicious i love it so much and if you guys like starburst flavor like how i do you should check out my diy infused starburst video which i'll post a link to in the description box below to make this delicious drink here's what you're going to need some starburst candy flavor of your choice infused coconut oil or tincture a flavor mix i'm doing iced tea and lemonade and then some additional lemon i just want to start off by saying my double boiler is not dirty prior to making this i made some infused starbursts and i'm just using the same double boiler so i don't waste anything at all and i'll post the link of how to make the infused starburst below this recipe is extremely flexible so you can just use whatever you think would be good portions for yourself i'm starting by adding about a third of a mason jar of water to a double boiler and then adding in five starburst candies you could add more you could add less five was good for me um if you added more it would be more flavorful and more sweet so if you don't want to use a drink mix and you want to just use the starburst you'll need probably closer to like 10 or 15. then we'll just leave it on the double boiler stirring occasionally it took about five or ten minutes for these to really start to melt so just keep stirring them until they fully dissolve which again like i said might take some time because they do need to melt and then you can add in your coconut oil i'm adding in about half a tablespoon you can do more or less depending on how strong you want to be surprisingly you couldn't taste the coconut oil i was worried it would be quite strong but the drink mixes and starburst flavor really took over an alcohol or glycerin based tincture would work well for this as well really any extract would work but i wanted to use coconut oil because that's going to be the most difficult to get to emulsify into this drink so you can see i've been stirring and stirring and you can still see those little oil bubbles on the side so we'll need to emulsify that so it has a better consistency so i just took the double boiler off the heat and put my immersion blender in the mixture which was a little bit tricky because um it's pretty shallow so i just added some more water so i could get my immersion blender submerged into the mixture if i was to do this again i would just add more water from the beginning the only difference is that if you have more water you'll need to put it in the fridge to get cold whereas if you use less water you could just pour it directly over ice and drink it right away now you can add your flavoring of choice for me for this one i'm using some lemon and i really love this powdered lemon because it tastes like real lemon and it's easy to always have on hand and then i'm also going to be adding um some crystal light lemonade and just mixing that in now everything's pretty much done i've tasted it and added some more lemon to my liking and then i'm just going to put it in a mason jar and put it in the fridge and as i put it into a mason jar i realized this would probably be the better way to emulsify it because the immersion blender really gets in there so just a little tip don't be silly like i was and try to use your immersion blender in a shallow dish when you could just do it in a large mason jar now i'm just going to throw it in the fridge to get it nice and chilly now that it's nice and cold from being in the fridge i'm going to shake it up and pour it over some ice the sweetness of the starburst mixed with the tanginess of the lemon and the lemonade is such a good combination and i really love it and the iced tea was good too but there was just something about that pink starburst lemonade that was just to die for too simple too delicious don't get any better i'm eating a starburst while drinking it that that actually does make a little better [Music] so good i feel like there's so many different combinations you can make with different flavors of starburst hope you guys try this out please let me know if you do if you like this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching [Music] you",

shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "Im7IMcoCDms": "\u266a\u266a Narrator: CANDIED FRUIT\nAND FRUIT JELLIES ARE MIDDLE EASTERN IN ORIGIN AND SPREAD TO EUROPE\nAROUND THE 12th CENTURY. THIS REGION OF FRANCE\nHAS BEEN PRODUCING THEM SINCE THE 15th CENTURY. WHEN WARS BLOCKED ACCESS\nTO CANE SUGAR, FRUIT FARMERS BEGAN\nPLANTING SUGAR BEETS TO PRESERVE THIS\nCONFECTIONERY TRADITION. THIS COMPANY IN FRANCE HAS BEEN\nCATERING TO PEOPLE'S SWEET TOOTH SINCE 1880 WITH ITS GIFT BOXES CONTAINING TRADITIONAL CANDIED\nFRUIT AND FRUIT JELLIES. TO MAKE CANDIED FRUIT, A MASTER\nCONFECTIONER BOILS FRESH FRUIT FOR MANY HOURS\nTO SOFTEN THE FIBERS. THIS PROCESS WILL LATER HELP\nSUGAR TO PENETRATE THE FRUIT. HE POKES THE FRUIT TO SEE\nIF IT'S READY. BOILING TIME VARIES\nFROM ONE HOUR FOR APRICOTS TO EIGHT HOURS FOR CHESTNUTS. CITRUS FRUITS ARE SLICED\nBEFORE BOILING. AFTER BOILING, THE MORE\nFRAGILE TYPES OF FRUIT, SUCH AS APRICOTS,\nPEARS AND CLEMENTINES, GO INTO LARGE HOT-AIR\nDEHYDRATORS FOR UP TO THREE WEEKS. EVERY DAY, THE MASTER\nCONFECTIONER REPLACES THE EVAPORATED WATER\nWITH SUGAR SYRUP, WHICH CONCENTRATES OVER TIME. FOR LESS FRAGILE FRUITS,\nTHE TECHNIQUE IS DIFFERENT. WORKERS HEAT THEM IN VATS OF\nSUGAR SYRUP FOR ABOUT 10 DAYS. THE MOISTURE EVAPORATES,\nAND THE SYRUP CONCENTRATES. THE FACTORY SELLS\nWHOLE CANDIED FRUITS LIKE THIS COLLECTION\nOF CLEMENTINES, APRICOTS, PEARS, FIGS,\nAND PLUMS, TO GOURMET FOOD SHOPS, WHICH SELL THEM BY THE PIECE\nOR IN ELEGANT, PRIVATE-LABEL GIFT BOXES. \u266a\u266a WHOLE CANDIED FRUIT\nARE ALSO POPULAR FOR DESIGNING\nEDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS. MAKING FRUIT JELLIES\nIS A DIFFERENT PROCESS. THE RECIPE COMBINES FRUIT PULP, MAKING UP MORE THAN\n50% OF THE MIXTURE, WITH POWDERED SUGAR,\nLIQUID GLUCOSE, A FORM OF PLANT SUGAR, PECTIN TO MAKE\nTHE MIX GELATINOUS, AND NATURAL FRUIT FLAVORING. A WORKER BOILS DOWN THE MIX\nFOR A HALF-HOUR TO CONCENTRATE THE SUGAR, THEN ADDS MORE FRUIT FLAVORING. AS THE MIX CONTINUES TO COOK, SHE DRAWS SAMPLES TO MEASURE\nTHE SUGAR CONTENT. SHE DOES THIS UNTIL THE MIX HITS ITS TARGET\nCONCENTRATION OF 78%. ANOTHER WORKER POURS\nTHE BATCH FROM THE POT INTO A LARGE PITCHER, THEN INTO A SQUARE\nSTAINLESS-STEEL MOLD. IT TAKES THE JELLY A DAY TO SET. ONCE SET, A WORKER REMOVES IT\nFROM THE MOLD -- THIS ONE'S\nA DIFFERENT FLAVOR -- AND COATS IT WITH CRYSTALLIZED\nSUGAR TO PRESERVE IT. THE WORKER THEN LAYS\nTHE JELLY SQUARE ON A CUTTER THE COMPANY CALLS A GUITAR BECAUSE ITS STEEL WIRES\nLOOK LIKE GUITAR STRINGS. THE WIRES CUT ONCE IN EACH\nDIRECTION TO MAKE CUBES. THEN, ANOTHER WORKER APPLIES\nA SECOND COATING OF SUGAR. IN ADDITION TO THIS\nSMALL-BATCH PRODUCTION, THE FACTORY\nHAS ONE AUTOMATED MACHINE, WHICH MAKES FRUIT JELLIES IN A VARIETY OF GEOMETRIC\nOR FRUIT SHAPES CREATED BY TEMPLATES\nMADE OF PLASTER. THIS PROCESS IS MUCH FASTER\nTHAN THE HANDMADE APPROACH. FIRST, THE MACHINE\nMAKES A BED OF STARCH. THEN IT PRESSES\nTHE PLASTER FORM INTO THE BED TO CREATE MOLD CAVITIES. \u266a\u266a THE NEXT STATION FILLS\nTHE CAVITIES WITH HOT LIQUID FRUIT JELLY. THEN, THE MOLDS\nARE SET ASIDE FOR A DAY. THE STARCH ABSORBS THE RESIDUAL\nMOISTURE AS THE JELLY SETS. THE NEXT DAY,\nWORKERS LOAD THE MOLDS ON TOP OF THE SAME MACHINE, WHICH FLIPS THEM TO DUMP OUT\nTHE JELLIES. THE JELLIES TUMBLE DOWN\nA VIBRATING CONVEYOR BELT. THE STARCH SHAKES OFF\nWITH EACH BOUNCE. THEN THEY PASS\nUNDER A SPINNING BRUSH, WHICH REMOVES\nANY REMAINING STARCH. THE CONVEYOR MOVES THEM\nINTO A ROTATING DRUM, WHICH SHOWERS THEM WITH SUGAR. ON THE PACKAGING LINE,\nA SLOW CONVEYOR BELT MOVES RETAIL BOXES\nIN FRONT OF A ROW OF WORKERS. EACH WORKER IS RESPONSIBLE\nFOR A SINGLE FLAVOR. WHILE PLACING THE REQUIRED\nNUMBER OF FRUIT JELLIES IN THE BOX, SHE ALSO PERFORMS\nA QUALITY CONTROL CHECK, REMOVING AND REPLACING\nANY THAT ARE MISSHAPEN. THIS ENSURES THAT THESE\nTRADITIONAL FRUIT JELLIES LOOK AS GOOD AS THEY TASTE.", "gwyTK2hK9pc": "hello everyone and welcome to making gummies 101 today I'm going to explain an easy and simple way of making homemade gummies if you dig this video please punch that like button and don't forget to subscribe for future and easy 101 cannabis videos today i'm gonna be using cannabis infused vegetable glycerin and we'll be doing this without using additional sugar however I will be using jello and that's basically pure sugar I do use my own homegrown and I will be making a separate video on how to make the glycerin so materials I'm gonna be using today are gonna be a pan a whisk a spatula some gummy molds and a syringe the ingredients I'm gonna be using is one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin 12 ounces of flavored gelatin of your choice so I'm using the cause of the blue raspberry jello yeah the blue raspberry jello one cup of fruit juice of your choice I use real apple juice I really like the taste of it and it makes it can really bring out the other flavors easy it's kind of a neutral flavor I don't recommend using citrus juices pineapple juice or orange juice nope two and a half ounces of unflavored gelatin I recommend knocks it's very sturdy keeps everything together it's it's pretty hardcore as far as gelatin scum a quarter cup of honey or agave syrup I use agave I recommend natural honey it can be a little difficult to mix but you know it's a lot healthier so either way is good and one tablespoon of tart and sour or citric acid powder in this case I use citric acid powder so I've started off by separating all my ingredients by my citric acid powder my Knox and my jello I'm gonna start by combining all of my gelatin together once they're in the same bowl I can give them a proper stirring okay that's looking good next we're going to be moving on to the agave syrup and the apple juice I've already added the agave syrup to the apple juice I'm just mixing them together now once they are mixed I'm going to add them to the bowl of gelatin powder now I want to whisk this gently I have to make sure it's mixed properly so I don't have clumps of sugar stuck together and you know in the end ruining some of my gummies once it's finished put it to one side and let it bloom while this is happening I'm gonna heat up my vegetable glycerin it'll take about an hour and a half and in that time the gel will starting to thicken so right here I have one cup of cannabis infused vegetable glycerin it's been on low for about an hour and a half it does take some time to heat up and start to smoke so just be patient don't let it smoke too much though or it will burn keep it low keep an eye on it and keep stirring it circularly every now and again with my molds lined up I'm ready to pour my jello into my vegetable glycerin since my jello has been sitting there for an hour and a half it's giving it time to solidify a little bit from here I can scrape it out of the bowl directly into the pan it's good to use a spatula for this part just to ensure you're not wasting anything and you get it all over the bowl at this point I'm going to use my whisk just to give it a nice gentle stirring it's okay if you want to turn the heat up a little bit at this point just to help melt the jello as long as you keep stirring it and afterwards you turn it back down again it's too high for too long you will burn you're just doing this to melt the jello once it looks thoroughly mixed in it's a good color and consistency to you grab your syringe as you can see I have assistance but it's okay if you're by yourself and you have to stop stirring to fill up your molds as long as in between filling your syringe you just give it a little stir give it a little stir so right here I'm basically just showing how I fill them up I'll edit this speed up the process but I try not to keep the syringe too high above because then it can create bubbles and your gummies and just visually it's not very pleasing that's all [Music] my personal favorites are the snowmen the very big you know I can use one syringe or I can use four syringes for me it's nice because it's a great way to control the dosage so I'm just gonna finish up these last little few right here make sure I finished with everything in the pan and then I'm just gonna pop them in the fridge give them a chance to cool down and get them all ready now for the final process I'm gonna keep them in the fridge for 8 to 16 hours usually the longer the better so they stay solid now that a few hours begun by I'm ready to take them out these those are my bears thanks to the Knox gelatin this should pop out righties look at that hey mister bear you look pretty solid I can actually identify what you are cool beans once that's done we can bag them and tag them so here's all my gummies in total not you shabby we got our festive snowflakes good our presence went mine done ripen one of those Halloween on Christmas we got our spiders we got our bats oh yeah and up here we have our snowmen well actually two sets of snowmen the badness to Frosty's you can see how thick those are my personal favorite and then there are smaller counterparts right there alright everyone so that's it thank you very much for coming by and checking out this video I hope you liked making gummies 101 don't forget to Like and subscribe for future videos and any comments or anything as well please feel free to drop them I'd be growing happy smoking happy eating", "059ZsVUl-3A": "hi and welcome to kena basics today we learn how to make rosin lozenges rosin lozenges are cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this

smoking weed so i thought about my life man [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome to my [ __ ] channel if you guys are new this is a great video for you guys to start with we are making as you guys seen from the title thc infused firecracker grapes i think they came out pretty good if you guys want to see them you have to stay tuned before we get this video started stop what you're doing make sure you subscribe make sure you turn on your post notifications so you're notified every single time another video like this uploads also just let me know down below if you guys want another video like this because i do have one other in mind and i think that i might just start doing cannabis infused foods and videos like that so let me know down below if that's something that you guys would like to see again without further ado let's get straight into the video but first it wouldn't be a video of mine if we weren't smoking all right all right all right welcome to my [ __ ] show and tell y'all okay so we're just gonna get the voiceover started bear with me i've never done a voiceover before but we're just going to hop straight into this so basically this part is optional we just wanted to take all the jolly ranchers out in one session so we could just throw them in the baggies that i'm about to put them in so that's what we're doing here damn okay so once you're done unwrapping all the jolly ranchers you want to throw them in a baggie if you don't have a food processor i'm just ratchet as [ __ ] and i didn't have a food processor so i decided to throw them in a baggie um double bag it triple back it and then use a hammer to basically hammer the hard candies down into a fine powder you really want the powder to be as fine as possible and have less bigger chunks of the jolly ranchers because it's a hard candy and it's not going to be really enjoyable to eat if there's really big hard crystals on the grapes yeah i'm saying it just doesn't make sense so crush those [ __ ] down make a little powder out of it or whatever now the powder is what it should look like those hard crystals i actually went back in and actually crushed them up finer here's the pot i'm gonna put half a cup of water half a cup of this cornstarch right here also sorry for the mess you know and just ignore that anyways so yeah so equal parts water and equal parts corn syrup and then you want to do two cups yes [ __ ] i know that's a lot of [ __ ] sugar two cups of sugar you want to mix that around i didn't turn the heat on until after so i can get all the ingredients in the pot and it won't start boiling i do recommend starting on like a medium heat and don't get into the hot heat yet here i am putting a lemon in the pot just because the recipe that i said the recipe that i listened to needs it said to put in some kind of citrus so i added this lemon here is the wax that i'm gonna put in each of these containers is 620 milligrams i believe and i basically put a little bit more than one and a half so it should be a pretty potent this is my regular ass broke ass thermometer your girl didn't buy no candy thermometer because [ __ ] it i was just gonna eye it so i was done with the thermometer it was not working now you see it start to boil it starts coming together you're gonna leave it boiling for a while i'm just mixing it up so it doesn't settle at the bottom and to make sure that all the sugar that's in the mixture is getting dissolved now you want to add some food coloring you want to add some food coloring when it hits about 250 to 260 degrees if you guys have a candy thermometer you don't need to stir the food coloring in because the bubbling itself is actually going to make the red color go throughout the pot you should see a red orange kind of color like this if you're doing it right [ __ ] if you're doing it right also you can use any food color you want damn [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] is taking so long my mom wanted to try a grape without the thc so that's just me digging my little fingers up in the syrup so i can get her grape before i add the wax into it god damn i'm taking another hit so here i'm scooping the wax out of the container and just throwing it straight into the pot you can use waxy i think you can use shatter i think you can use distillate honestly the mixture that is boiling is going to be so hot that is going to melt the wax just remember to use a dab tool to get all the wax out of there put it in the pot stir it around so it's mixed in there nice and good and it gets evenly distributed oh guess i have to cross it oh a little bit more oh oh that was a big chunk yep we're just stirring stirring stirring so because i don't have a candy thermometer you're supposed to be done at about 300 degrees you're supposed to let it start to cool a trick is if you don't have a candy thermometer get ice cold water and take some of the mixture and put it in the cold water and if it hardens then your candy is done this was difficult for me i think i ended up messing up on this part so don't listen to your girlfriend go get yourself a candy thermometer i swear but it didn't turn out too bad so i actually turned the heat off which is why you're seeing the bubbles start to go down we are almost done with our [ __ ] firecracker grapes y'all so i just took a um a skewer you can find these like where you barbecue or anything like that um i poked the grape put it in the syrup and now i'm just dipping it all in the jolly ranchers you do like such the jolly rancher mixture might get hard just continuously mix it with like a fork um and you maybe want to do like two different bowls or something when you do the jolly ranchers because it does get really hard especially once the candy syrup gets within the jolly ranchers it was quite difficult but you manage you manage you'll get there so just get a lot of syrup on there and start throwing all the powder all over your grapes and it should stick they should taste very very yummy oh yeah also you guys see the napkin because when you take the grapes and you wash the grapes you want to pat them dry before you take them you put them into the sugar mixture so that the sugar mixture sticks to the grapes that is very very important they will stick to the grapes without you doing it but it's gonna stick a whole lot better if you just dry them off first damn look how [ __ ] bomb these look i've been watching this like damn these look real good i better go in the house and have me some and that is it you guys thank you so much for watching this i can't wait to try these grapes and let you guys know how they tasted and if i got high or not i guess that's the question of the night since we did almost put i think we put about a thousand milligrams so we'll see how high they get us i will definitely let you guys know in the next video so make sure you subscribe make sure you hit the bell until you post notifications and i'll talk to you guys in the next one thank you for watching my video bye guys", "QHxhZ1_U4ns": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review show I only say that because I think I'm the only marijuana edible review show I'm sure if there was another one it would be the preeminent one because it's hard to have a worse one but what are we talking about here today other than how bad we are we are talking about gummies that's why I've got my Nutella and spatula here so that's what this is for this is for fat this is for fat for the real review the infused creation sativa strawberry apple sour melts strawberry apple sour melts what a weird combination don't even understand what the Apple is supposed to be in that strawberry Apple sour belts 300 milligrams of THC this will very likely be my final review of infused creations they've all been bummers from the get-go and if this one isn't doesn't pick up or it doesn't change my opinion in any way that will probably be it for infused creations and we can go ahead and write them up so I've got my fat here just with the gummies I like to ensure that I eat them under optimal conditions so I take a little bit of fat beforehand and I like to do that in the form of Nutella because I'm a red-blooded human being and I like Nutella like everyone who should creamy chocolate hazelnut evening delicious now for something a lot less creamy Nutella II and delicious this all of infused creations gummies we've got a strong whiff of it just as soon as I open that package have that very recognizable gummy weed aftertaste that very bitter a very astringent yeah makes you want to rub your tongue on sandpaper type of taste and I can already smell it coming out of these so I'm not looking forward to it this is smell strong boy does it smell strong I do like sour bells traditionally but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to like these anyways let's go ahead and put it right down the hatch let's stop bitching and complaining and just go ahead and eat it well oh my god that is terrible that is so bad oh [ __ ] me oh there's no like sweetness right on the get-go it's ah it gets worse just that awful awful awful aftertaste oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] these things are terrible but I'll do it for you guys so I'm gonna finish these off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part I don't we'll review actually in this case I'm pretty sure I haven't I'm gonna feel not high at all uh maybe the taste is the most important thing and the taste is [ __ ] sorry for such a bummer sorry to be sitting down and see you guys in two hours peace oh hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the strawberry apple sour belts from infused creations and they are terrible boy are they terrible they taste terrible I'm not high at all totally stone-cold sober I feel like I wasted my money on these total total waste of money thankfully not does not cost a lot for the infused creations I believe these only cost me nine dollars which is really affordable for a 300 milligram edible the only problem is I don't think there are 300 milligrams of THC in there because I am NOT high at all not even as I said I yeah yeah nothing to say about it nothing nothing kind to say about it if you see it at a dispensary near you pass totally avoid it actually go and tell your bud tender they should not be stocking these because it's just an insult to their customers sorry to get so real with you guys and sorry to get so real with you infused creations I wish I liked your products more I just think that they are garbage thank you so much for watching weeds guys I'm sorry it's been a

so for the first video of this year on amazing kitchen i'll be showing you how to make a very traditional candy or snack this candy has gone back about a thousand years in chinese history back to the song dynasty it is made of hawthorn berries if you've seen this before it is very healthy and tasty it's a little tarty and sweet in flavor but you most likely seen it in its modern form in the half flakes like this everyone has probably eaten this before in the past and this berry candy that i'm about to show you if you watch chinese soap opera the medieval type soap opera you've probably seen a guy holding a broomstick like structure that's walking down the street with these little skewers and these red little tiny balls sticking out of it it is called a ping tang or ping pong boulot that's the one that i'll be showing you how to make today it is a very healthy berry because it is very good for your cardiovascular system as well as it contains a lot of antioxidants so it's very good and it is a treat that you could probably give your kids you know if you're looking for something sweet to give them but not as uh or that is more healthy i would say because this contain a fruit all right well uh let's get into the video right away and let's see how it's made [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] ah [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm [Music] so that was the recipe what do you think did you like it i mean this is something very traditional it is very fun to make for your family and friends the most difficult part of this is the sugaring or tempering the sugar to get this crunchy i mean this time is very successful i tried it in the past and it was not successful but today is very crunchy i don't know if you can hit a crunch right now but i'm gonna bite into it right now it's very crispy and crunchy it's such a treat it holds so much history and culture and this simple little skewer of hot pork candies it's basically the fruit coated with some sugary candy and it's very fun to eat so it's a nice way to maybe if you if your kid cannot resist sweet at least you have some fruits in this candy treat all right well i think that's it uh for this recipe i hope you like it make sure you hit the bell button and subscribe if you haven't yet and share with your friends and family so who you think might be interested in this just show it to them who knows maybe they've never seen the real fruit before alright so we'll see you in the next episode take care stay safe bye now [Music] [Music] you", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can go back and you should have all the information if you have any questions for me please comment I

subscribe I will get back to you and as for now have a good day Cheers oh I don't know how to shut it off let's seal it like that", "SysslUhKwzE": "what is going on my peeps my name is David welcome back to this week's video god dammit my damn video now if you guys remember a few weeks ago when I made you this promise so it's gonna be between two to four plus videos per week yeah if you've been around here for any extended period of time you will know that I am NOT great at keeping the promises that I make sometimes although this one still has hope I'm just you know giving you a fair warning if I don't get two to four of this week but anyway some of you may remember that a long ways back I made jello Legos with these molds which did take me a couple of tries but they ended up looking okay and today I figured I should try to get more than one usage out of these $23 Lego molds I decided to take some inspiration from a tipsy bartender and all the other channels that have been doing shot glasses made out of Jolly Ranchers recently and use that same concept to make these Legos instead now there's a couple different ways that I'm considering doing these one of which I am assuming is going to come out the best but I will try a few so let's get right into it now if you are if you are out there that is more intelligent than the YouTube algorithm meaning that you have at least one brain cell and you make any amount of sense at all you would be able to assume that we need a whole lot of Jolly Ranchers for this project if this video gets taken down by YouTube you all know why but what I decided to do was to tump out the entire bag and to separate each of the five colors into their corresponding bulbs while also unwrapping each individual candy piece and this step is just about as fun as this time-lapse looks but once you complete that we can move on to the first method that I will be attempting and that is the double boiler method I've seen people melt down different types of hard candy like this before which is why I think that this might work so I've started with a few of the cherry flavoured because I tended to have the most of those and get even a while to melt down in the bulb and if you guessed that this was going to be a thick sticky mess than you were absolutely correct every single utensil I tried to use to stir this just did not work and got stuck everywhere the candy never really melts down completely to a liquid form it just stays really thick and the second you take it off the heat it thickens up even more so I tried my best to put the mixture in one of the little molds and let it cool down which as you can imagine was also at a C and a half but I guess when I took it out of the fridge it kind of worked a little bit but I think we can do a lot better for method number two all I did was stuffed each mold with different colors of the Jolly Ranchers I used four in each of these blocks which I'm hoping won't be too much or too little and once I had one of those molds completely filled I threw it in a 400 degree oven for about seven to eight minutes that's it for you if you're gonna try to make these things if you see a ton of bubbles in the top of the candy that means your oven is too hot or you left them in for too long but all you really have to do is just go in and try to pop them with a toothpick or a different sharp object just a little bit of extra work so avoid it is possibly but once I had done that that into the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes until it hardened up and these look a ton better they still didn't take perfect shape of the molds they really didn't get all the divots in it and you can kind of see the crevice where all the candy is kind of melted together so I made one more batch like that and they came out just about the same the last thing I want to try with these though is to do the same method but halfway through the baking process put another different mold on top so that way the divots from the top mold will hopefully melt down into the candy so you can stack them together I did a few batches with that method and they came out even better than the last one so I tried to build some stuff with them I tried to make a nice little candy staircase and I guess that came out pretty cool I tried to make a YouTube logo which came out pretty crappy if you ask me honestly and lastly I tried to build a wall with an accurate representation of the theoretical integrity of Donald Trump's [Applause] one last piece of advice I do not recommend being overly aggressive with these or dropping them from any sort of height because they're kind of fragile and will chip a lot being that they're hardened candies they're actually almost on par with being just as fragile as a drama channel's YouTube career but I hope you enjoyed this week's DIY if you did let me know by hitting the like button on this video and comment if you saw any other DIYs that you'd like to see me try

right you", "dmFGGXRKRac": "[Music] and delight edibles thank you for joining me my name is Liz and today we are gonna be making chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "6ahXm6eeME8": "[Music] hi welcome to diving delight edibles my name is liz's this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back sorry I was on a little bit of a hiatus there I was in the process of moving so I'm actually in a nice kitchen now with a real stove and real oven and I'm excited to bring in tons more recipes for you so today I thought we would do some English butter toffee covered with chocolate and nuts and it's a great recipe because it uses a cup of butter so therefore you can use either a quarter cup of can of butter 1/2 a cup of can of butter 3/4 cup of canned butter depending on how strong you want to make it now generally I use quarter can butter for most of my recipes it tends to be a very good quantity everybody is very satisfied with all of my animals so that's generally what I stick to plus you get more the natural flavor of having more of a natural butter the regular butter so I tend to like to do 1/4 butter 1/4 cup of can of butter for it and 3/4 regular butter but I'll get into all the ingredients and everything and we'll get started alright so for our can of butter toffee what we're gonna need is 1 cup of sugar 3/4 of a cup of regular butter you can use salted butter or unsalted up to you if you're gonna use unsalted butter then you're gonna want to add 1/4 teaspoon of salt if you're going to use salted butter then don't add in the extra salt you're gonna want a quarter teaspoon or sorry a quarter cup of cannabutter and now here's where you can switch it up so if you want to go want to make them a lot stronger you can go 1/2 a cup of can of butter to half a cup of regular butter either way it's gonna be 1 cup of butter however you want to split that up is totally up to you and we're gonna need a quarter cup of water and then 200 grams or two of those large chocolate bars of your favorite type of chocolate whether you like milk or dark and a quarter cup or so of chopped up walnuts or pecans or peanuts or whatever your favorite that is I'm going to be doing walnut they're equipment you're going to need a heavy bottom so that you have even heat distribution and a wooden spoon or a spatula and a parch lined cookie sheet pan and last but not least a candy thermometer and we're gonna get all these ingredients put together and get some toffee made all right so there's a pot we are going to add our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of canna butter and our 3/4 cup of regular butter I'm using salted butter so I'm not going to add 1/4 teaspoon of salt if you are using unsalted butter add 1/4 teaspoon of salt get that in and we're gonna add in our quarter cup of water turn the heat on to medium and you're gonna stir this until it begins to boil and actually we're going to continue to stir this for the entire process so you're just gonna gently Mick at everything mixed together and as it starts to melt just be careful now we're about an hour before you're gonna start your recipe you want to fill another larger pot with cold water and put it in your freezer or if it's wintertime you can put it outside you want to have this like ice-cold water ready because we're gonna submerge the bottom of the pot in to stop the cooking process otherwise it continues to cook and we want to stop it at a specific temperature and you also want to have your parts lined cookie sheet right close at hand as well and when you're stirring always make sure to go right around the edges because the sugar likes to settle into the edges of the pot so you want to make sure to always clear your edges every once in a while and just continue stirring through the whole process now classic coffee English toffee is a hard toffee which we would click this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit but if you like a softer toffee more the chewy toffee then you're only gonna want to cook it to firm ball or hardball state firm ball is 250 degrees hardball so it's gonna be very firm but it's still gonna be chewy hardball is 250 if you want that texture like you know that toffee bar in the store and then that is that soft crack which is 280 so if you want that it's still cracks but then it does it warms up it chews you want to cook it to 280 and if you want the full crack crunch candy then you're gonna go to 300 so that's totally optional on what you want to do I'm gonna be doing this to the hard crack the 300 and once your mixture starts bubbling like so we're gonna attach our candy thermometer and then you're gonna stir until you get to your desired temperature as I said I'm gonna cook mine to 300 the attach your thermometer and then you're just going to continue to stir it through until you get as I said to your desired temperature and it's very important not to stop stirring because your butter and sugar will burn very quickly eze keep stirring and stirring put some tunes on the background and enjoy some music dance while you're doing it unfortunately I can't you have any background kind of music here because in otherwise you can't monetize cuz oh god forbid I get or in thirty four sets off the billionaire's but anyway so you can just get to hear me chitter-chatter as you can see is it's getting up to temperature the texture changes gets a lot thicker and more toppy looking I had an issue with my candy thermometer it kind of blew apart on me there so I'm having issues because I can't get this one to hold on on its own I'm trying to stir and hold the thermometer at the same time I'm not that coordinated come on just a couple more degrees and then three awesome so then as soon as you're getting temperature you want to submerse it into your cold water so it stops the cooking process right away keep your candy thermometer in to make sure it's coming down and as soon as the temperature starts coming down you're gonna pour it onto your on to the cookie sheet there's my dog now this stuff's like molten lava so be careful it's really really hot you're gonna let that set and while that's cooling we're now gonna microwave or heat up our chocolate you can either heat it up on a double boiler to melt it over a double boiler or do it in the microwave I do it 30 seconds and 20 seconds 15 seconds and 10 seconds and then continue at 10 seconds until you're fully melted all right so once your chocolate is all melted you're just gonna take it and pour it right over top of your still warm toffee you want to spread it out nice and evenly if you have an offset spatula it makes it much easier you're just gonna smooth that all out and then just sprinkle on your choice of cuts so as I said I'm just using walnut walnuts you just can easily sprinkle them over the top and that's it you're gonna leave it sit for one to two hours once it's completely set and then we'll show you how to break it apart so our top is done I let it sit for about two hours and I put it in the fridge for about 20 minutes just so the chocolate would fully set and then what you do is just take it flip her over and then I just use a pizza cutter you can use or you can just hammer it but you just cut through just make your cuts oops or you can just use a knife and break it into the size pieces that you want well then you can just cut tip and take your pieces and just display it put them on a plate or you can store them in an airtight container and this should last about two weeks in an airtight container you should be good for and that's it I'm just gonna give this a try and then come back and say goodbye alright so here we have our English toffee covered in chocolate and it is absolutely yummy I tried it but I'm not eating on camera so no no and I hope you give it a try it's absolutely wonderful your friends and family will absolutely love it and if you have any questions at all obviously you can put them in the comments I will always get back to you and don't think there's anything else more I have to go over and I hope you try it let me know what you think about it and thanks for joining have a great

boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone", "GwF_MpmPQAw": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "RVko6dbsfYs": "alright so you can take this and put it in that look through this off we should boil in my crazy and I mean that's what you get when you put it in the freezer or the fridge till it hardens up oh I'm doing my home I had another dream for mommy's don't get along pray don't think they're too extreme but I'm really trying to go L took your wares medium rare are we read about with the pegasi worried about what the [ __ ] I be spinning in worried about who the [ __ ] I beach you", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "gFSm3tGZQgA": "hello iris Oh SOS here and today we've got some cannabis infused chuckles and some stoner patch dummies that have already opened people because more missus does my brain in and once not texturing but that's not over here nor there so let's have a look and so it's time to patch dummies I've opened up the red one and we've had a nice little looking side of it the textures absolutely bang bang swangs Wang you can taste the weed edits injuria but there's a real real strong taste of sweet sugary and then a kick of where these are very very nice one for you one for me I must admit these are very very nice next ones chuckled infuse gummy worms my mouth is watering to know that the oil want it though would you reckon they're just injected it or what or make them sour patch Tommy's oh wow I just finished to them mouth watering whoa let's have a look at these worms are saying then very tough taste better than the stone the patch dummies oh they're the winners involved at the choice at least two or go for chuckles the taste is more souvent and less explosive but if you do like your tangy bangbang and go for the sour patch Tommy's pleased our people I hope you enjoyed", "3XrKXtWPQW4": "you guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are mmmmmm like smooth it's so much just like melting your novel it's amazing hey guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to replicate and infuse my favorite chocolate bar from Purdy's I don't know if there's a party's in the States but in Canada we have lots of them and they have really good chocolate and they make this amazing chocolate bar that's white chocolate with sprinkles and pop rocks and is so good it is like the best ever only difference is that ours is going to be infused with coconut oil here's what you're going to need white chocolate sprinkles pop rocks and the most important ingredient coconut oil so this is the mold I'm gonna use for my chocolate bars and I'm not sure how much chocolate I'm going to need to melt so I'm just gonna have put my little chocolate wafers in here to kind of like visualize approximately how many I'll need so I think that looks about good I might need a little bit more a little bit less so we'll find out but I just don't want to melt too many if I don't need to since this is the only mold I have for a little chocolate cute little chocolate bars so I'm just gonna put the chocolate into my Pyrex measuring cup but a bowl or anything is fine I'm just shooting to use the pirate so that I can pour it out after so I'm gonna put this in the microwave for about 45 seconds so 45 seconds is third melting a bit ruin and stir it we don't want to over melt the chocolate or it will get like chunky so you just have to melt it slowly and then stir it melt a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in for 20 seconds that was 20 more seconds and it is perfectly melted now and then we're going to add in two tablespoons of our coconut oil so my coconut oil is just that partly room-temperature partly melted it would be best if I had this sitting on the thread shows fully melted that way I could put it into the the chocolate a little bit easier and measure it out but I just scooped it I was fine too now I shouldn't have to microwave this again because the heat from the chocolate should melt the quill but I might not do it we'll find out just keep stirring it a bit to just warm it up and melt it so I think it keeps me melted a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in the microwave for like ten seconds and I do want to make some of my chocolate bars Oreo so I'm gonna have like a mix so I'm just gonna bring up some Oreos and add them to some of the moulds okay there is our ten seconds and you can still see little coconut chunks but I'm just kind of stirring them in and pressing my spoon against them to melt them there's still a little bit of Trump so I'm just let this sit here and melt a bit more while I put my Oreos into my bowls just gonna break them up and put them right into the mold I think that I don't know like should I do them with Oreos and sprinkles like these ones over here all gonna be the sprinkle and pop rock ones but these two I want to be Oreo but it just like should I also have sprinkles I don't know okay we'll save that to add on top okay so that those little chunks have melted a bit you can mix that in and I feel like we're probably gonna need a little more chocolate like that doesn't look like enough for all these but before I add in my sprinkles and my pop rocks I'm just gonna fill up the Oreo ones now maybe a little bit more Oreo on top I'll crush these ones a little bit finer those look good it's like cookies and cream I wish I would have crush the other ones this small kind of looks a little bit better mmm it smells like cookies and cream okay now for the other ones that I'm gonna do top rocks and sprinkles I could mix it directly in here and then pour it in but I kind of want to pour it in and then add it so we'll see how this goes I think I'm gonna have to make more anyway and obviously you can use any fillings you want like you could add any sort of like cookies you could add mint flavoring you could do like marshmallows oh you can do anything you want okay I do need a melt a little more this will just be like a mini one maybe just like those like Hershey bars you get a Halloween okay now I'm gonna add the pop rocks cotton candy how good is that gonna be with this is anybody else is just like love cotton candy flavored things like what do you have flavor is cotton candy I just feel like it's sweet flavor okay it's open these up let's see what color they are okay so they're pink I would have liked it they weren't pink to be honest because like I really want to see them but they might blend damn with the sprinkles so we should probably be fine today I'm just gonna kind of like mix them in like how much do we want it there you'll see a man sprinkles now sprinkles are the best part I like lots of Franco I like the crunch of them in there and we're just gonna mix them in again my god this looks so good so I filled up my molds with chocolate and put my toppings in them and then I'm just gonna put them in the fridge for like I don't know 20 minutes 30 minutes we'll find out how long it takes alright guys they've been in the fridge for about half an hour and they are ready to come out so we're just going to pop them on out of their molds but we're gonna do it gently so we don't break the chocolate while it's coming up guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are okay the best part tasting them ah mm-hmm-hmm oh we have the extra sprinkles hmm yes oh these are so good they're almost better than the one from Perry which is weird cause like I use pretty cheap chocolate but I'm thinking the coconut oil being added like smooth it so much just like melt in your mouth is amazing thank you guys so much for watching please

few traditional recipes that I really have to make each year it won't be their same during the all of these if I don't make them they are a couple though they require specific ingredients and because I want to make sure that they are fresh I simply make my own in today's episode I'll show you how to mimic my candied fruits this recipe is so easy you can use any fruits you want the beauty of making your own is you really know it's fresh and it makes such a big difference in your baking goods so my friends let's get cooking the first candied fruits we'll be making are the citrus peels so we'll take any of them and slice just through the peel from the top to the bottom and then we'll simply cut into quarters just like this which will make it much easier to peel yes the peels are too wide but what we'll have to do next is to slice each of them in small strips or whichever size you like next we'll place the peels in a pot and we'll pour enough cold water to cover and what we'll do is to bring to a boil then we'll remove from the heat and drain in a colander when our drain will transfer them back to the pot and we start all over again cover with cold water bring to a boil and drain we'll do this process four times all together and why are we doing that it's to remove the bitterness from the peel by blanching them it tenderizes the pill when they cook in simple syrup so after we're done with blanching will return the pills to the pot and add water and sugar we'll stir until the sugar is dissolved and simmer on medium heat for 45 minutes stirring occasionally later on they should look like this barely any liquid so we'll remove the pot from the heat and using a slotted spoon will transfer the pills to a wire rack well let them cool and dry off a little for 4 to 5 hours all right so now in batches will transfer the peels into a large bowl and pour a little bit of sugar over just enough to cover them on both sides we'll either shake them or stir them which ever way you feel comfortable with and place them on a baking sheet line with our circle map or parchment paper works as well this time we'll let them dry completely overnight before storing them in an airtight container and a recruit that we like to use in baking is pineapple but this time the method is slightly different so in a pot over medium heat we'll add sugar and cold water we'll stir until the sugar is completely dissolved and bring to a boil before adding the sliced pineapple well cook them for 45 minutes but every 15 minutes though we'll flip them over when they're done we'll transfer the slices on a wire rack and let them sit for 24 hours the next day we'll place them in a bowl and sprinkle with a little bit of sugar by the way they won't be dry yet so stirring is probably the easiest way to coat them well transfer them on a rack for another 24 hours now if you're still sticky the next day repeat the same steps by sprinkling more sugar on and back on a wire rack for Emma today here's another popper baking ingredient to candy and it's ginger so in a pot over medium heat well combined ginger cold water and granulated sugar we'll stir until the sugar is completely dissolved well bring it to a boil reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes when it's done we'll remove from the heat and scoop them out onto a wire rack to cool and dry off for a couple hours like the other fruits will transfer in a bowl and coat with sugar and my friends this is how to make candied fruits extremely easy to make this is a great recipe for any Baker to keep around the flavor of these candied fruits is much better than the store-bought you can either fit these in chocolate or finely dice them for baking I hope you give it a try soon and be sure to visit Caputi comm frame 3 in a month and more info until next time my friends Bon Appetit [Music]", "IUjJvu_vaSE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "2l3xFaS8vOY": "I'm gonna get stoned first thing in the morning hi welcome to and anything show and today I'm going to show you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "5hsCZVvIsbU": "all right what's up everybody your main homie EDF India's bringing you guys a little review of wild edibles now these are a delicious way of consuming cannabis or the consistency to match so finding your perfect dosage is honestly really easy my favorite is about thirty milligrams or three pieces which I personally found was the perfect high before you start hitting that area where you start getting anxiety here and there you know ten milligrams was also a very comfortable micro dose amount it was a really easy high and you weren't really gone you were just chilling having a good time the packaging was a fun experience honestly I really had a good time just opening it up for twenty dollars for a hundred milligrams this is like your average price and honestly it's a really good flavor it's consistent and it's really potent which make it worth trying but it honestly is just another edible on the market there's nothing so special where it's like oh man I'm gonna keep coming back but honestly it really is a great product and I would do it again alright guys thanks for checking this out just like subscribe share do all that good stuff and I'm out [Music]", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "2JS-9o6KR3A": "Are you looking for a delicious sweet treat which is beautiful and easy to make? Ever since I was little my mom always served fresh-cut fruits as a dessert   instead of traditional pies and cakes. Every winter, my mom made Tanghulu for me It is one of my fondest memories Now, all desserts are good desserts but I still have a soft spot for Tanghulu That\u2019s why I would like to make this delicious Tanghulu recipe and share with you a little bit of my sweetest memories from my childhood This candied fruit snack, also referred to as hawthorn candy or candied haw works well with almost any fruit! I recommend candied strawberries, grapes, mandarins, blueberries, oranges, pineapples and kiwi.  My favorite is the candied strawberries recipe! So, today let's start from strawberries! I picked several most beautiful strawberries for you Don't use strawberries with scars.  Use strawberries that have a shiny outer surface instead. First Then remove the leafy part from the strawberries sometimes my mom did not remove it, she thought it was more beautiful with some green but I just enjoyed eating it in one bite, lol Pat dry with a paper towel and set them aside. Place the wooden skewers through the ends of the strawberries You can use up to three fruits per wooden skewer. Find a place with many small holes which could firm the skewer I was using this steamer you can also stick the skewers in the plastic foam  make sure the sugar : water is 2 : 1 First, boil syrup over medium heat. I set a timer to let you know the different status of the sugar Stir it up and bring it to a light boil. Be sure to stir constantly or the sugar can burn easily. When the sugar is all melted and the syrup starts to boil slightly thick, reduce it to low heat. When syrup starts to appear in clear golden colors, it boils up as sticky as starch syrup. Turn off the heat. Boil the sugar-water mixture for about 15-20 minutes\uff08the time varies depending on the gas stove pot specifications!\uff09 or until the candy reaches around 300 degrees F (150 degree C) If you don\u2019t have a candy thermometer, you can use this trick. Prepare a cup of ice water Take a spoon and dip it into the mixture.  Then, immediately dip the spoon into ice water. If the candy mixture hardens, it\u2019s ready. If it\u2019s still sticky, it needs to get hotter. Dip the strawberry skewer in the hot sugar water candied mixture and cover the entire strawberry.  Take the strawberry out for 1 second then dip again for an extra thick coating. The strawberries should harden immediately and can be enjoyed as soon as possible.  You can also store them in the refrigerator and serve cold.  Here is another trick I learned from my mom To make the strawberry visually stunning pour a spoon of sugar mixture around it, rotate the wooden skewer during the cooling of the mixture.       See, the mixture looks like a layer of crystal coating on the surface of the strawberry.  Have a bite, it's really flavorful! The left sugar is hardening, but no worries.  Let's use them to make caramel milk tea. Add 1 cup of hot water. Put the melting caramel into the tea bag. Here I would suggest use Ceylon tea. Half caramel black tea mixed with half milk. A cup of easy make and delicious caramel milk tea, here we go. Thank you for watching. On the next episode, I will bring you more kinds of Tanghulu.", "4G1GXjoUOHM": "which ones you want it's a little bit more I think that that's like the full effect just even like the bags loose on the way slowly yeah", "lC7spjFs2RY": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me Medical Mary and we're gonna have an RS snow day the first thing that you have to do is learn how to open one of these packages so there's usually place right up here where you squeeze it and boom there it is microscope packaging is a little different so when this is closed you have to pinch it and then squeeze it open so a lot of the irises are a little thicker and you don't want to break the packaging so I soaked them in a cup of hot water for about two minutes the Terrapin click cartridges can be a little tricky to open you have to pinch and pull and it's real easy because you just dial it up to pull it anything out so what do we put that stuff in a lot of people bake with it but I have a little trick package of starbursts take them flatten it out kind of like this you take the RSO you click out the amount that you want and you just put it on there and roll it up in a ball the Crisco dispensers are a little easier to use but harder to dose see you twist and pull on this and with the plunger you have to push out but not too much make sure you put the dose right in there put that right back on there and then that you have your starburst you roll that up into a ball and there's your nose from the road so that's my little trick on how to make one day with 2dos fine doses to carry with you why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was calling the cattle back that's my easy trick to make as many doses of RSO as you want and why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was the pot calling the cattle back you", "XwDbtYweiVk": "you're watching B TV welcome back to B TV a year ago this next company was number 12 in its category today they're number one by a wide margin in the cannabis edibles market in California the largest legal cannabis market in the world plus products makes gummies so how do you create such a successful brand and become a revenue generating company so quickly to find out we spoke with the company's two co-founders Justin crunchy Quinn and Jake hi mark we started in edibles because we thought that was the place where there's a lot of things that can go wrong and if you get them right what you've done is actually create a great brand however on the way to making gummies jaqen crunchy made cannabis gum with a little help from Jake's parents the only space that we could afford was his parents free garage so who we've moved there and we built a makeshift cleanroom for the first six months of the company it was basically R&D facility office manufacturing facility packaging facility it was everything gum eventually led to gummies with his knowledge of cooking from his career as a chef and his experience in the cannabis industry Crunchie was well aware of what it would take to make a great gummy these look really good cooking especially at a high level is the blend of art and science it's the ability to give people the experience that they want the experience that they didn't even know they wanted a lot of the infusion process is extremely scientific and the flavors and how we do special additions and how people feel about the products that's the artistry what we've done is taken gummies which can be a category where it's tossed into different bags or boxes that can sort of not be an attractive format and we've made them really small which was hard to do to make them precisely dosed and then put them in a really convenient when you turn the top off of the tin what you have is all of the gummies right there and their beauty and their deliciousness it's a really important part of the customer experience that has made us products so successful in California looking good and tasting great our only part of the equation one of the hardest things to do really well in a manufactured cannabis product is to get the dosing exactly right every time if a product is too strong people wind up in the couch and you never want to try the product again if the products too weak you don't move it on and so getting that balance really between the two is the most essential thing to the customer and having the right selection of flavors has definitely helped win over customers we look at what people are enjoying in other parts of the market not just gummies just you know flavor trends things that people are really into now with the special editions we look at the short term trends and also things that we've never seen before that we know that we can actually execute so we do both seasonal and we do things based around holidays because you're selling an experience it's tapping into the desires of people around specific times and what about tapping into markets beyond California as more and more states legalize it's really important to think through what's going to make a successful national brand a plus we do one thing to make manufactured cannabis products and it puts us in a unique position to actually do that same thing in every state and in other countries in a way that is simple for customers it's simple for partners our ingredient suppliers understand it and the focus of the company is all line on one goal which is making really great products but with mainstream success comes responsibility I think there's an opportunity for the entire cannabis industry to actually bring us from where we are today to be a more mature responsible and adult this tree if you look at the alcohol industry they put a lot of time and effort to make sure that drunk driving wasn't something that people wanted to do at plus we hope to be a leader in those companies who are helping others to understand the benefits but also some of the potential downsides of cannabis we think all cannabis companies should do the same we work every day to make products that we like to say would make our grandmothers proud there's a lot of heart and soul that goes into every single product that comes about out of our factory and that's why in every package it says made with love in California plus products has recently launched mints and with the acquisition of good co-op will be selling baked goods also made with love [Music]", "RK1U4ouIDuo": "hello hello hello okay welcome back to another tutorial in this video we're gonna be doing candy strawberries I have been getting a lot of inbox

out of pineapples and the Jolly Rancher strawberries and those Oh pink lemonade go over everything again cause like I said I'm bad with putting things in this works I'm box you know just pretty funny and whatever okay you got to eat so much keeping them in a country time weeks you're gonna need strawberries pineapple whatever fruit that's your own dipping you're gonna need yeah flavoring you don't have to use flavoring oh you don't have to use this this is optional just like the white is optional this is only to get the color the desire color that you want if you don't use white it's going to be like a transparent color like a see-through in other words that's why you want to use white and you can order this on Amazon and you can order this from Amazon but I order straight from the source itself Loraine oils are you can find it at Walmart they have to lecture in ohms these are the things well it comes with a pack I love this together so this thing come from Walmart but Walmart also sells these they come suits or pack you need your flavoring of choice you don't have to use it like I said it's optional your white is also optional you need your strawberries your pineapples let's go over the mix three cups sugar 1 cup Cairo 1/2 cup water that's 3 cup sugar 1 cup can roll cup water you're gonna mix it right in surfboards about 290 300 take it off if you add in your flavor and your flavor if you add your wife and your wife didn't add the desired color that you're gonna use I use pink you can also get this online I don't normally use this only to color fondant but you can use them for candy candy apples and stuff like that I just don't like because it always be stakes in ions so of course tolerance you're gonna crush the dollar interest you're gonna make sure sugar like I did in the video and that's about it so I hope y'all guys enjoy this tutorial if you did don't forget to Like subscribe and your thumbs up leave all comments in the comment section below and I'll be sure to ask for if I can and when I can and my phone where you shop steak let's have a wonderful day and the next til the next tutorial bye okay now this is the finished product pink lemonade and Jolly Rancher that is it you", "X4iquNQgpJg": "[Music] so here I have the grapes I have them soaking in some cold water and vinegar and then I'm going to let them soak for a few and rinse them off and boom Gill has some cream so I never seen anybody do these grapes before with like sprees or nerds so I want to try something different so I have those candies as well as Charlie Ranchers and warheads and then we have sugar and corn syrup and you're going to also need water so you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of sugar 1/4 a cup of corn syrup and 1/4 a cup of water so you want your mister to get to a good boiling point like a rolling boil when it starts to slow down that's when you want to pay attention well you want to be paying attention majority of time but when you hear it slowing down that's definitely when you need to pay attention you want sure mister to get to about two hundred and ninety degrees so at this point I'm going to chop down my candy basically granulate my candy I'm gonna do that with three other sets of candies I'm gonna leave the nurse alone because they're pretty much smaller and that's where we're gonna continue to do and we're almost done so definitely look at it to make sure it's the consistency that you wanted here I had to end up grinding it some more it's to get it to consistency than I want it and there you go so I am not washing it in between uses because if I was to wet this it would be a complete waste and all the candy would be stuck now at this point we are adding in the goods the flavor so I use tropical punch they see me adding in my white gel color and then I am going to add in my blue out of my white first this so it can make my secondary color very vibrant all right so now we're ready to dip so I have all that candy to the side up right I'm gonna take that skewer with the grape on it put it in roll it and roll it in the candy and it's just that simple ladies [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so at this point I needed Siri Mount Mike and email me not candy melt but my candy concoction and Here I am at a better angle so you guys can see me a lot clearer so here I am I'm pushing down they came to solution down so that edged up the pot so I'm going to take this great as I said I already had them prepared on the skewers it's going to take to secure dip it in the candy and roll it sometimes the great soil falls all you have to do is take your skewer or your toothpick press the bank don't press it all the way through irelia my god previously said I like to cover half of the great if you would like to cover your full grade you can all right now I'm just gonna take it and roll it and a candy I don't wanna Simon gonna take the off the squirt that's a little problem came here but you can pull up and we do have those no problem Oh drier very quickly miss pulled off so I'm going to pull this off the skewer and then I'm just gonna cover that all in it candy look at that [Music] [Music] so here I was getting a little paper towel off my grade and I'm gonna dip it it don't do what I'm doing here I don't want you guys to bring yourself I've been doing this for years and I know I can get a better better handle of the grain by doing it like that but please don't do this if it's your first time LT KB or making candy give yourself a raise [Music] that I uses we're an oil strap of much flavor she also has other flavors in make sure you guys click that like button subscribe comment and keep on following I got work [Music]", "i3oUc6F0rUw": "[Music] hey guys this is Leon and you have reached the vibe tribe today we are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "Rm2vhbDX5_Q": "so here are my strawberries i'm like an ankle maybe and a flower this one isn't looking too well i'm hoping it'll make it you're just growing that wasn't there like a week ago but i'm just hoping it'll come back if it doesn't that's fine here is like a fruit that set like i think like a week ago and this one also set like a week ago and this flower is just opening this one set like two weeks ago and you can see the strawberry is already developing this one doesn't have any flowers this one i think the flower got trapped in there so i don't know and i think it'll just grow by itself yeah there's a whole entire bunch of flowers coming up but they haven't bloomed yet i've noticed that even on the flower branches i mean they're like the flower bunches they're still like little tiny mini leaves like that you can see not this one this one it's also connected to the flower stem and there's like four flowers on this one i think there's on this brunch there's like um four also this one has i can only see three but there might be four blocks and here's another fruit that set um two weeks ago and it's looking like my best one you can see the seeds are really starting to show and i'm hoping that this one will grow and ripen up soon here on this bunch there are three flowers which one already set and no runners yet but i'm hoping for runners you can see the stems are actually really pink you can see this one this one is older so i think it's kind of daft and it doesn't really have that much fuzz not as much as the newer ones you can see sometimes they push out flowers and new growth at the same time like this one and now this one's going a little bit bigger but yeah i'm really looking forward for these babies to ripen and i kind of can't wait to taste them so um yeah that's just a really quick update on my um strawberry plants bye", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video

feel that I'm wait about two hours and come back and let you guys know how I feel it it tastes really delicious it did taste like weed not like overpowering like disgusting you know weed flavor but it is a clicker good you do taste of marijuana it's not overpowering where it's like completely gross but you do taste it they know it's gonna be an edible cuz they're gonna taste it not super strong but they're gonna taste that [ __ ] how they held it the right amount continue on South Fairview Street for four miles strawberry cheesecake he's really good know how I feel about an hour - okay so all

locker you know bring their faces there's a part of me really advanced for you okay nothing a little time thank feet I know I know my diary I know mostly the edibles make me indoors little feet rise slowly and an email heels battle but I was very curious I guess", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to see more reviews and if you've tried wild please leave a comment below and tell

be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "xFUysDX_TWI": "hey Kenan mommies I'm just checking in I had the other B H oh but I think it's what it's called I can't remember this very moment yeah so no I overlay my favorite it was really really really chewy like it was a hard candy than a soft candy which I mentioned before is not my favorite which if you're into her candy she might be your thing but as some of us mentioned it even look kind of awkward when I was eating it like it was definitely a little big for my liking overall the medicated aspect of it I mean I didn't really get a lot out of it I don't know maybe if her candies are not my way to get medicated it seems that the brownie has been the only thing that's giving me a really good kick yeah I also have a really high tolerance I've noticed so that could be the other reason why but if you ever lower lower tolerance maybe these could be something that you could try and let me know if they work for you because they definitely didn't really work for me whatever reason but I'd love to hear your feedback on it and if someone else had a different experience maybe let me know I don't know very odd it's not even like I was eating a whole bunch before that they would maybe get absorbed I did also mention that I am on my period so that has been known to have a little bit of an effect with females well a lot of effect apparently because apparently we need to smoke a lot more and consume a lot more when it is her time of the month for whatever reason thank you mother nature but yeah overall they were bad I went about get them again no probably not um as I said I'm just all about the soft I just keep saying brownie I really wanted to be a brownie apparently it's the fudge I really really like the fudge so far that has been my favorite but yeah I have a few more things to try so stay tuned and hopefully I'll be able to get some more stuff and keep reviewing I also do have another exciting interview coming up possibly later on early next week I'm in the process of kind of putting together that review because it's a little bit longer and I'm kind of getting that one together but I'm first gonna do an unboxing of it yeah stay tuned and if you have

Channel Denver coming back at you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "5RyTD1T9tOU": "what is up fam organic Ombuds back with the review with some edibles this time it's from MKX auto co it's 100 milligrams gummies five pieces 20 milligrams each made with premium MKX gold distillates the flavor is blazing blue raspberry I've had regular blue raspberry other companies like this magnet it's been tested by CSI labs got the transfer past testing batch production batch license facilitated worthlessness ill-advised that product date and use by all that I'll have picks up a note let's try to open because they're a pain in the ass not just like these things really don't know so there's like the little lips sealed down in there you take your nail any kind of like work into it just kind of break it free after a second and then you can break in [Music] nice little thick pieces [Music] cheers fans definitely got blueberry although that's amazing flavor really amazing flavor there so if you got a have tried MKX and they're coming let me know which ones you've tried what you thought of them flavor is on point really can't taste too much of a chain see on the back end definitely a lot of flavor from glue right there definitely high quality made there nice clean taste good pretty much I want to say I was not allergy free but there's pretty much very slim chance you're gonna be allergic to anything that's in this there's no milk eggs fish felt shellfish tree nuts peanuts wheat soy were used during production of this product so pretty much almost hit just about everything but thank you [Music] about six or seven ingredients to actually make it [Music] we've got your little scan codes for your testing results scan it right at your phone results from right over your phone you can make sure everything's legit with this company which they are great company I had the watermelon the other day and they were off the hook so I was like how I gotta try these grab some of the blue radish play some blue raspberry may definitely pop off tonight nice and strong which was resin so I'm gonna jump out of here maybe do a update and a dab let you know how I feel usually these I take to relax my body wind down I guess put the end of the night they're more of like a pain and the relaxer but I'm jumping out much love respect BAM later [Music]", "7KjihoRsDHE": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this huckleberry hard candy by Bill ferns hard candy company so they actually reached out to me like two days ago and since I'm Sony with this I'm gonna just basically accommodate most most people who do reach out and ask me if I can review so the way I'm doing this as I had the blue raspberry one last night and that was kind of like on me so I don't like blue raspberry or like I don't like raspberry in general like at all so I don't know why I got blue raspberry but if you like raspberry the flavors really good if you don't don't buy it's not you're not gonna like it it's just got that like the raspberry sourness to it and I just like I said it's a personal it's a choice on the taste the hi itself though it was really like it if I was a new if I was a new smoker and I was just getting started this is a perfect way to like get your intro into edibles because one piece is going to be just enough to give you like the feeling that you're after the feeling that most people like associate with edibles but in a mild enough dose that you're still gonna be full control you're not gonna like pass out fall asleep you're not gonna you're not gonna have like a crazy freak out because you had one piece this is a 10 milligram piece of candy so it's not that big if you're more like if you're more of a daily like you smoke every day after works I think then you can go ahead and have two two or two three and then if you really really want to make sure that you're not gonna wake up at all then you brought out four to five but you know like I said it's everyone's personal choice with that I'm going to go ahead and pop this guy open they don't have this score marks which I don't like because I have to like cut it beforehand otherwise I don't like doing that so there's that when you open it at first Wow so here's my package and it's already open I was cool I don't know how that oh yeah it just wasn't sealed all the way that's awesome so yeah this is a huckleberry candy that's really good oh yeah so yeah I definitely shouldn't I got the blue raspberry if I would have got the huckleberry one I probably would eat both last night this is really really good you don't taste any of the marijuana at all yeah Naruto you get a little bit of the tickle that you get in the back of the throat whenever you have like a candy farm edible but that just comes with any of these really good like really really good oh my god yeah definitely if you go with this one the huckleberry if you're gonna buy them this is hands-down you're not gonna have no complaints yeah anyway man I'm really enjoying it so I got a bunch of stuff to finish I gotta go do a bunch of like cooking and a bunch of other stuff for the rest of the day alright so that was the huckleberry bill affords hard candy and yeah like I said this thing's delicious so if you guys get a chance definitely go pick some up and go", "4P2-eqMOeT8": "[Music] welcome to week skies the marijuana review show and I'm the one with the cavalier lis throwing around these scissors and I've got scissors in my hand not because I'm reviewing scissors I'm sure that there probably is a market out there for somebody who wants to review scissors no I've got scissors because I'm here to open a tough package one that I knew I'm gonna have trouble with but one that I am excited for because it is my one of my favorite kinds of edibles and that is the chocolate bar ooh the Sun is making that very difficult to see bad son bad bad son la familia it's the product of Los Angeles the mint flavor I read all the Spanish in English oh it looks like there's like four years of Spanish paid off so this is the la familia de la I almost said that terribly mint to flavor 200 milligrams of THC really that is quite obnoxious how that shows up they're very thin curtains I have um very simple packaging on this it's just like a little aluminum wrapper on this green kind of iridescent packaging you can feel not much to it again just like a sticker on an aluminum packaging it does have nutrition facts and ingredients on the back which is great but no lab test results so this is came from a black market or gray market dispensary in California because we all we all know all legal edibles are now 100 milligram edibles topped and they have to be ten servings or more this is an old-school 200 don't give a [ __ ] how many servings so let's go ahead and cut open the top here take a look at this chocolate bar give it a taste and if you've never tuned in before and if you have tuna before you must really [ __ ] hate here this by now but if you haven't the way of the reviews work here on weeds is I'm gonna eat a little bit of this here in front of you not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll eat this whole thing and then after I finish it I will come back to you guys in another two hours write us about when you'd be peaking to let you know how the product is actually hitting because that's what you're really in it for that's what you really care about is you know is it really gonna make you is it really gonna work not so much how it tastes okay Wow a very basic looking chocolate bar here totally basic it doesn't even have like an imprint with their logo on it or anything it is just what 12 squares of or twelve rectangles of chocolate I'm not gonna break it off into single rectangles let's just give it bite on three it smells like no I don't really detect a cannabis odor to it definitely a mint odor I'm a fan of mint chocolate I know there are a lot of mint chocolate haters out there I don't understand that but teach their own okay that's pretty good chocolate I'm decent quality chocolate for sure the mint flavor is not overwhelming I've definitely had some mint chocolates that are way more minty flavor more of a hint of mint here which is nice really no cannabis tasting I can't really detect much of any no hmm well what I hope that means is the chocolate is excessively masking the flavor of the cannabis and not that there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there mmm I never got to mention I picked this up on at the dispensary that I mentioned for $17 I believe which is two dollars more than they charge for a two hundred and thirty sixty milligram delta-9 which are excellent so high expectations for the la familia mint 200 milligrams here well guys I'm gonna eat another nine squares of this and then I will be back to you as I said in two hours let you know how it's hitting thanks for watching weights guys see in just a bit peace [Music] it's two hours later hi guys welcome back uh it has been 2 hours since I had the la familia and that still does not show up very well on this camera and I apologize for that there's a little bit of a better angle and the familiar the family that la familia is together families together is my review the end no my more elaborate view is it's pretty good it's not the most potent chocolate bar I've ever had chocolate bars are usually I believe the strongest and best vector for THC this one doesn't feel like a - like a kiva equivalent to me certainly not not even close really but it's still pretty good I'm at about a 6 right now some somewhere in that range so it's not you know terrible I've had 200 milligram edibles that are way worse and it didn't it tasted pretty good there's really no cannabis taste so you know on the whole I it's not the best you know there are certainly better chocolate bars out there I still would even probably recommend one of the new Kiva 100 milligrams over this la familia 200 milligram but if it's although your dispensary has and you like the chocolate bars this one's got a good taste it'll still do the job it's just probably not honest about that 200 milligrams would be my guess so if you have no other options and you like chocolate grab it otherwise go with one of the better brands pick up a kiva pick up a default say even probably a chill that one doesn't taste as good but I think it's more potent so stick with the bit the bit better brands if you can otherwise la familia is not a bad alternative and that is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm gonna give you a very quick cherry on top guys just a soup quick little cherry on top something just so delightful and hairy I'll get you out of here real quick and that is cursing swearing profanity I mean I've been profanity since before my teenage years [ __ ] I [ __ ] love cursing it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] damn [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's great um if you if you don't curse a lot you should curse more if you don't curse at all what the [ __ ] is wrong with you cursing is the best the science is on my side you know they say that people who curse are more intelligent they're more honest they're more empathetic I've read that they actually have bigger dongs and that they're also better lovers to that I most of those are things that I've read so uh curse say [ __ ] a lot you'll like it la familia it's not that shitty thank you for sticking around to the end of this cherry on top thank you for sticking tuned to the end of this review appreciated Alice always guys it's been a [ __ ] blast see on the next week's peace", "jtlJqBuXuzk": "alright hey y'all get ready to make some candy grapes alright the first thing you'll need is a bag of Jolly Ranchers I got the bag that was I think 248 at Walmart and first thing you gonna toss up I wrapped with the Jolly Ranchers and I'm using my blender to chop them up and I end up pressing post and it chopped it up to fine some people that have this like what kind of bigger pieces in my I was like powder kinda alright and right here you can see that how fine I made it the only thing with a jolly wrench day it's gonna get back you get hard so I end up putting it back in a blender later on alright next you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar I can get another cup of sugar [Music] there's a second cup of shirt alright next is a half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the Cairo sir when you put all of it into your partner and I just use a small pot because it's not gonna make them rich all right and this thing make sure you mix it up pretty good before you get ready to put it on the stove so you don't try to mix it up while it's cooking and with the heat on the stove this temperature saying I put it between four or five or so [Music] alright next one get ready to cook it alright you have to let the temperature reach between two hundred and eighty degrees and two hundred and ninety degrees under cooking thermometer so make sure you watching it cuz you don't want to burn it and be careful you don't want to burn yourself all right this is parchment paper not wax paper make sure you use parchment paper alright then I have my bowl of grits I've washed and dried those all right and then I have two pieces if you have any longer sticks you want to use you can use those because to me it's the kind of dangerous because you can burn yourself with it so small do not put the soup in the hole that's our baton the great with the grapes tin came from you make your own hole on the opposite cuz it'll stick better the hole on the other side is kind of big already I'll have my line that already [Music] all right it's cooking here makes you glad to get it two hundred and eighty degrees all right here's I just took it off the stove this is outlook right with it also all right next thing is you gonna need some flavor and the flavoring I use is the Lawrence flavor I use cheering and it's the bottle synthesizes a dream I only use half a bottle since I didn't make that much and it's gonna turn it red that's in the brain in it all right Mitchell see me add in another drop of the flavor just get a little flavor but after that you weigh if you have the liquid white food coloring in the jail that's when you add that you don't see me use it because I went to last minute trying to find some but using the liquid white learn it would give your stuff a brighter color so I want to be see through my stuff you'll see it's let me see - have a seat - color eye whatever but I didn't care cuz kids I know they was still eating but so give it that deep coloring you need the white liquid gel color and then we use your color that you wanted to be but now you're gonna see me and then I have just regular gel food cuz I'm using the colored seal and again it's gonna be basically almost air clear when I put it on the grades because I didn't have the whitener so again make sure if you want the bright colors that you see everybody else using use the white liquid gel color the whitener and then you're gonna use like a few drops to everything I didn't you see me just scooping some till your food coloring my Chi mix it up that my sister she started dipping already and you gotta make sure you working fastest and starting heart and hard and fast and I still ting to pot to the side so I can make sure lit all around to the side all right you start dipping it but then you see my candy and hey got heart the Jolly Rancher candy and I end up later on putting it back inside the blender to chop it up again good say the thing with the Jolly Rancher is it says for some reason because it's so sticky I know hardest but you go ahead and just make sure you working fast cuz the candy that you made will get hard fast and the Jolly Rancher soon so just dip it and I don't want to do have I didn't some people that I dip the whole thing I only did half of it great and we end up doing strawberry so we didn't record record ourselves on the strawberries and when you dip it just hurry up and sprinkle a pot on before it gets hard and they're just laid on a parchment paper all right here you can kind of see it better what a good grapes doesn't see just really missing again you see my stuff is fired it's pretty fine like a little powder some people have bigger chunks with Jolly Ranchers than theirs but it all stays the same all right this is finished product it came out pretty good for the first time if you want to see my kids do the taste test check out her Channel say whatcha Larry thanks for watching", "LZJbqRUlzRA": "[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a

Reporter:", "MewQRwSYdiM": "[Music] hi there buds and welcome back to my kitchen I've been looking over the comment section of the edible videos that I've done recently and I've noticed that the most requested thing that people want are how to make weed gummies so I thought it would make weed gummy bears with you guys let me show you guys what you guys will need to make some weed gummies so the first thing that you're going to need are some type of gummy molds I chose little gummy bears and it came with a dropper which this is really convenient for transporting the gummy mixture into each of these little molds I'll have a link in the description of this video with all of the materials that I use next you will need an ounce of gelatin which is all four envelopes in the box you'll also need a pack of your favorite flavored jello I chose strawberry and you also need 1/4 of a cup of cannabis coconut oil if you don't know how to make cannabis coconut oil click up here and I'll show you how and then lastly you'll need a large saucepan and a whisk let's get to making some gummies in a saucepan on high heat you want to add your 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut oil and 1 in 1/2 cups of water to your saucepan and you want to whisk that together and let that boil and incorporate together all right I've had this boiling for about five minutes and it seems to be pretty well incorporated the next step to do is to start to add your gelatin one packet at a time and whisk it thoroughly in before adding the next packet [Music] when you first add the gelatin it starts to clump off but then as you mix it in you will see that it will fully incorporate that's when you should add the next packet of gelatin [Music] once you've added and incorporated all four packets of gelatin you can go ahead and add your packet of jell-o mix [Applause] now you're going to want to let this cook for about five to eight minutes until it fits to a rolling boil so that is what a rolling boil looks like and as you guys can see it is super stringy and it has changed consistency it is like really really goopy really sticky really thick turn your heat down to low and then we'll get ready to put this into a mold next you can go ahead and fill each of the individual bear molds be sure to continue mixing your mixture to ensure that it doesn't get clumped up it's also good to check on your mixture every few minutes because it can burn and you don't want your mixture to burn [Music] [Music] once you get it completely filled go ahead and use a paper towel to clean up the edges as much as you can as you guys can see I was a little messy but this should be fine I'm gonna go ahead and pop this in the refrigerator you want to keep it in there for about 30 minutes they should become firm after that and we'll go ahead and try these out all right I just got these out of the refrigerator now let's go ahead and plot these out and then we were taste [Music] or actually guys so here are my gummy beggars they actually turned out really cute I don't know if you guys can see that but it is a little bear Cheers I can't taste wheat in it at all it kind of just tastes like jello but they're like really firm you're definitely the right consistency they're coming I would describe it as like a gummy candy it's very sweet [Music] not weedy at all these are really really good if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below on what else I should make as far as cannabis edibles go because honestly taste wise I would go cannabutter cookies and then this cannabis coconut oil gummies as far as taste because these are actually like really good don't taste me at all but yeah this is cannabis gummy bears hope you guys make these because these are good and subscribe to my channel

them since the start of the year and people are really excited that they're here so what's the supply bin I take it that at times I might come into the store and you're out that's right yeah so the province is limiting each customer to a certain amount per per order we were only allowed to order once a week so every week we get our stock in and within a couple days it's gonna sell out so what sorts of people are showing an interest in eating their cannabis rather than smoking or vaporizing so smoking and vaporizing is harder on your lungs and as you get older it becomes harder and harder so a lot of people who are used to consuming cannabis are starting to change to edibles in order to avoid that harsh feeling on their lungs as you age it just becomes you get to a point where you cough more and it's not as enjoyable so edibles is a great alternative to getting it into you and it's actually a healthier alternative than smoking so sort of demographic you've noticed that's showing more of an interest in these edibles yeah I'd say there's a lot of the older crowd coming in to grab edibles because they like I was saying don't want to smoke it but there are young younger adults as well that are doing both grabbing some flour and grabbing an edible as well they kind of come on a little bit differently and it's it's a little bit of a different experience has it now I take it that the maximum sort of per serving is this ten milligrams that's right yeah Health Canada capped it at 10 milligrams I I think they wanted to start slow I'm hoping that they increase the package cap because for a lot of consumers ten milligrams is enough for me it is enough I find 10 milligrams as a perfect dose but for people who have built up a tolerance and we're talking about people who are consuming cannabis on a daily basis those people ten milligrams just isn't its it won't give them the effects that they're looking for what would someone expect to be different if they're if they're eating their cannabis instead of smoking it had is it a different sort of high that they get from it um it's it's gonna be a slower onset so when you smoke cannabis the effects take place immediately whereas when you ingest it it goes through the digestive system so it on sets a little bit slower a half hour to an hour wait sometimes to actually start to take effect the and there there it is a little different in terms of what the effects are this package here now chocolates yeah now what other sort of food items have they managed to also cookies gummies there's candy choose there are did I say brownies no you didn't know yeah yeah brownies and infused drinks we're all coming down the pipeline drinks you have to come though drinks have yet to come I have seen the marketing for them very exciting there's sparkling waters and there's like a THC additive it's it comes a liquid little bottle that you can add to like a coca-cola a soft drink telling us about it

my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed

camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "tBA1GuudS9o": "what's up guys it's Joe elegant back at it with another review you guys know what it is by now you guys should and I

review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "oZvjQqbiJwk": "it's going on YouTube Jedi here it's been few days anyway since my last update it's gonna be a quick one I got clones I got a cutting stuff half a plant to trim still so but what I wanted to do is come out you guys Kelly stop your warning girl I'll let you in a minute stop this is my girl right here I'm a pup Kelly tsuyoi say I speak speak good girl anyway so I made these canna butter infused candies and I got the recipe from star Delta nines channel so for any of you who are not subscribed to her be sure to check her out she does a lot of different cooking recipes she has her own girl she's uh she's a wild chick that's for sure but anyway I wanted to do hard candies for the longest [ __ ] time and I just stumbled across this and that was about all four or five days ago and since I made these freakin candies guys I have been fried I have been met so medicated since these things are awesome they taste freakin great so without further ado these here are the lollipops I made them with orange jell-o flavored and they got some icing sugar on them quite a bit more than probably most people would put on them to be honest but I love it and then I made these little swirly candies a lot of it was because it you know it was my first time it's just for me a lot of it was just what's built out all over the cookie molds and stuff but these candies guys it calls for half a cup I believe of yeah half a cup of peanut butter and most recipes that I've been finding trying to find a cookie rest era candy recipe is with like tink stirs and oils and stuff so when I found this I was in my frigging glory and honestly guys they taste good the taste is really good they went raw card like they're rock candies man they're rock candies and if you look it's actually a mustache lollipop these ones are so that's pretty funny but yeah so I got these little molds small ones and I'm in Candy's boat here being a sec both this big so in my opinion if I'm eating candy this size right here it better be able to give me what I want you know I finally know one candy I want to make sure that I'm getting medicated from it and this stuff works great when I came to Cal no friggin way oh no hey so I just dropped this one on the ground so I'm gonna have to eat it no but yeah I wanted to show make a quick video just to let you guys know on both these candies and like I said the recipe is on stardoll tonight's channel so if you want the recipe you're gonna have to sub er up and you're gonna have to watch the video for yourself and get it yourself I was gonna post it on here for you guys but I thought you know I know put it on making you guys go and subscribe to her and that'll get her some more people and well [ __ ] she's

updates and everything so yup guys all right this is Jedi coming at you with a candy update peace out", "d8qzatZ2syo": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi oh we're making THC infused microwave keto gummies we're going to steep 40 bags in one in third cup boiling water for one hour until everything is cool I want to make sure I have one full cup of my tea we'll stir in unflavored gelatin four tablespoons slowly continually stirring so that it doesn't clump up I'll allow that to bloom for ten minutes then I'll microwave for 90 seconds stirring every 30 seconds I'll now add 1/2 teaspoon of citric acid lecithin and liquid stevia as well as 5 flavor oil drops I'll be also adding purple food coloring once that is mixed microwaving again for 30 seconds I'll now be adding 340 milligrams of a THC distillate and once again mixing that well I found that using a condiment bottle to fill my molds works well so I'll transfer that fluid over now and you'll want to use an oven mitt or love of sorts because this bottle will be warm [Music] time to see if seahorses can swim in ice [Music] after freezing for 15 minutes well pop our gummies Oh 34 10 milligram keto microwave gummies enjoy be sure to subscribe to this channel for updates and notifications whenever we post a new video thanks for watching", "_qLXHN_lvhA": "quick video on how to make sour candy gummies you'll need one box of jell-o three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin which is about four bags 1/4 cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up let me know what you think in the comments and also subscribe to my channel thank you guys [Music]", "YurzDui9D5k": "hey you guys welcome back to my channel so today is actually 4/20 I have not done anything yet because yeah I just got back home so you know whatever but now we're here together and we're going to eat an edible that I have not eaten before and I really wanted to try this because I saw a video about it and then I was like a hot chocolate edible like does it really taste like hot chocolate um I'm a big fan of chocolate I love chocolate I love cookies I love brownies I'm all about chocolate so when I saw this I was like oh yeah I totally want to try this you know so I went into sensory and I think it's kind of a tradition of Mines that I always eat an edible on 4/20 I usually don't buy edibles just because I'm more of like a smoker person today I'm going to be reviewing the law fam\u00edlia cannabis choc a cannabis infused chocolate bar okay and this is in the flavor hot chocolate as you can see I love the packaging the color is so beautiful this is um this is a legit legit product so yeah it has basically all of your like serving suggestions and ingredients and it tells you like dosage and directions and it says to wait two hours for effects before consuming more so this is 100 milligrams I've had edibles that were literally like three 400 I think the most I've done is probably 300 milligrams and I probably like shared it with somebody so it's probably like a hundred and fifty that I did you know if I'm guessing right you know right so on the back right here it basically has its tested for life parasites and stuff EHC is nine point zero seven per serving so I already opened it up for you guys so you guys can check it out so for like each little name it's like it tells you like cuz I'm guessing the bars the bar looks like this and ten milligrams ten milligrams ten milligrams so for each serving is like ten milligrams 10.30 for CBD per package so I guess the whole package now most likely if I really enjoy this I'm probably gonna just eat all of it or I might just eat half of it I really don't know if I don't really like it I might just eat half of it and they say the other half are like tomorrow I don't know so when you open it up it comes in like this little Ziploc bags so if you don't want to eat it you know like all of it then you can totally store it yeah and then on here it basically like it's the same stuff it has like the ingredients this is Matt this is total sugars of 56 grams so and this does have like it has nonfat milk so if you know you don't consume dairy just FYI so I'm ready to [ __ ] taste this so I watched a video and they said to like do something like this and then it opens it up oh oh oh okay I'm kind of getting like a weed edge smell they they smell like chocolate and then like kind of like the Abuelita the hot chocolate the Mexican one and yeah so let's just get into it right let's just try one so this is basically 20 milligrams a one oh wow I am so sorry for my smacking I was oh my god Wow so it's literally literally it's like you know when you like eat like a chocolate chip or like the the hot chocolate that I was talking about and let's say you know you cut into little pieces or like thin little pieces and you know you make [ __ ] chocolate out of it or something this literally tastes just like that it doesn't even like taste like its own chocolate it literally tastes like hot chocolate I'm not bad at it because I don't want to try this I like it would I buy it again probably not this exact one but maybe like try something else from the brand I don't know but I can't really say if I would buy it again until I know how the high is and how much how potent it is or whatnot I mean it says 100 milligram spot and you know why like after I'm done eating it I do feel like there's a little bit of like I can taste a little bit of wheat because I'm so familiar with weed because I usually smoke almost every other day you know I just know if it has weed in it and smelling it it smells like chocolate I don't think you could really tell if you were to just give it to somebody I don't think they would know mmm so I'm loving it more and then any more of those I'm probably just gonna try to finish it I don't know or me just have half I don't know maybe I might just have half I don't know yet but I'm going to be back within an hour or two hours I know it takes like two hours for usually for edibles to kick in so I'll be back when that happens and I'm gonna tell you guys how high this got me because I want to know - just like you want to know so you know how you know that didn't even make sense that there are you guys okay you guys so I've had so far I have had I wanted to do a little update because I didn't want shot a thing that I didn't eat at all you know what I mean so I ate half of it right okay so that's 15 million absolutely it's gone she's gone so my thoughts as of right now as of just consuming 50 milligrams 50 now 60 70 um I think it's really easy to eat honestly I like it I did like let it chill in the fridge for a little bit and then take it out so it's like the perfect like chocolate consistency just because it was room time but you guys don't care about that but I don't know if it's me or if edibles hit me hard or fast or if I'm thinking they're hitting me because I'm eating this already but I already am starting to feel a little different I don't know why I mean no I don't feel like a full-on [ __ ] faded or I don't even feel high but I know I ate some edibles and they're gonna hit and I'm thinking they're already hitting but they haven't even hit yet like I haven't even been 30 minutes I gotta keep a track of time okay so I had this literally at like probably like 6:00 or 6:10 so I'm guessing by like 8:00 to 8:30 I should be feeling the effects of this so I'm just gonna finish the rest of this and then once you know I am at the peak of my fated Ness I will check in back with you guys and I will tell you my initial thoughts of is that worth it I spent around $20 on this edible you guys $20 and that's not that much you know I mean for an edible that's pretty the normal range but if I'm paying $20 and I could have gotten another edible that would have got me way more lit then I want to let you know you know but this is my first time ever trying this brand the love familiar it is a product of Los Angeles so you know I'm pretty sure it's gonna be good you know it's gonna be lit so I'm just gonna eat this up and I'll check in back with you guys as soon as I'm done with it well as soon as I feel it okay okay you guys so I'm back with another update as always I don't think you can see me all that great so I'm gonna go by my window because it's about to be getting dark so it's probably like so I finished eating my out of all it is completely gone when you show you the [ __ ] wrapper it's gone I knew it was a tough thing to do but we're [ __ ] done with her okay so now you guys can see it better this was the la familia hot chocolate product of Los Angeles cannabis infused chocolate 100 milligrams so I consumed this I think I probably did it within like 10 15 minutes I don't know not even thumbs deviants are like 10 minutes I just had to kind of eat it slow because it was a lot of sweetness going on you know and I'm not really like a sweet tooth person I mean I like sweets here and there but eating a whole chocolate bar is kind of a lot so but I did it I did it I wanted to get really lit for 420 so I'm going I basically have a timer already going for like an hour and a half so I keeps at the time and not get too high and forget about it so once I am you know one hour and thirty minutes into this then I will come back with you guys and I will let you know how my I get so you already know deal yo okay guys I wanted to do a [ __ ] update because it's like 8 o'clock like 8:30 and I definitely feel the edibles they hate hard I think next time I'll probably do like 50 because I took a couple of like puffs off of like plug and play and look how fried I am I mean I don't know if you can tell but I'm [ __ ] fried but yeah I mean I would rate that at", "VSTcZSRcJlI": "[Music] this is the first time that you're joining me and if you're one of the regular subscribers thank you very much the first thing I just really want to say is I'm guessing by the growing popularity of subscribers that you guys are enjoying the videos and that really means the world to me it really gives me the motivation and an incentive to really want to put out make more of these for you and come up with really great recipes that work with candy butter and start to expand into some other products like some lotions lip balms things like that so I am working on those recipes and those videos will be coming in the future so again if you're new please subscribe I there's gonna be some really good stuff coming forward so today we are gonna be making canna butter fudge this is a super simple pledge recipe it's what are the easy fudge recipes there are kind of two you've got your four ingredient super easy fudge recipe and then you've got your traditional cooking recipe cooking fudge I'm gonna do a video on that one I did do one before not a video but I did try the recipe and it was an epic fail so I've been a little leery about trying it again and but I'll definitely put that together for you so you've got the easy and the more and the more traditional type so just have a look here this one's just setting up right now I've got that setting so got some good to be going over everything that you need for this and how to make some super easy fudge at home alright so I'm just gonna switch up our camera angle and we'll get started so you're gonna need three cups of chocolate chips either dark chocolate or milk chocolate your preference one can of sweetened condensed milk and a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1 tablespoon of canna butter and one tablespoon of unsalted butter now if you want to go super-duper on on dosing them you can go with two tablespoons you want to use a glass container a glass oven safe container pan and you can use the 9-inch rectangular one or but it should be glass and you want to line it with parchment paper now one thing I do is to make it easy is I make cuts into the corners so that way you can tuck it in it'll tuck in and it makes it much easier to get it to fit nicely into the pan if any of you tried to fit parchment paper in it's a nightmare trying to get it to fit down so this makes it really easy to to help you to get it to sit in nice and flat and then what I'll do is I just use some butter to tack the edges down so you can use a double boiler or the microwave I prefer double boiler I'm old-school if you're using a double boiler you set it up set your heat to medium-low put in your chips and your butter and mix them together if you're using the microwave same thing put it in a microwave safe Bowl add your chocolate chips and your butter and for heating you want to mix it started a 30-second interval then go to 2010 and then continue at 10-second intervals until you're fully melted doing the double boiler you want to just mix in your butter and continue stirring until your chocolate is fully melted [Music] [Music] whether your chocolate is almost melted you want to remove it from the heat and then continue stirring until it is fully melted you don't see any lumps at all [Music] once your chocolates all smooth you're gonna add in the sweetened condensed milk and the vanilla and you're going to continue to stir that until everything is fully incorporated as you stir you're going to notice it's gonna stiffen up its gonna get stiffer and it's gonna get a grainy ER texture to it so you're going to continue stirring until you start to get that grainy texture and trust me it gets a little hard on the arm [Music] so continue stirring until all your ingredients are fully incorporated and your chocolate starts to lose its Sheen at this point you're going to transfer it over to it to your glass parchment-lined glass container [Music] you can use an offset spatula to even out your fudge to make sure it's nicely even in your container [Music] once you've got it all nice and even you're gonna put it in the fridge for a minimum of two hours to set hi so it's been two hours and I've taken the fudge out of the refrigerator it is set up really nicely so we're just gonna cut it up and we're gonna give it a taste and see what it tastes like so if you ever wonder I just I usually like using rubber gloves whenever I'm working with chocolate so that your fingerprints don't get on it because your hands chocolate on melts that your with your body temperature so you're just gonna take it out of the container and we're gonna work off the parchment paper off looks like fudge so that looks really nice look at that alright you're just gonna cut it up and see what it tastes like so for cutting these I usually I like to use these type of I don't even know what they're called no no it's flat thing that'll cut stuff but I like this one because it has a measuring so if you you can measure your stuff out it for cutting so this is six inches so I'm gonna probably do about one inch cuts I'm gonna mark them off take let's do half inch yeah that's better so I'm just gonna take off this edge versus because it's not very even it's kind of ratty just take that off just press down and that's it no she certainly looks like fudge so it's up to you I mean those are pretty big pieces like that I would probably have these mm-hmm now obviously depending on how much you put in is how you're gonna dose it so however many pieces you're cutting this into and I will actually figure out what the dosing on this what this particular batch would have been yeah I know I'm not very good I'm not very even close enough there you've got it your fudge I hope you can cut a little bit more even than I can some things I lack a little bit on so let's give so that's our fudge and let's give it a taste so once you've cut up your fudge to keep it fresh you want to wrap it up your individual pieces in some plastic wrap and make sure to just wrap them nice and tight and that'll keep them nice and fresh for you so the milligrams for the 14 pieces that I've made here is gonna be about 15 milligrams per my starting THC with my butter was 22% for the bud that is used so as instead of puts that in with using the 1 tablespoon puts it about 15 milligrams per going with the 2 tablespoons is gonna put it around obviously the 30 between 25 and 30 off depending on your starting THC so that's it for the tutorial on easy can of fudge I hope you enjoyed it if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and if you try the recipe I'd love to hear how yours turned out and if you if you are new this is your first time watching I am and

bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you

Johns County Sheriff's Office says this should be a reminder for parents particularly around Halloween I don't believe that someone who's doing on a drug trade for for profit if you will in distribution would hand it out freely to children but then again you don't know and that is a concern every year parent should be paying attention during Halloween for their kids candy and what goes in their bag but especially now because my understanding is that Colorado has seen some of these instances and not just Colorado but any of the states that have the legalize marijuana in their states currently that kids are getting their hands on this and the man who's been arrested from st.

must I will repeat you must have that in mind all the time if you let your guard down you could get severe third-degree burns in a second if you don't know what is a third-degree burn look it up on the Internet it's too gross for me to show it to you here so number one remove kids and pets from the kitchen number two prepare a large bowl filled with ice water and place it as close as possible to your stop and number three practice now I would advise multiple dry runs meaning instead of the pot with boiling sugar place two bowls of water adjacent to one another one with ice water and another with hot water and just go through the motions dip your hand in cold water keep it there until you can feel the cold in your fingertips then in one swift fluid movement dip only your fingertips in another Bowl pull back your hand quickly but calmly and dip your fingers again in the ice water you see the secret is this if you keep your hand in ice water long enough your skin will be very cold so when it comes to contact with boiling sugar the heat of the sugar will be reduced your skin will actually cool the sugar I know that this sounds crazy but this is the truth for only a split second but that is enough time so that you can reach the ice water or gap and there the sugar will harden instantly without harming your hand now all this looks intimidating I know and it is but like I said practice with water and you'll be okay now why do we do this well we don't actually you see if you buy a candy thermometer you will never have to touch the boiling sugar because just by reading this of the thermometer you will know in what stage your sugar is if however you don't have a candy thermometer or you simply want to learn how to perform this technique so that you can impress your friends keep watching now in my post the link is down below you will find detailed information regarding usage of sugar syrup and caramel in the various desserts it is extremely versatile either as a vital component of a dessert or as a standalone sweet like for example caramel candy without you absolutely cannot make let's say chocolate salted carrots or nougat not to mention chocolate parfait or lemon meringue tart etc not only that with caramel you can also make beautiful decorations for your cakes and much much more so after watching this video make sure to read my post but now stay with me I will dip my fingers in boiling sugar just for your viewing pleasure let's make some sugar syrups to make sugar syrup I'm gonna put sugar and some water into a saucepan and gently stir to hydrate all the sugar the water should cover the sugar don't put too much because you will have to cook syrup longer to reach desired temperature at this point I'll brush the size of the saucepan with cold water to wash down any sugar crystals that could later cause problems to my sugar syrup another way to wash down the crystals is to simply put the lid on once the syrup balls the steam will wash down any sugar crystals from the sides of the pan my syrup is boiling so I'm going to remove the lid and put some glucose into the syrup that will prevent crystallization of the syrup I'm gonna insert my candy thermometer with the probe to see at what stage is my syrup from this point on I'm not stirring the syrup anymore red stage is at 107 degrees centigrade which is 224 degrees Fahrenheit I'm gonna take some syrup over the spoon and cool it in ice water when I rub syrup between my fingers and separate them the syrup will form a thin shreds only now exceptionally I'm using a spoon to show you this stage because if I were to use my fingers sugar syrup would have melted instantly in contact with the ice water this stage is used for cooking jams and sauces soft ball stage appears at temperatures between 116 degrees centigrade and 118 degrees centigrade which is 240 degrees Fahrenheit and 244 degrees Fahrenheit at this stage I can form the cooled syrup into a soft malleable ball we use syrup cooked to soft ball stage to make Italian meringue but a balm fudge and fondant icing [Music] firm ball occurs when sugar syrup is cooked to temperatures between 118 degrees centigrade and 121 degrees centigrade which is 245 degrees Fahrenheit to 250 degrees Fahrenheit at this stage I can form the cold syrup into a firm ball it is used for making caramel candy fruit jams and Italian meringue soft pract is the stage of cooking when syrup reaches between 135 and 140 degrees centigrade which is 275 to 284 degrees Fahrenheit hard crack is a stage of sugar syrup at temperatures between 145 and 155 degrees centigrade which is 293 to 311 degrees Fahrenheit it is used for making bonbons nougat sugar decorations of pulled and brown sugar [Music] caramel is the final stage of cooking sugar syrup it begins at 165 degrees centigrade which is three hundred and twenty-nine degrees Fahrenheit at this stage there is no more water in the syrup and sugar starts to break down to many complex compounds I've continued cooking my caramel and now at approximately 180 degrees centigrade which is 350 degrees Fahrenheit it changes color from light golden to deep brown caramel color varies depending on the temperature it ranges from pale yellow to amber to dark brown caramel is used to make bonbons nougatine creme caramel as a flavoring for various creams and custards or for making caramel decorations it is important that you learn how to cook sugar syrup because it is extremely versatile either as a component of a dessert or as a standalone sweet have fun [Music] I'm Teresa thanks for watching my

happiness see you in the next video bye [Music]", "UcQnm95hO0o": "[Music] hello what's up today I'm going to be doing an edible haul because I just stopped up like crazy but first a DAB or three probably three [Music] this is actually one of my favorite strains it's called the green crack the flower is super good it's a set to you but I think right now it's a whack so you can't see it sorry [Music] [Music] I think I'm gonna do one more because those last few hits sucked okay now I'm ready I just look like that meme have y'all seen yet the cat where they said that's how little kids cough because that's me that's how I cough anyways onto the hall so this is our little goodie bag actually this is a really big goodie bag and then we're actually gonna start on this cuz this didn't fit in the bag it's called give me some mores it is a marshmallow a chocolate-covered marshmallow with graham crackers on it it's by hon ooh there's ten pieces ten milligrams each so 100 milligrams total those are hopefully gonna be good I'm not a big fan of chocolate really or at least THC chocolate just because I feel like with like brownies cookies and chocolate you can taste the weight a lot more and when I eat an edible like of course I want weed in it like THC but I don't want to taste it I want to just be like I'm eating a snack I think that's the point of an edible or maybe not I don't know that's not the point of it but they're better to me when I really just taste like a regular food but then [Music] it's you hard anyways I wanted to try belts for so long I don't eat candy generally but I really love those sour airheads the belts are the strip's whatever the extremes I think is what it's called are having out of it forever but those are my favorite candies and I found these I don't want their sour but these are mango belts there's ten pieces two milligrams each oh they are sour sour ribbon candy and then I got the rainbow belts which hopefully are similar to the extremes lemon strawberry and Apple and these are by Flav I've never had this brand so I'm gonna have to look them up but excited and then I don't know if I mentioned the chips that I got from blue roots cannabis but they were nacho cheese and they were so good they taste a lime Doritos they were better than Doritos and I got him again they had four different flavors BBQ sour cream and onion ranch and nacho cheese and all four they were a 30% off they were only like four dollars I got yeah I got to barbecue these are a potato chip let me read what it says potato chips infused with barbecue seasoning sauce and a Southwestern mix of herbs and spices the nacho cheese ones tortilla chips seasoned with cheddar cheese and a zesty blend of Latin spices and herbs the reason I say that they're better than Doritos is because they have these little spices I don't know exactly because it just says Latin spices maybe it says yes chili pepper paprika and cayenne pepper is probably what makes them taste better like I said in my video about me I like spicy food so maybe that's why I like these more than regular Doritos these are the ranch these are don't eat chips seasoned with a blend of ranch seasoning paprika salt garlic and onion delish I bet these are like Ranch Doritos cuz they look just like it then the last ones are sour cream and onion potato chips with the dollop of sour cream and dusted with savory onion and garlic seasoning these all look pretty good the nacho ones like I said 10 out of 10 I keep talking about them but I can eat those as a regular snack and not know that they have lead in them [Music] they have a little kick whole bag is 10 milligrams so it's sort of a lower dosage because you got to eat like all the chips but they're good then the last atta boy I have in the sugar packets these are by hot sugar which is a fat Panda company fat Panda is pretty known over here they have like edibles flour all of that there are 10 packets 10 milligrams each the guy at the pawnshop said you can put it on peanut butter and jelly and your coffee and your juice really like anything so I'm excited to try these I don't know what I'm gonna use them with but I guess you'll see the retie about all of those edibles is because me and my husband are going to Cape Flattery which is the most northwestern part of the continental USA so that's exciting we have to take a ferry and everything it's going to take us about four or five hours to get there so as you can tell by the title of this video I am going to eat twenty ten milligram edibles I have ten packets of the sugar which I'm going to put in and then I'm going to taste test the other ten edibles that I got in that hole [Music] [Music] I actually just realized I forgot how [Music] [Music] they live [Music] [Music] [Laughter] crack cocaine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to collect you [Music] [Music] really excited to try these [Music] [Music] [Music] as I said before I took 20 edibles ten where the THC sugar packets to chips for of the rainbow sour belts two of the mango belts and two of the chocolate marshmallow things my honest opinion on them was that they were really good none of them really tasted like weed so that's a big thumbs up on them on all those brands both of the chips were really good because like I said before I would eat those just as normal snacks definitely recommend those as a lower dosage of edibles to start out with the sour bills were good the main goal lines in the video you probably saw me make a really funny face it has a weird aftertaste but the mango ones do taste like Mexican candy so that's good it might have just been the taste I was in my mouth at the moment but I don't know it was really bad the rainbow ones were good they tasted just like the extremes the chocolate-covered marshmallows were super chocolaty I had to wash my mouth out with a lemonade really good because it was a lot of chocolate which I personally don't like that much but it was pretty good the THC packets I really couldn't taste them I just felt like I was drinking a regular old toasted white chocolate mocha as far as like what I was doing we were in the car for almost five hours so I just played on my phone I played a fun run I talked to my husband I was really sleepy then once we got to Cape Flattery we did the trail which was about two or three miles I really don't remember but it was fine the view was really really pretty [Music]", "IZ5AS2mBK-w": "what's the hold on YouTube it's the Lauren aka Nubia 420 and today I will be making some storm and gummies into infused gummies with my own homemade tincture that I did here with a little Keith so if you've seen a green dragon video then you know how to make a tincture this specific one was made with Keef there is a video on that so if you're not sure how to do it check it out I will link it up here in in the cards and let's get started so we have gummies you can make any you can make this with any football company our Dollar Tree just happens to have these and we're gonna go ahead and cover them in some nerds so it's going to be the infamous nerd rope but not a rope shake because we're going to use these heart molds here so it'll be a little more adult then we're gonna have a good time so let's go ahead and get started we have our pot here with about an inch of water in it and then we have our mixing bowl and we're going to use this to double boil and then melt down work on these so that we can work with them so let's turn my stove on it turn to medium heat you don't want to heat it up medium-high heat and now we have a double boiler now I'm not the cook in this relationship so I don't make things from scratch so you will never see me making tactically scraps which is a video on our channel if you're interested I like cheap [Music] if you care about the colors of your dummy you should separate them and melt them down by color so just as these nope this isn't the easiest method it no honestly you can probably make some gummies from scratch it should be easier to work with the knees then whatever I had these I wanted to try it so here we are [Music] okay so we are this is what it looks like all melted down we're gonna go ahead and drop something tincture in and we're gonna mix that up so we calculated our texture at about three milligrams per drop and this is about 20 drops right here so we're just gonna throw that anything down this is a Everclear based texture it's not an oil-based tincture I don't know what this will work for William Hastings I'm sure there are recipes out there that use it you have to find one of those recipes this is alcohol you share it with us yes please no other if you know of a recipe that uses real oil-based future luckily in bully evaporate as this continues to heat it just a little bit more the treatises we added it which is good for porn is hormones [Music] Tomic shirts wet distribute it with it I do don't want one go meet us you know ten milligrams and then another tummy is 15 because another one is zero so I mix it up do this is you have to work fast so it's probably not a great idea to do a whole bunch at one time working in small batches it's probably better so don't we come over here I'm actually going to skip the measuring cup then just try to pull it straight into our moon from this bad boy right here so I'm always sprayed with cooking spray so try to help the release be a little bit easier I kept my double boil it is just home low just the case this heart is up to where I can't really work with it [Music] [Music] obviously if you're making these other people don't touch it fingers are you making it for yourself do whatever you want okay so we didn't get the entire tray filled we only have enough for two four six eight piece of seven and a half I want to call that one whole but now they're gonna go in the freezer for about two hours until you know they're nice and frozen never want to take them out and we'll cook them in the nerves and they will let them dry out so that's it into the freezer big deal okay so we grabbed our gummies out of the freezer I took them out after about an hour just because our freezers turned up so high and it's so tiny that it freezes super fast and um we're gonna pop them out and then what you want to do is take your nerve and spread them out on a tray or on a sheet so the phone and you see they're a little tacky but not totally you're just gonna sit them right in that sheet right there and then we're gonna go ahead and coat them for these delicious candies so it's not a rope but it's literally all the same ingredients as the rope but I feel like this is much more manageable a much more manageable tree and they just kind of so you want to let them fall out a little bit because they get tacky as they're falling but you see right now and it's not really sticking it does a little bit but you got to kind of work it and then what's your color these they're going to sit on the countertop now you can cover them with it's how and they'll sit on a countertop for I believe 24 hours 24 to 48 hours to dry out it's something that you want to do to you've got man so this part does take on a little bit of time to do making sure you get good and then we have our test one here that we've already covered as you can see but not too many it's not too bad you mean you just pop it in your mouth and eat it people seem to like them I'm not sure why but this needs on itself alright and here we have the final product our hearts covered in nerd ropes these are that when you sit out for probably a day or two just to dry out and go ahead and eat them be eights I'm already very different very sweet probably 10 years ago but I love these not too sure how I feel about them right now they definitely have a cake that tincture is kick in we will be making some gummies from scratch I won't that will be way up goodies and that will be coming very soon in the meantime it has been a pleasure hope you guys enjoy the recipe let me know if you have any questions my comment subscribe do all that good stuff so have a good one everybody stay safe hope you've enjoyed your quarantine here but you know Rona V out there coming for all of us alright have a good one peace [Music]", "TGXiiOxENXw": "what's up everybody so I know it's been a minute since I've done a video or you know anything really I mean I'm kind of live in hectic here lately I was dating this girl and oh that was a rough ride I'll tell you what man so yeah it's just been kind of crazy here lately haven't really been able to afford to buy new veep's stuff or try a new tape stuff out but uh today I'm gonna I'm gonna do something different I'm gonna module review and reviews it's gonna be on the they're called stoner patch dummies they're THC gummies yeah I live here in Illinois marijuana's legal here in Illinois now so I'm gonna do this little review on these gummies there's strawberry flavors 350 milligrams so there's 70 milligrams each I'm just gonna take a half of one because I'm not much a pothead these days you know how I was when I was a kid every teenager getting [ __ ] stoned all the damn time [Music] I'm gonna actually clean it sober for almost three years now so I really don't find marijuana to be a drug though I think it's more of a more of a medicine than anything I'd seem to do a lot of good for a lot of people so yeah go ahead sorry about this no I'm telling ya I've done some gummies before and you can definitely tell them you know if you if you get a gummy from anybody I'm telling you you'll know if it's THC or not because they smell like weed it smells like weed this is what they look like they're just little strawberries so I already got the half of one ready they got little that sugar you know just like Groening regular dummy so it tastes good what they also doesn't taste the weed so when I was a teenager if you would ever told me that one of these days you'd be able to buy these just normal mmm about a LifeCare job I mean I went to prison for something me about 15 years ago I was told that I can go up to a courthouse and get that charge expunged but I mean I got another charge too and I don't want to look at the county all right so yeah they just saw it just tastes like you can smell it so if you ever go out you buy some and order if you want to know if they're real or not smell it if you smell it I am let's novena you know you got the real thing they don't smell like we they do smell like gummies you know sweet candy most likely the their CBD gummies or theirs guys you ripped off if you cannot smell the we don't buy them so all right well I'm gonna pause this video and I'll come back in about 30 minutes and let you know how it's gone from there see you guys in a minute oh we're about 30 minutes in and really don't feel anything yet so alright never got around doing it but uh I got the new vapor s so Jen so everybody's making such a big deal about it I mean it's a it's a really good mod I mean it's good solid mod it's really really light I mean that's what I like about its light as hell but yeah I mean there's nothing fancy about it or anything but it is a good mind really wrong but I don't know what the big fuss is about you know there's nothing fancy about it I got the off necks mesh tank on there got the I think it's the point two coils a giant monster peanut-butter-and-jelly the great woman", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "Oke0eNMVtrY": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm just showing you how to make infused super sour candy spray is so good I'm so obsessed with it and I'm so excited to show you guys how to make this these turned out so amazing they're so delicious they literally my favorite thing ever my favorite thing I've made my everything empty so they're just like they're just so good so I'm doing a couple different versions including some sugar-free and so much sugar I thought this sugar-free one might not taste as good as well as sugar because of course it's sugar-free but I honestly cannot even tell it's like it literally tastes like real sugar which is weird might be because of all the sour in there it kind of like throws your tastebuds off or something but it's absolutely amazing and it has no calories except with coconut oil yes actually and I'm going to show you guys how to emulsify coconut oil into a spray and they stay like this they don't um separate now if you don't want to follow the instructions for the emulsification of the mixture you don't have to you could just do the flavoring with coconut oil um and just shake it every time you use it it'll still work but if you want to keep them so they look like this all the time I'll show you guys how in the video the texture is a little bit different for the one with the sugar versus the sugar free the sugar free one is more liquidy and the one with sugar is a little bit more like the kind you get in the store so it has more of a syrupy texture I mean that one extra sourdough made then I did use coconut oil in mine but you don't need to I just added to help with the absorption if you choose not to use coconut oil just try to use your spray when you're eating something fatty or take like a soy lecithin pill or something along those lines here's what you're going to need a variety of drink flavors or flavor oils some infuse coconut oil or regular coconut oil tincture if desired water granulated sugar citric acid potassium sorbate mixture exams and gum and some spray bottles start by taking your infused coconut oil and melt it in the microwave until it's liquid our first step is to make our base for our sprays so we do want to add some fat to our sprays but unfortunately oil and water do not mix so we're gonna make an emulsion using water exams and gum and infuse coconut oil you could also use regular coconut oil but if you can up the infusion for this I say why not so we have 1/3 of a cup of water and 1/4 TSP of exams and gum this is what the exams and gum and water mixture should look like after blending it now I'm gonna add in two tablespoons of my melted infused coconut oil and then we're gonna blend that together alright here's how it looks and it's too thick so I ended up having to add it some more water to this so I added 1/3 of a cup more water and left everything else the same so if I were to do this again I would do 1/3 of a cup of water 1/4 teaspoon of example gum or possibly maybe just 1/8 of a teaspoon but I would only do 1 tablespoon of coconut oil now that I added water it definitely looks a lot better I'm just gonna have quite a bit left over now I'm gonna add 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below and this is going to preserve your sprays so that they can last for months now I'm going to pour my mixture into my little spray bottles I believe they are 30 milliliters spray bottles and I'm gonna just fill them about less than half of the bottle I mean you can play around with how much you want of this it just kind of affects the texture but if you added more that would work as well the amount of mixture I have is enough for probably six or more bottles now we're going to start with our first spray which is the sour blue raspberry I want mine to be extra strong so I'm also going to be putting some tincture in here I put about 10 of these syringes I don't know but I think equals about a tablespoon you can add more you can add less you can add none it's up to you I could have added more but I didn't want to have too much of an alcohol taste now we're gonna add in our flavoring I'm gonna be using these kool-aid sugar-free flavor packages but you could use regular kool-aid or you could use a flavoring oil it's really up to whatever flavor you would like I'm just using one package but you could use more if you want a stronger taste now to add our citric acid which is going to make our mouth spray sour I'm only going to be adding in one teaspoon of citric acid because this drink mix already has citric acid in it you could use as much or as little citric acid as you like but I would recommend not using any more than three teaspoons of citric acid as I think that would be too sour even for somebody who really does like sour and as you can see I'm really struggling getting the citric acid to go through the funnel and that is because it is wet so I suggest either cleaning it and drying it before you pour anything through that's powdery or to put the citric acid into your containers before you use the funnel with any liquids now I'm just gonna fill the rest of my container up with some water and as you can see I over fill it so just keep a nice eye on how much water you're adding there to add less than have to add a little bit more after then you can shake it all up until everything is all mixed together and you can see it has perfectly emulsified oh never mind there's some clumps in there so with the clumps if you guys can see them on camera I tried to be able to get them but they weren't showing up very well if you get clumps in there it's because the flavor packet was not dissolving properly and that's likely because I use cold water so I just do this in the microwave for about 30 seconds with the lid off and as you can see it's perfect I have a very smooth nice texture now our next one which is the sour watermelon I'm going to be using this Jolly Rancher watermelon drink packet of course you can use a regular couid packet flavoring oil like I said you can really use anything that your heart desires now we're going to add our 1 teaspoon of strick acid as well as the flavoring packet then I'm just gonna give it a quick little mix and then I am going to add some more tincture to this again you don't have to add tincture this is just a personal choice to make my spray stronger now we're just going to fill the rest of the bottle up with some water this time I use warm water and then we're going to shake it up real nice and that's it this one is done and ready to use so now we've made our sugar free watermelon and our sugar free blue raspberry now we're gonna make one with sugar which is going to be our sour green apple spray the first step to making the sugar spray is to mix equal parts water and sugar so I have 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sugar and I'm going to bring that to a boil and once it comes to a boil I am going to let it cook for another 2 minutes about and then I'm going to take it off the heat once it's off the heat I'm going to add in my flavoring and I am using a kool-aid package I didn't really know how much I was going to need so I just threw the whole pack in there you could use more you could use less again all down to taste but the 1 pack works well for this and of course you could also use a flavoring oil instead then we're just going to mix that all in until it's nice and smooth and evaporated absorbed I'm not sure this is all this the word that I'm looking for so you're going to stir this until all of the powder has been dissolved you can also add the citric acid in at this point I didn't I don't know why I just didn't but it would be easier if you added it in at this point then you can add in your sugar water kool-aid mixture into your jar with the base mixture of coconut oil water it sounds and gum so yeah just pour that right in and then we're going to add our teaspoon of citric acid and like I said it would have been easier had you just done this and while it was still in the pot but that's the really nice thing about making these sprays as they're very very very flexible the only thing you want to be a little bit careful with is making that emulsion mixture that is the base of each of them to bind that oil and water together now I'm just adding some tincture in here it is a unmeasured amount I'm just going for it here now we'll give it a nice little shake and mix it up until it is all finded this one you can already kind of tell when shaking and it has a bit of a different texture from that simple syrup sugar mixture speaking of which you could also use a few simple syrup in this recipe so you can see there's so many ways to do this so I tried it and it was super tasty but I felt like I wanted it more sour like I like it so sour that almost hurts my face so I added in a another teaspoon of citric acid and it turned out perfectly it's so sour and so delicious and the sugary taste of it is like even better than the other ones not gonna lie so I want to show you guys what they look like when they come out and the difference in texture between the sugar-free and the not sugar-free so this red one here is a sugar-free one and it tastes really good I was worried that the sugar-free ones were going to have a like meth taste because they were sugar-free but they were like really really good I almost wouldn't know they weren't sugar-free if no one had told me so but the sugar one has a very different texture and it's more like syrupy a reminds me of when you buy a sort of a candy sour spray from the store it kind of has that same mouthfeel but they're both very very good and I'm not gonna lie to you guys I have to suck this out of a paper towel after I just couldn't waste it thank you guys so much for watching I am so excited about these they're so good please tell me if you make them because I want to hear what flavor combinations and everything that he did and also thinking of doing a mint flavored one without sugar obviously it's better fruity and I don't know like maybe like a Mexican maybe like a spicy one I don't know what do you guys think what would you like to see it we got there so good I'm gonna dicted to this I named a green apple one of my favorite but I love a green apple thank you guys so so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave comment and subscribe thanks guys [Music]", "BpKYde5BXHI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to turn regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this

her up and I like hold her for a while we kept going back to houses I noticed she started getting sleepy I was like okay maybe it's time to call it a night after trick-or-treating shantel went to give Delilah a bath Delilah was limp and not responsive I started freaking out and everyone was telling me she's just really tired she's okay like she's not okay this is not her this this can't be her and then I've told them I need to go to the hospital there's something's wrong with her Chantal took Delilah to UMC and doctors ran a bunch of tests tests came back they're like there's THC in her system

of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500

sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "yK4OR0yt0rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah P and welcome back to the haze today I'm coming at you with another edible review today we're gonna be doing the spicy chamoy sweeter high gummy is now sweeter hi is a company I believe based in California they do a lot of different products I think they do like vaporizers edibles so on and so on on their website I couldn't find too much information on them specifically but they say they specialize in high quality lead which I think all these companies do anyway at this point these guys are the 300 milligrams on the packaging and it does not tell you which how much milligrams is in each candy strip which is the hard part but on the back to tell you the nutrition it has lots of sugar so if that's something that concerns you be aware of that but they are very very delicious let's just go into opening them they have one of these on them not one of those child safety loved ones again they don't tell you how much milligrams they're in each strip but here is one of the strips now I personally don't like sour candies I don't have a high tolerance for sours but if you do you will absolutely love them they're very similar sour points you like sour patch kids those aren't these are for you I'm sure these are gonna be good the spiciness too is also not overwhelming and if you're not really into spice this won't really hurt you it's gonna be like comparable to like those little sweet Mexican candies with the spice around it those those are the most similar to these other than the sour being like obviously really overwhelming for me this flavor on these guys are really really good I haven't tried the other flavors but the spicy and the sweet the combination is super super nice the high so for me from those guys you do get high I wanted to say that it feels like 300 milligrams I ate an entire pack of these in one day and it felt like probably like a hundred and fifty so I don't know who does their testing but yeah it's definitely if you're looking for 300 milligrams this will be a little bit of a fall short but if you're looking for 150 labeled 300 this is for you it was not overwhelming high either I didn't get those little butterflies feelings in my tummy I just started a little giggly I'm always feeling the loose and then I fell asleep which is a thing I gotta say about edibles they will make you knock out I fell asleep like 7 p.m. and woke up at 11 so if you want to sleep these are a great sleep aid honestly um I don't know why they didn't get me super high and just made me sleepy usually both come together but I don't know maybe way to hit me or maybe it was what I was doing that day but yes these will make you sleep won't make you get extremely high won't make you get paranoid will make you get in your head but if you're looking sleep these guys are a great option also for smell wise in my last standing a video a lot of people are wondering about the smell I get no THC flavor no THC smell but if you're looking for something and that can be really hot on the low somebody can take in public something that you're afraid someone might smell it in your backpack person like that you won't get this with this this you don't smell any THC no oil nothing even in the flavor you couldn't you couldn't tell the difference between this and a regular candy to be honest so yeah if I was you and I saw these guys at the dispensary it's 300 milligrams I got these for 15 bucks I would get because oh I I'll be honest a lot of these kind of packaging a lot of these kind of candies I don't pick up when I see they don't seem to hit very well for me they always seem to be disappointing but these guys were actually something I have now revisited this is the second time I bought it and I didn't I don't regret it I think they're they're they're fun so if you want something a little bit different you're tired of cushy punches you're tired of lemonade's you're tired of the whole shebang you guys see the speeder hire any other gummies I'm sure they're all the same I would pick it up so again my name is Sara P thank you so much for watching the haze please follow us at our Instagram at the haze channel also hit that subscribe button on our YouTube please leave a comment below let me know if there's an edible you want me to review I will go out and find it so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you next time [Music] [Music]", "1zZV8VnNShI": "okay fellow youtubers this is DM Blair wolf and today's video is gonna be on this tiny little green lollipop well I was at the Harrisburg East Mall yesterday and a friend of mine Ted owns the supplemental store east coast supplements in there and he got these they're called chronic Tandy what it is is it's got ten milligrams of CBD and it has o G cush terpenes in it so it's an all-around wellness candy okay but as small as it is in this little city CBD it has in it I think it might be more geared towards like little kids maybe for like seizures or or a DD or even just wellness in some way because ten milligrams isn't a lot for an adult I would think cuz I personally need it probably the whole case of pops to be okay because I think it comes with like twenty or so in a case so I would probably need two or three hundred milligrams of this stuff but we're gonna open it up we're gonna try it out and see what it tastes like and see if we can get any you wouldn't get any wellness out of it okay so just give me a moment I'll rip this sucker open and we'll see what's in it cheers pop first off Wow I smells like an OG plant rate right allogram holy moly doesn't seem to be any low chunkies or anything yet so I guess it's just straight candy that's like flavor right off that's like you stuck the whole plant right in your mouth holy moly [Music] it tastes good yeah yeah I think it tastes great there's definitely terpenes in it you can taste them right off the candy itself has room it was sort of a like a sweet flavor to it I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel something well I was gonna get to that I actually even though it's only 10 milligrams I definitely feel calmer and that was just a little lick that I did well or someone who doesn't ingest or take CBD in a lot the sights a little bit could probably be you know you'll probably be beneficial do you like calming or making you are relaxed be another thing like your kids run around the house bouncing off the walls like a Gibbon throwing Legos everywhere you've been one of these little pops be like your kid you know son daughter child have a lollipop it's definitely appeasing in flavor I mean like the more I eat it the more I want to eat it I mean totally is when I was a kid I probably just want to ask for another that like definitely is like peanuts chronic candy is that it definitely has a a sense of appeal in its flavor okay like I can say that like if I were to take like marijuana or so forth and put it in my mouth I would be like this definitely has flavor and I could say that when you do it if you don't continuously lick it it goes away like I felt something but now because I ain't continuously doing it yeah it's not doing anything anymore yeah you probably have to ingest a whole pot like it's supposed to be one dose but one does for who wonder what type of people would benefit from this like I said like maybe like people with seizures because CBD supposed to be great for seizures and focusing concentrating relaxation just watch them move like children it's a pop yeah ten milligrams I feel it but I don't think it'll last long not for me cuz I'm you know kids like fifth my size it'd probably be like hey I'm ready to watch Sesame Street hey bring on the spongebob I'm ready for cartoons is it snack time yet so let's go through our daily thing here first we'll say that one one two five one being and five being presentation what it looks like what definitely looks appealing ain't a person in the world unlike a pop so due to four and a half it was a little bit bigger around maybe a five because then it'd be more appealing flavor would it taste like right off the bat man it's like you put the whole plant in your mouth so I give this sucker a five color I'm not so big on the color could have been yellow like a lemon maybe put some kind of flavor in it just not just strength terpenes in the CBD but you definitely know it's in there effectiveness I feel it I don't feel it like like when I used like the flowery products like the CBD blunt or the bubble bag hash and that's a BAM in your face you're you know I'm medicated this is just an underlining feeling that definitely is calming and medically it's good so those three things combined and the price is nice um I was giving this one for free to try it but if I remember correctly on the box here were like two bucks apiece I think I think there was like 10 or 20 in the box and he had like two or three more boxes you could just maybe buy a whole box for 20 bucks or something it's probably gonna be a big deal especially for since I work here at that new Nannan it's [ __ ] stressful working in there sometimes cuz there's definitely a cultural gap so being able to calm down and being able to focus yeah I'm sterile these are your mouth at work no probably never know I know so if you have any questions or comments if you've tried these before or you know a different flavor or a different company or a place where you can Vicki's wholesale or even ones that are stronger 20 I think a 50 milligram one of these would definitely be more adult in a in a in a dose cuz I know when you buy just like the hemp bombs those pills are like three pills for 60 milligrams total you take all three of them pills you know you took them so if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down below thumbs up like subscribe comment comment comment meanwhile while you're commenting I'm gonna finish this lollipop so till next time guys have a great calming relaxing medicated day", "8OnpLbjLC6w": "so it looks like they sent me every flavor of their sour punch boys okay check these out we have watermelon blue raspberry rainbow which is like a tropical fruit punch and a fruit punch actually this is fruit punch this is rainbow whatever that means all right so you guys want to check out these warheads i'll get that up and close for you [Music] wow what should we try today you guys i kind of okay i'm [ __ ] scared of these but that's what makes it more dangerous i kind of want to try it now you know like this if you think i should try the warheads comment if you think i should try one of the sour punch boys no i'm kind of curious you know what i think i'm going to open both of them up and we're going to see what we have going on with both of them so without further ado let's get it [Music] they smell good can you guys get a good look at those there's no entire way to be accurate with edibles i feel like when you know different vendors and stuff so what i like to do is what they teach you in medical school is to count your items and divide your milligrams by the number of items so let's count we have one two three four five six seven eight nine and i just beat the tenth piece 10 divided by 500 is 50 yes so i would assume if these were rightfully dosed that of every piece of these is 50 milligrams okay go from there so let me tell you what that tastes like the blue raspberry tastes delicious first off um i am tasting a little bit of thc [Music] [Music] [Music] so good blue raspberry delicious all right now next what we have for you is the sour medicated warheads now i think this is a prank i think they knew that i was gonna try this and so they were like let's send this [ __ ] the sourest candies they have so here i go everybody christmas god please don't let me make the ugliest faces on youtube

everything means the most to me i'm just a little lady who likes edibles thank you so much [Music]", "cXkpjapBxnM": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at another product from milk-and-cookies the terribly neighborhood still have the price tag on it $10 you can see there go ahead and take that off milk and cookies the weirdly named and even weird early logoed edibles we are taking a look at their 20 dose which means 200 milligram red velvet cookie will read the terrible description on the back and then we'll dig into the review here okay so here's what they say sink your teeth into a satin red velvet cookie Edurne adorned with swirls of buttercream frosting and sprinkled with sugary bling each velvety bite reveals sweet silky buttercream atop a decadent red pillow go ahead lick the frosting my first we won't tell who sultry sexy now I've got my scissors here because L edible this packaging is terrible and for whatever reason does not actually include a way to open it without scissors I think that's a terrible decision a design decision of mine but you know that's what they have decided so Milton that these guys I reviewed quite a few products from them I find them to be mixed too bad for the confectionary edibles some of the things are okay like they're [ __ ] brownie and their regular brownie I found to be okay but most of their 200 milligram cookies or their rice krispies treats do not seem to get me where I want to be but they are reasonably priced so this is a $10 cookie which is a good deal for a 200 milligram edible if it were as potent as a 200 milligram edible should or could be alright so for whatever reason this cookie a little smushed too so I brought the patented wheats plate here to dump it out on I think it was purchased smushed but you know smush just one way of eating something it's just you know oh jeez it's really banged up alright so that's a knock against it is how easily this thing gets banged up so there is all the cookie the red velvet cookie all banged and crumbed up let's give it a bite so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way we do our reviews is I'm gonna eat some of this cookie I'll eat the whole thing I just don't abort you to death by eating it all in front of you hidden camera but I'm gonna eat it all over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review is not the way it tastes but how it makes you feel so let's go ahead and get a smell and taste test here no real discernible weed odor what's mmm that is better than I thought it was going to be then it's not bad and I'm not even a huge red velvet fan but that's pretty good well no we taste whatsoever or if there isn't it's masked by the cookie and the buttercream frosting buttercream frosting is good very neutral sort of taste and the cookie itself is very moist very soft and delicious I like it but as I just said who can't outrace well I care how it tastes you should care how it tastes too but well you should really care about is how it makes you feel and for that guys I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thank you so much for watching wheats I'll see you soon I'm back my friends it has been two hours since I had the MILF and cookies 200 milligram red velvet cookie and it's a pleasant little surprise I I liked it I am enjoying it um it's not great but compared to the other milk and cookies 200 milligram urse I think this is my favorite it tastes surprisingly good I was really surprised with how good it tastes and I'm um I'm not high out of my mind but I'm pretty high average n for a 200 milligrams so tastes good and above our writer average I would say high for a 200 milligram uh would not be my first choice I I would probably spend a little bit of extra money and go with a similar thing product from Korova or canna Co similar milligram egde but I don't think you're gonna be dissatisfied with the milk and cookies red velvet cookie if you happen to pick one up and if you're a huge fan of red velvet definitely give it a go you'll you'll love the taste and you'll find yourself uh pleasantly hi so this is a thumbs up from me it's again it's not fantastic it's not the best I've ever had but it is better than a lot of the other milk and cookies so if you see it under dispensary near you and you like red velvet go for it it's a good edible alright guys thank you so much for watching that's going to do on this review here on weeks thank you for watching again and we will check you out on the next review piece okay one hello
