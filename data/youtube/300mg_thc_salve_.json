{"QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and thanks very much well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from GMA every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA", "0_0gj6pZVnQ": "SAY INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD\nCOVER THE COSTS, SO WE\u2019D LIKE TO COVER THE COSTS, SO WE\u2019D LIKE TO\nHEAR FROM YOU IF IT WORKS FOR HEAR FROM YOU IF IT WORKS FOR\nYOU.

part of the cannabis plant and the healing benefits that you can gain from that I want to start today with a showing you some products these are topical creams and these creams come in regular strength and extra strength and then I also have a CBD cooling stick so I want to show you some options for healing if you have joint or muscle pain particularly arthritis or if you have sore muscles from your workouts or any other thing you twisted your ankles or a carpal tunnel syndrome for example anything where your joints or your muscles have been affected and you're looking for a non-prescription and non-medicated type of cream or non-pharmaceutical I should say this is plant medicine and I'm going to just simply show you how this is used this is extra strength and the extra strength comes in a little container like this and and really speaking you just apply it like any other cream if I have a little bit of soreness around my joints so I'm gonna take this extra strength and rub it in and generally speaking I feel the relief in about 15 minutes or so and I like to do this in the morning first thing in the morning and then I also do this at the end of the day just before I'm getting into bed you could apply to three times a day in order to feel the soothing effect over the course of the entire day it depends on your schedule depends on how often you want to use the cream but this one works really well you can see that it's not very greasy it's not - it's easy to absorb into the skin and if goes on really nice and there's no scent on this at all so this is an option if you've got joint or muscle pain this is an extra strength CBD cream healing balm so that you can heal topically the other option if you're experiencing inflammation so let's say you have an injury and it's a it's a it's a pain that feels inflamed so there's a bruise it's feeling warm to the touch the other option is to take cooling stick and so this cooling stick you apply it it's in the shape of a deodorant and you take the stick cover off roll it up a little bit and then apply this to your skin and you'll feel a cooling relief almost immediately and then this one also includes a little bit of the smell of peppermint so using regular essential oils this has a cooling effect and also a great way to work through any topical pain so the option is here rather than to go for something from the pharmacy or from the drugstore is to take mother nature's course first is to apply a little bit of plant medicine notice how it feels this I've seen also my clients use if they've experienced some tenderness or soreness after they've done a yoga class and they come out and they have applied some of this cream and in to great effect so I wanted to share that option with you if you're looking to purchase some of these you can click the link below and you'll have access to all of the different products that are available and remember this is CBD so there's no psychoactive effect you won't feel hi this is on your skin and a great way to leverage what we know about plant medicine is that it works very intuitively with your everyone has a different kind of healing benefit and it might just be the next best thing for you happy to help and if you have any questions please leave that here underneath the video and subscribe and like and do your practices about thank you setting um Salima and we're signing off now watch for video number three and four coming up next", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a tupperware [Music] container [Music] if you enjoyed this video or found it at all helpful be sure to hit that like

we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused a body lotion for moisturizing your skin and also for pain relief also very happy to announce that we have a new scripted comedy series coming up called higher beings please stick around to the end of the video and learn how you can support that project on IndieGoGo now let's get started here's what you need to make cannabis infused body lotion you need a quarter cup of cannabis infused cocoa butter 1/4 cup of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of light oils such as light olive oil and you also need 10 to 20 drops of essential oils for flavoring such as lemon oil mint tea tree oil eucalyptus you can also use some infused coconut oil and place of the cocoa butter in this recipe and then you could also use oil that's been infused with the herbal infuser and you can save $30 on the air blown fuse with a code ruffhouse at herbal infuser calm now let's talk a little about how you can infuse the actual cocoa butter now we've done this recipe a couple of times recently so but I'm gonna go over it real briefly again but basically you grind your cannabis and in this case you don't actually have to decarbonize effects it's time for the other cannabinoids that are in the cannabis and you do not have to actually activate this and you can do some research to find which level of activation you might need to relieve the certain type of pain that you have too but for this case you don't actually have to decarboxylate or activate your cannabis and then you're going to infuse the oil for about one to two hours and when you're done the cocoa butter is going to be a lot darker and if you let it harden it'll harden back up and it melts very easily on your skin temperatures enough to melt it and you can see there it's it's very slick oil and it's I got a lot of moisturizing value for your skin so that's where we're going to be using for a basis for our oil so whether that's melted or not if you just made it and it still melted you you don't really need to melt it anymore but we're gonna go ahead and put that in a heat safe dish that you can put into a double boiler you could use like a canning jar there and we're not gonna actually boil the water we're just barely keeping it just under the it's gonna board just with a little bubble start to go and like I said you could also use cannabis infused coconut oil if you would rather use that instead of infusing the cocoa butter so it's up to you which one of those you infuse or you could infuse both if you want a really really strong but it being so this is not something edible it probably is a waste to try to make it too strong because you're not really going for the THC and you might also use a strong CBD strain or another kind of strain for this depending on your needs for this kind of lotion ok we're also going to take the shea butter and we're taking the other light oil that we're using in this case we're using olive oil a light olive oil and we're combining all of the other ingredients except for the essential oils into our double boiler or into our heat proof dish inside of a hot water bath until it's all melted and once it's all melted and combined you can take that and switch it into a mixing bowl it's gonna be large enough to use a hand and executed and then at that point you can also as the oil is cooling and cooled off a little bit you can add in your essential oils and in this case it's up to you if you add any oils because you could just leave it as it is and it'll have a slightly chocolaty smell because of the cocoa butter but this part is definitely up to your preferences and also for what you use you're using it for if you're using it as an everyday moisturizer you probably don't want to make it very strong smelling or it's gonna overpower your perfume or cologne or whatever or just be overpowering in general but if you're making it for medicinal purposes you might use a lot of mint or eucalyptus or the things that would give it that minty or that medicinal feel and now you're going to put it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes until the bowl gets cold or whatever and you start to see that it's just beginning to thicken a little bit so just when the the viscosity starts to thicken some and that's when you're gonna do this step here and that is to take your hand mixer on high and just keep mixing and mixing as you're whipping in air it's gonna turn lighter and lighter and you do that for three or four minutes until it quits turning lighter and by that time it'll be finished and then you put it back in the refrigerator to harden and then at that point you could also pour it into a containers because it'd be a lot easier while it's still a liquid and then after it hardens and sets in refrigerator you bring it out of the refrigerator at at room temperature it becomes a very soft subtle lotion that you can rub into your skin very easily it really has no real expiration date as long as you keep it sealed keep it out of the light and it's great for pain relief as well it helped me with my psoriasis on the bottom of my foot with a moisture so check that out also check out higher beings this is a new project I'm really excited about and if you're really interested you could help us support that by checking out Andy gogo I'll put links in the description and on the screen here so please check that out it's a new scripted comedy series that we're looking forward to trying out here at Roth house Studios but we need your help I hope you enjoyed this episode on how to make pain relief lotion with cannabis if you did please hit the like button and subscribe to roughhouse Studios for more cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from ruff house studios thank you for watching [Music]", "FymCTaaSMDY": "my name is Willie Christie and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "L0UpRHIowog": "[Music] hi welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back I really appreciate your support it does mean the world to me and it's growing and growing I'm so excited I like Wow but anyway so today I'm going to show you two how to do a topical for pain relief using an infused coconut oil and some hocus pocus and to know some essential oils and that put together and this stuff works amazing I use it all the time now I absolutely love it I have a rare genetic disorder called ehlers-danlos syndrome and it's a connective tissue disorder which my body doesn't produce collagen so as my tendons and ligaments stretch out they don't go back so all of my joints are very very loose and although my muscles are constantly sore because they're constantly fighting to hold my joints in place so yeah it's a whole thing but anyway so I've used this and it has been great for inflammation my shoulders and everything so I really wanted to show you how to do it and I hope you do get the sigh of relief from it as well so um I don't think I have anything else to go there I'm gonna get into the as I normally do I'm gonna get into the ingredients and then the directions on how to do it alright well thank you for joining me so these are bombs that I made up earlier so this one is like a bomb like a waxy bomb and this one when we whip it chill it and whip it and multiply it it ends up a lighter or a lighter feel and a lighter texture so it all depends on your preference on what you what you like on your skin I tend to use both so what you're going to need for this is two tablespoons of your infused coconut oil 2 ounces of cocoa butter and you want it to be unrep yer 100% pure unrefined cocoa butter so you don't want anything done to it you want to pure unrefined same thing with the shea butter it's going to be 1 ounce of shea butter and you're use all-natural raw unrefined two tablespoons of all natural beeswax pellets and then we're going to get into our essential oils so for tumeric which is great for the anti-inflammatory as well and so tumeric you can get in a tincture which I've got here you can use it in its spice form but if you use it in its spice form it will be kind of gritty you can also get it in an essential oil unfortunately don't have the essential oil and you can also get it in capsules and it is still powdered form but it's really really fine so I like using this because you really don't feel it at all so that's what I use versus the versus the spice itself then the essential oils that I like to use and I put a list of the description of exactly what each of them do and you can choose which one's work best for you you can eliminate on any other choice you can just pick a few or all but I like this combination I found it works awesome for for inflammation so I've got the tumeric tincture I like I use spearmint eucalyptus lemongrass tea tree frankincense vetiver and lavender and the other thing you want to use is what's called a carrier oil and you could use grapeseed oil sweet almond oil castor oil I think avocado oil I believe is another one and what carrier oils do is you're gonna add your essential oils into the carrier oil before we add it in into our mixture and the reason is is essential oils can be very harsh on the skin and the first time I made it I figured well all this stuff's oily why do I need to add that so I just did it without it and it did I found it made me very itchy but when I add it to the grapeseed oil which they call as a carrier oil for them you I found that there I didn't have any itching at all so that is now what I do so I'll go over all those steps just a moment and then just for your equipment you're just gonna need a double boiler and you just want to use the potty Bowl that you're gonna be keep your stuff in and a spatula or a wooden spoon and also tapioca starch in is an option for you if you would like it helps to make it not so greasy so if you don't like a greasy feeling on your bombs or creams then you can looking at in the tapioca which I really like so depending on how much you can bury again it's I use about a quarter of a cup but again you can test it out and see what feels better for your skin oops yes I'm crushing all right so I'm just gonna get all this cleaned up and we'll put all of our ingredients together alright so the first thing you just set up your double boiler add your water it's important to make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you can put that in and you're gonna set your heat to medium to medium-low higher higher to the medium side and we're gonna add in our two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil our two ounces of pure unrefined cocoa butter one ounce of shea butter and our two tablespoons of wax pellets beeswax pellets I use pure organic and you're gonna just kind of mix that in and wait for that to start melting and yeah it's not a whole lot to it so we're just gonna I said let that melt and have everything come together now it's very important do not turn up your heat you want to do it slowly it is very easy to burn any one of these components so you definitely want to melt it slowly over that medium-low heat as it begins to melt you just want to continue to mix periodically mix things so that you're bringing the heated stuff from the bottom up to the to the top and distributing the warm over the coal getting everything melted a little bit quicker and then while our little mixture a little concoction here is melting we can get our essential oils ready okay so you're gonna start with two tablespoons of your carrier oil whichever you decided I use grapeseed the grapeseed oil it's a good neutral good for all skin types it absorbs easily into the skin and yeah but as I said you can find maybe one that works better for your skin if you've got skin issues or yeah the sensitivity or things like that you may find one of the other ones that work better for you so you're gonna add two tablespoons of that and so it said this is my concoction you guys can said kind of do what works better for you this is what I put together that I said that I found really works great for inflammation and a little as well as a lot of my friends have tried it and it has worked really great so I use about one milliliter of the tumeric tincture and then I use one of the capsules of the 3050 milligrams of tumeric the one nice thing about using the capsules is you know exactly how much you're using you just open that up put that in and then I use spearmint as I said if you look in the description you'll find a full explanation to each the essential oils as to why I use them and I use about 20 drops of spearmint and eucalyptus is really good for your inflammation as well and muscle pain and I use about 30 drops of this and if anyone's really actually counting and there's a comment about oh there was 32 I don't want to hear it and lemongrass is awesome plus it smells really nice and again I use about 30 drops of this and then I use tea tree and the reason for the tea tree is it acts as a nice ant is an antiseptic so it takes care of any issues on your skin as well so it is it it helps like I said if it's got any kind of open lose or blemishes or things like that it will help us with that as well and being an antiseptic and I used about 15 drops of this and then ten drops of frankincense whoops that comes out quick stop's expensive too and the vet vetiver now this stuff is really really sick so it doesn't come out of the dropper we got to be very careful well I have to be careful most other people don't and I'm gonna use about ten drops of this and another good one for our skin although I don't like it I don't add it because I hate the smell of lavender but lavender is a great option as well it's a very relaxing and soothing for the muscles but as I said I don't like it don't really find much for me personally I'd anyway again personal option I hate the smell of lavender and then we're just gonna mix all those together now that all your butters and oils are melted here you're just gonna turn your heat down to low and you're just gonna leave it on for a bow we're gonna leave it on for about 20 minutes this is just to make sure everything comes up to the exact same temperature and everything is fully blended and melted together okay I apologize sorry my Stoner gapping move here the tumeric capsule if you use the capsules do not put it into the essential oils so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna just strain that out you're gonna use the capsule put the capsule into the into your shea butter and cocoa butter mixture so I'm just gonna fix that up here by watch it go straighter stop putting a piece of cheesecloth I doubled it up and applauding it into a small strainer all this stuff is very expensive so I don't want to waste it so now this isn't going to hurt the anything I'm just removing the chunks in there that we don't really want in a cream and then I'm going to add the capsule into the end of the oil okay so I'm going to add the tumeric capsule into the shea butter and cocoa butter and our beeswax that's where it's supposed to go and you just want to get a whisk a little whisk if you've got one and just whisk that in alright so our mixture has been sitting on the warm on the hot water there for about 20 minutes you're just gonna take it off and you're gonna let it sit on the counter until it cools down a little bit we don't want to add the essential oils when it's really hot because that will it'll burn off on the essential parts of the essential oils so we want to let that cool down a little bit before we're gonna add in the oils for about 5-10 minutes just check the bottom of your bowl if it's just warm to the touch then we're good but if it still feels hot wait a little bit so that feels good so now we're going to take a Nadder and add in our essential oils and you're gonna get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that in alright so here you got some options if you just want a waxy balm you can go ahead and pour it into your containers like this if you would like to take away some of the grease enos of it you can add in the tapioca starch so I'm gonna add in a quarter cup and you're gonna whisk that in again the tapioca is optional I like it though it makes it feel a lot nicer you just use a spatula to get anything off the sides I just continue to whisk whisk that until it is all known all all smooth sorry you want it nice and smooth like that so as I said if you just want to have a bomb then you can go ahead and pour it into your containers I'm gonna do a little bit of both I'm gonna do poor part one so the poor one is a bomb and then show you how to emulsify and make it a lighter texture so I'm just gonna pour the liquid just doesn't do it I'm just doing a bomb and I pour that let that set up and now you're just gonna let these you're gonna let this sit on the counter until it partially solidifies so we're going to wait for it to solidify about halfway and then we're going to start the beating process now this will solidify fairly quickly because of all of what the Watts that we have in it but less wax you use the longer it's going to take to to solidify now you can put it into the refrigerator to assist with it but it'll go fairly quickly like I said right now because we've got the wax up quite a bit of wax in there but if you do want to speed up the process you can definitely put it in the fridge for about three to five minutes but don't forget about it all right so you want your bomb now to be like this so you see how it's partially solidified here on the sides it's kind of solid but in the middle we're still liquidy and you're gonna get your hand mixer or blender or whisk you can use whoops and we are going to continue to mix this until it is all one homogeneous uniform factory [Music] all right so I'm just gonna let this sit again and let it solidify around the edges again and we're gonna repeat the process and each time we do you're gonna see the the product keep getting lighter and lighter all right so it's sort of quite a bit more on the sides there during your mixing process you can always test your bond to see how it feels and make sure that you like it for your texture so it's gonna be a lot more solid once it solidifies and sets however you want to see what it's actually gonna feel like just take a little bit rub it on the back of your hand and see how that feels so first it'll be a greasy L feel greasy but that tapioca you'll notice it'll start to nod not feel it and then you just want to work it in so it may be a little bit yellow on the skin but as you work it in that yellow will go away okay so I would just put it back into the freezer for about two minutes and I'm going to continue the process all right so you can see now that our pain balm is all one uniform texture we whatever we pull off the size is the exact same we're not getting any separation wax or anything like that and that's how you know that is fully blended there and it's gonna make a nice light bomb for you so now we're ready to pour it into our containers I just want to smack them down so they're nice and fun get out any air bubbles and that's it you can let them sit out on this counter for a couple of hours to fully set or you can put them into the fridge or the freezer to quicken that up and I'm gonna put these into the fridge probably for about a half an hour and then we'll all come back and we'll test it out right so my pain bombs here have set up and this was the one that I did just as wax and I didn't whip it up there and you can see it's darker my lighting is a little bit tough here to see it's pretty bright and then this one's a lot lighter so I said you can it'll just give you a little bit different texture totally up to you it's just a preference thing you're not gonna get any different benefits either way so we're just gonna give it a try here you see so you see how it goes on a little bit yellow and then you just work it in and there you go then you can see that grease enos it was first there at tapioca that's what takes that away so it just feels really nice on your skin as well and that's it so now you can make your own pain bombs at home without caught us thinking absolutely well not gonna lie it's a little bit expensive if you go with all those essential oils I highly recommend doing research on buying them your local if you go to your local health food store it's gonna cost you an absolute fortune I do recommend Amazon has great prices on essential oils a couple of things with regards to essential oils make sure that they are 100% essential oils and that they are pure that the other is that they're actually essential oils because you will also see essential oil fragrances and that is just extracting the fragrances from your different your different herbs and roots and same things so you want to make sure it's essential oils 100% pure and that's about all I can say with regards to that if you have any questions at all as always don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll always get back to you if you have anything else any suggestions or anything I'd love to hear from you other than that I hope you enjoyed the video and you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for watching [Music]", "ngWuODwllSs": "[Music] each CBD product that we carry comes with a standardized dosage the dosage of CBD for the oil that we carry is twenty milligrams per ml for a hundred and fifty pound person the daily dose of CBD is basically

and for anybody who weighs more than 150 pounds you can adjust the dosage upward [Music] you", "YnpyI03qRZw": "hey guys so this is kind of like a this is a kind of a fun blog for me to do this week and it kind of happened by accident so about three or so weeks ago you might remember that I went to this crazy crazy spa convention with my friend Hillary who is the the informal skin Carmo CEO and we it was at the Javits Center in New York which is this massive like blocks long Convention Center and so this spa convention had you know a slew of spa focused brands like so nage which is one of my favorite what this is one of my favorite masks ever is antioxidant mass is incredible so so not so nage is an la-based Spa skincare brand they operate in the spa Channel and they have their own their own spa where they perform medical grade facials and things like that and so I ran into the founder the CEO of so nage at the convention and got a facial and you know I posted that on my IG and it was amazing so there were and there was also the foreo team was there and you know how much I love that foreo UFO mask matter of fact I think I need to do that this afternoon it's been a bit of men like a week um so there were brands there that I knew and brands that I kind of collab with and like loved and then there were brands that I'd never heard of before there was there a slew of like fake French spa brands like these brands like with products and services and stuff that sound French like because these crazy French names and they have nothing to do with brands so they're so there were like two ends of the spectrum right like really serious like spa brands at this spa convention they're never kind of these fake ones and then somehow like and then there were all these high-tech things like these LED facials like we're going on and people are laying down with the LED like bright deep red Warren G red LED lights you know similar to the dr. gross device so there was that going on but then there were like interspersed throughout this huge like it was an arena was like an underground chamber I don't it was nuts there are several maybe a dozen or so CBD and half of brands and I don't necessarily see how they really fit into the spa channel but this this this whole thing honestly it wasn't limited to spa right like you could present whatever if you have products you present and people who are looking for that in theirs I guess in their in their spas would be down for you know trying out your products and maybe presenting your products in in their businesses but um so the funny thing about a lot of these CBD brands is they're like they're kind of like wacky sometimes like what if that packaging like who came up with that packaging who designed that packaging like I'm a packaging copywriter I pay attention to packaging I pay attention to product names and how you know how things look do they look hokey do they look like you know they were made in someone's kitchen which is all well and good but that's like a different thing to me DIY skincare um or do they look like legit brands like thought like well-thought-out brands and I guess I'm like everybody if a if a package is is beautiful I tend to believe that what's inside is is is good for me it is delicious this stuff is delicious um that it's reliable you know packaging is everything like I just I love the drunk elephant package design I think it's incredible that's part of it right in you know sometimes packaging is more medicinal looking or pharmaceutical like the skin suitable so it's pretty straightforward and undesigned looking you know so it's got a little bit of the platinum going on but that's about it this is an excellent sunscreen by the way both of these both of these are but so the thing with the CBD market is is it's new and all these CBD brands are new and they're coming to market and they're not necessarily sophisticated I guess that's really what I'm getting at is the brand sophisticated does it feel like like it's solid and trustworthy or does it feel kind of hokey and you know like Wild West and so I was wandering around I spotted Hillary and I came across this one brand called Hempfield botanicals and within their their presentation in their in their area in their designated area I met the founder of him co-founder of Hempfield botanical her name is Heather she and her husband I think his name is nathan founded this brand in pennsylvania in and around Lancaster and so it's a CBD brand and they make several categories of products so they have topical treatments like their staff their CBD salve which which helps to alleviate pain so the the CBD in here is isolated and focused on pain relief and I'm going to talk about that in a second this product actually smells quite amazing and I'm gonna tell you how I used it which is a little wacky they have tinctures tinctures are ingestible drops that you either drop under your tonic tongue if they're an oil tank sure if they're a water-based tincture you can mix them with a beverage you can mix them with a protein shake you can drip them in your tea the the oral tinctures that Hempfield offers are all oil-based so you you drip these under your tongue and kind of hold them there for a bit and and and the CBD and the other components in the formula get infused into your into your system sorry that way and they also they also have a couple of skincare facial skin care treatments and one of these in particular so this one's called fortify and this one's called soothe and I am like completely infatuated with this product so you know usually when I'm testing a product like if I'm testing something in my nightly regimen what I want to do is use it sometimes every other night or so right so that I can see if there's a difference in the morning and how my skin reacts so I had been doing that since I got a bottle of this and I have come to realize that I love using it like I love the whole experience of this product it's it's I don't even know how to explain it like it smells amazing it's a blend so the soothe the soothe oral CBD oil is a blend of seven ingredients of five of which or is it four of which are non fragrant plant oils it just smells incredible non fragrant plant oils that we all know and love right now I have on my fingers and I'm not going to be able to scroll so it's got baroja seed oil it's got sunflower oil it's got hemp seed oil aka cannabis sativa seed oil and it's got chamomile and you know we know that chamomile is super soothing so those oils make it not unlike the the topical skincare oils that facial oils that I have reviewed recently though the one from Kiehl's I think it's called cannabis sativa seed concentrate the one from the one from Peter Thomas raw is baby here right so these are these are these are oils that are that that have cannabis sativa seed in the in the blend and so cannabis sativa seed helps to soothe skin but the difference between these the Kiehl's version the first aid beauty version is that this also contains something called crystalline cannabidiol so that's the that's the the CBD that's giving it it's kind of kind of it's kind of pushing it taking it up a notch from just straightforward facial oils and so what I have found on the day after the day after I use this is my skin is noticeably more calm I you know very often I have like parts of my face that experience irritation right up here and my forehead very commonly shows irritation so the the days that I the mornings after I use this product hands down it's quite obvious to me because I'm so in tune with how my skin looks and how my skin acts I have noticed that this product actually does soothe komm irritation and that's what it's intended to do so Hempfield claims that it calms a sensitive skin that it's an anti-inflammatory and that it's ideal for acne prone skin which is something that heals claims on their cannabis sativa seed concentrate so that but the thing about this so I only like in immersing myself in literature and research matter-of-fact Heather had given me a couple of pamphlets on CBD and on the products to take with me and I was like enthralled with them like who gets into educational pamphlets the people who write them so I I have been researching like what is it about these products that makes them kind of magical right or gives them a distinctiveness like when we talk about when we talk about these the oral tinctures you know this one's called headies and this one is called tunnel vision so this one is intended to help you focus obviously and heddes is to help alleviate headaches there's one called Forty Winks which helps you sleep so but what makes each of them different if they're using CBD and so what makes them different is something called terpenes and terpenoids of the in in this case of the cannabis plant there are apparently more than 100 isolates or terpenes in the cannabis plant and each of those has a distinct effect a specific benefit in the body so the terpenes in the tunnel vision have apparently the effect of helping you to focus and concentrate your mind and so I've been actually using this and I don't know do I notice well I noticed that I'm not like not concentrating but so but the the ones that I mean that's kind of like a big like a big benefit right are you more concentrate or less able to concentrate like if you can't concentrate something's going on anyway like you maybe have a lack of sleep so the but the Forty Winks is very obvious does it help you sleep better yes in fact it does and the I have a CBD supplement in pill form that I've been using kind of experimentally like let's see if this actually does work and you know you pop one of those at 15 milligrams 15 20 milligrams and depending on the concentration in your oil you you have to kind of figure out what's what's the right dosage so 15 15 to 20 milligrams dosage and obviously in a supplement form that's already taken care of and I'm like out like I'm in a coma I wake up in the morning and like Orpheus is blinking like what just happened um so if you have a concern for sleeping you know you have insomnia or you know anxiety keeps you up you really need to consider a form of CBD to help you to help you sleep it really does work in terms of anxiety if I'm having a particularly stressful day I have actually you know taken a little bit of the not the head ease but one of the one of the CBD concentrates that is just straight on terpene list I guess and it does really calm me down it's really incredible so I'm like excited to explore all of this stuff and I encourage you to do the same I have some links in the new blog companion to this video that can help help you with that research but my own personal research shows me that it's not BS in the least bit and if companies like Hempfield botanicals keep doing what they're doing and making like legit claims you know that are substantiated there are two form on on the Hempfield botanicals team so if the brand knows what it's doing and it knows how to how to communicate how to message what CBD does and what the individual within terpenes and the formulas are able to achieve then you know it look the products are all natural so like it's natural medicine and you know this this whole wave of you know THC and marijuana like medical marijuana that's legit like if you know anybody who experiences severe pain the medical marijuana takes care of that right it really does alleviate that and it's certainly more beneficial or less harmful than chemical substances like you know opioids so you know I should have started this out but it doesn't matter when I communicate this this is also in the blog so you know that we need to train our minds and how you do that is through education by reading and and you know being curious to understand that there's a difference between THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis and CBD which is non so like SoCo psychoactive so when I say psychoactive I'm talking about how marijuana or THC gets you high and so that particular component of the cannabis or hemp plant interacts with with receptors in your in your body in your brain I think it's called the cb1 receptor and that's what gets you high the THC interacts with the cb1 receptor somehow stimulates the cb1 receptor and that's not what CBD does cannabidiol is the other component of the cannabis plant right so you have THC and CBD and CBD doesn't react that way it doesn't interact with the body's um I think it's the endocannabinoid and endocannabinoid system so the body has this this system that's actually set up to interact believe it or not with cannabis of all crazy things like it sounds nuts but if you like dig deep and you like research it you like discover that it's like it's legit and that's why CBD and why components of the cannabis plant that include THC are able to alleviate anxiety and pain and able to help you sleep so it's this body's system and the receptors in the system that are interacting with the components of CBD to achieve those benefits in the body and it's all natural so that brings me to the one last product I want to talk about that Hempfield botanicals offers so we have the oral oils we have the the facial the facial oils that are topical skin care amazing product and then we have topical skincare that has medicinal benefits to it so like two weeks ago I would say and you might have noticed it like in like I noticed it in some of my videos I was like there's that that crazy redness on my wrist I started to realize that I was getting like a getting eczema like just really itchy dry skin irritated patchy like exactly what you think on my elbows and on my wrist and so I like I'm like what is going on like what is this I'd never had eczema before and it's like huh and I looked it up and I liked it like Google Images and sure it was like okay that's exactly what I have it looks exactly like that it feels it's a little bit edgy it's the same thing it's not like I don't have a like some crazy ass disease although I guess eczema is a disease right and so I went online and I ordered um I don't remember what the name of the product was but I ordered an XML lotion from Amazon and I knew even though was two-day shipping that I wasn't gonna get it for three days because it had the packages in my building it processed and everything takes a while unless you have an emergency and it wasn't an emergency so in the meantime like this particular area of redness and itchiness is like interacting with my watch band which was a nightmare because all day long I would feel it like oh god there it is and it was just a little a little crazy and disconcerting and I thought God what do I even have like in the interim to treat this while the lotion is coming and I remembered that that Hempfield had had given me this incredible salve like this mysterious salve which is loaded up with CBD and essential oils and let's see if I have it here somewhere so there's spearmint in here which means that it smells actually quite magnificent and so it's a it's a it's for pain it's for pain and inflammation right and so I thought to myself well at least it'll probably make the itching go away but truthfully I started applying this and the eczema like by the time that cream came three days later the eczema was barely noticeable and it was just a little bit of a red patch so even though that's kind of not what this product is formulated to do this is what I talked about this is what I mean when I talk about how like cmed has like all these incredible benefits that we are only barely just now understanding so this I'm like I'm not almost like get some sort of ache so every once in a while when I'm lifting weights I get a sprain in my arm and so I haven't been able to test this yet as a pain reliever but as an XML reliever and an itch reliever yeah this is this is it this ain't bad so anyway that's it guys just just do some exploring know that this is this is a it's a nascent market it's you know it's it's kind of cool it feels a little bit like the Wild West but you know when you really look at it and you look at you know legit brands like Hempfield botanicals there's their substance here it's it's real and it's kind of exciting and I'm this is like to me I'm gonna look back on this year 2019 was the year that CBD came into my life so anyway that's all have a good one be sure to check out my youtube page and subscribe please to my youtube channel and check out the blog at skin karma com where all of this diatribe is put into words and that's it have a good one you guys later", "9hcJiK4-T5w": "hey guys hello welcome back to life above the clouds my name is Lauren gah and I have my friend came back here with me I love you might remember her from our pumpkin dinner roll video yeah yes and today I'm really excited because we were gonna make cannabis cell so we have one cup of cannabis coconut oil and we have one cup of cocoa butter you could also use shea butter if you wanted to we're a no butter or mango butter and here k has shaved off of this block of beeswax with one cup of beeswax and we're gonna use two tablespoons of jojoba oil and we have these were my three essential oils but then k fried this entire box of essential oils that's a partial partial sometimes like the room to smell good I have a double boiler set up here it's just a saucepan with about an inch of water and it's simmering and then I have a glass bowl place on top and we're gonna melt all of our ingredients together how easy is that why don't you go ahead and pour in that beeswax and then we're adding cocoa butter and then our cannabis coconut oil I've already melted it because it's easier to measure out when it's melted and yes our two tablespoons of jojoba can I just have a silicon spatula I am going to use to mix this all together while it melts easy peasy lemon squeezy so when we're done with this you can put this you can make it into a lotion bar but by putting it in like a cupcake liner I've also saved this little lotion container that you forgot a jar yeah you can put it in a little jar or I actually even saved a chapstick container pour it in the chest and let it cool could wear this also as trap stick so I also brought a measuring cup with a spout so we can use it to pour into my chopstick containers you can also buy these a craft store you could also I clean out an old deodorant container and use that oh yeah you can pour it into the container and let it harden we're almost completely melted so I'm just going to twist it all the way back down and then you can just pour it in

important challenges that you might be facing I know lots of us are battling with the anxiety depression pain is actually a challenge for most of us and today we've got a special product for you from Moringa Foods International and it goes by the name of CBD oil you might have heard about it but today I'm not alone in the studio about the CEO of Moringa Foods international to make sure that they can give you the lowdown and make sure you understand fully what CBD oil is about Jay welcome today thank you for having me in the studio and thank you for joining us and I know lots of people have heard about CBD oil but what many are sure of how to use it what exactly is it and this is why today we've got you to explain and give our viewers more information when it comes to CBD oil thank you so be a pleasure to share that information with you yes let's start with the one that we've got I like you if you write premium this is the premium CBD oil and this is from hemp that's right and I wanted to start by saying here we've got the six hundred milligram that we've got for you today and I like the fig that we always about good prices here TV more you're not going to pay 750 rounds and because we care about you and we want you to save and so that your money can go a long way you're going to pay six hundred and fifty rounds that's a saving of a hundred rounds so that's the premium hemp CBD or 600 milligrams tell us more about EJ you mentioned the fact that we use the word premium on our label the reason for that is because it denotes quality very high quality and high efficacy okay we expect the results to be positive on every single application or use we we see of what the benefits there which we're looking at pain relief we're talking about increasing appetite I hope we're not talking about overeating they're reducing stress promoting healthy cell growth and of course I like the part of the nausea and fatigue and also the brain health can you let's touch mostly on the pain aspect because I know most people are using lots of money on painkillers they are using lots of money on energy supplements they're using men of many on sleeping aids but and I know as we were talking Elia on you spoke about CBD or being able to assist in most of those conditions most definitely and without the side effects of a lot of what people are using currently so son if you look at the used to cost factor yes you'll find that it's cost-effective for the results that you're getting but I must point out something very important about as efficient as CBD is yeah it's a non psychoactive is very important because most people will always confuse and say ok the hemp one and the one that comes from marriage one what's the difference well it's actually taking on a high we're actually saying viewers when you talk about the premium hemp extract from you know from from the marina food I international there is no high that's associated with this is not psychoactive so this is actually a very good one if you look at the comparison there look at that we could it contains 0.3 percent or less of the THC the THC is actually the component that actually you know causes the high you think we always throw this the temps can you actually tell us what so what you'll find is that th is the psychoactive ingredient in both hemp and cannabis Jen drop the gentle plant species but what you find is Barlow be required to remove it from all our products okay so the maximum usage per day is twenty milligrams legally so be ensure that is absolutely no THC definitely below the legal limit I can see as you can see there we've got the comparison quite nicely there to make sure that you know we can understand that there is a difference and we look at that THC and actually how the plant look like but when we look at it we're saying this the one from hemp does not actually cause problems in the sense that it is not psycho active not have lots of THC so I think just to tell our viewers more about that the main difference because the too many greens being CBD and THC you find that in in marriage one I have got more of the THC and less of CBD and it's actually the reverse when it comes to the hemp one we've got more of the CBD and less in fact almost if I can variant very negligible and in fact what we do is we have a certificate of analysis that actually shows the breakdown of every ingredient in our products and you'll find that the MP is about ninety-nine point eight percent yes and then you get CBDs CBN's and CB G's that'll make out the difference I like the fact that okay you guys we have got the three hundred milligrams are on offer today our call center agents are waiting for your call zero eight six one a triple zero one seven three we are saving you a hundred runs normally you would pay 750 runs but today we are giving it to you for six hundred and fifty rounds of course they also do make a three hundred milligram which you can also purchase so but today what's on offer is the six hundred milligram and when you took dosages it's important because people want to know this is a 30 mil bottom in terms of how one would take for example if I'm taking it for pain how much would I take well each bottle contains about 600 drops okay and you only required on the 300 yarn you required to take about six drops three times a day if required okay because you determined that by your pain factor so we normally measure pain from zero to what to tare to ten so if you in about the three to four factor region yes then you'll use this like normal users following the the dosage instructions and they'll probably last for about two two to three months okay if it's for insomnia then you don't have to take it all day long just take it before bed time until outreach with your city so we've got lots of people I know what battling to go to sleep because we using lots of stimulants during the day and that affects how we'll then you know I produce those hormones that are supposed to help us to sleep we're telling you today that we've got a premium product premium hemp CBD oil which is going to help you so if it's way insomnia one we'll just take it before they go to bed actually so you just how many drops would you take so on the 300 you probably take about six drops okay you can actually determine yourself and we need to take you know how much is enough for yourself and is a dosage charge that's that comes together bottle people normally worry about overdosing jealous would you really say it would be a concern when it comes to your products the premium see video that we've got in terms of overdosing No so science in depending scientific studies show that with the removal of the THC there's absolutely no psychoactive activity which means you can't overdose quite quite honestly you could finish most of that bottle in one guy just like you sleep so we are giving you a product that is actually very safe for you to take the only side effect would be you'll be wasting your money if you took all of it so take it as directed so that it can last for about a month or two so that you can get all those benefits that we have shown you there we're looking at pain relief I've told you lots of money is going into pain killers lots of money is going into you know taking care of anxiety and stress lots of money is actually being put into sleeping tablets and if you look at it how better you know to just get one product that will give you all those benefits a 650 runs only 650 runs we're saving you a hundred grands because normally you would pay six hundred and seven hundred and fifty runs for the six hundred milligram strength J in terms of far when you're taking the product are there any people that are exempted are any people that should not take this product that CBD today studies have shown that you could actually use it anytime and anybody can use it so in age groups you check in kids can also take it again but control number of drops okay and in association with the discussion you have with your medical practitioner most definitely so we're actually telling you that at least the good thing is now your medical professional they actually know more about CBD oil that's why it is actually available since it's a product that is actually legal that you can purchase from your outlets there your retail outlets but we are saying to you today let's save you money instead of going out there to pay 750 runs pay 600 runs 650 runs for this 600 milligrams strength but we also told you that the 300 milligram strength is also available for so this is CBD oil to take care of your anxiety your stress manage your stress well make sure that you can sleep better I like the power of sleep because J I can tell you if we look at the statistics lots of people are not sleeping well and for me I value sleep a lot because if you look at it we're supposed to be sleeping eight hours a day that translates to about a third of our life so for someone was six years old you should have been sleeping for what 20 years so that's the value of sleep because that's when now you recharge the batteries that's when you actually get to be able to wake up energized most of us are battling they start their day on a cup of coffee why because they are lacking energy how about now using a product that's going to help you to make sure that now you don't have to depend on those stimulants you don't have to depend on those sugary drinks to get your energy we're talking about the premium hemp CBD oil and

common questions about making it part of your daily routine [Applause] [Music] let's start with the easy stuff how to use CBD to use one of our CBD oils you'll want to apply one full dropper to the desired area if you're using our CBD muscle rub you can apply it generously to your joints or muscle and massage it in well if you're using our calm CBD roll-on you apply it to your neck and chest as desired pretty simple right of course it's not just important to know how to use CBD knowing how to make it part of your daily routine is just as crucial you see a lot of people use CBD once or twice and when they don't experience instant results decide that it just doesn't work for them but before you decide CBD doesn't work for you be sure to give it a chance we recommend using it daily for 30 days that will give you the opportunity to really see how CBD can work for you the idea is to make it a consistent habit if you're using calm CBD roll-on make it part of your bedtime routine if you exercise regularly make CBD muscle rub part of your post-workout routine it's combination of pure essential oils and CBD offers a cooling sensation and can help soothe sore muscles use CBD oils it may help to use it around the same time every day to establish a routine you can always use that at different times as desired but it's a good idea to try to use it regularly so it becomes a habit as you create a routine around CBD it's important to remember that everyone is different we all have our own unique circumstances and things affect us in different ways your experience with CBD may not be identical to other people who have used it don't get caught up thinking that your own experience is a failure just because it's different than somebody else's try writing down why you chose to start using CBD then jot down a few notes about how you feel every day so you can track your well-being over time and at the end of 30 days you'll be able to look back and reflect you may also experience more result by using a higher strength product nature's ultra each of the products is available in two concentrations of CBD some people achieve the results start looking for at a lower strength and others will achieve them at a higher strength we recommend starting at a lower concentration and working your way up to a higher concentration if desired over time you'll find the perfect routine and strength for you thank you for joining us on this episode of CBD 101 be sure to LIKE and subscribe so you don't miss an episode see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Zcw1-qLqhHA": "I love it that is love me is [ __ ] counterfeit I get down one right onto another [ __ ] yeah college educated she graduated any field she can't find her parents paid in the shell was born what is up everybody and welcome back we're here today with the third and final nineties nectar review we are going to be doing the CBD sub and the CBD soft gels today so I have been using both I finally got a chance a few times to use the CBD stove also I know I've been pronouncing it wrong now I was saying cell door solved before and it's I believe sev so yeah that's what I'm gonna go with now I will start off with the CBD soft gels these again are 330 pills three hundred milligrams of CBD and they're ten milligrams each you can take one or two so the serving size is one soft gel but then at the bottom it says recommended use take one two soft gels daily as needed they're not vegetarian there's like I said 30 in a bottle there one calorie each calories from fat one cannabidiol ten milligrams the ingredients I'm gonna skip a couple of them because I don't know what they are but there's MCT oil Fido cannabinoid rich hemp oil beta-carotene and gelatin capsule zero THC as are all their products the CBD here is no THC whatsoever this USA grown and I'll read you guys the little paragraph that they have on the back here so it says our final cannabinoid rich hemp oil soft gels are created with our proprietary water-soluble liquid this product is is designed to have maximum absorption and optimum bioavailability contains other minor vital cannabinoids such as CBG CBN CDC and over 40 naturally present terpenes so that's pretty cool and also says door away from heat humidity and light do not refrigerate [Music] CBD is a natural constituent of hemp oil so I'm gonna show you guys the pills I think I have taken a couple out before comes with this little uh one of those little dry pack things in there keep away any moisture so they're nice little kind of clearish slightly golden pills i have taken two at a time all the times that I've tried them I actually had one of my friends try a couple two and he's got you know he's got diabetes so he's got diabetic neuropathy and a couple other ailments as well and he actually said that it really helped with his pain and he kind of felt more relaxed too so I'm kind of trying to get everybody into CBD here um I got my dad taking it I have a mom try it no I'm getting friends into it I mean it can help anybody so I think it's awesome actually I think I'm gonna take a couple of these right now so I just took two out of the bottle and I'm just gonna take so I won't get any real effects a noticeable effects from them just because there's no they're non psychoactive so you're not gonna get that high that you get with THC you're gonna get more of the pain relief or stress relief anti-inflammatory stuff like that that you're gonna feel more in your body as opposed to like the head high or body high next is CBD sev this is a thousand milligrams it's two ounces a thousand milligrams CBD sorry and scent is lavender and eucalyptus so the ingredients on this are non-gmo cold pressed virgin coconut oil organic beeswax vital cannabinoid rich hemp oil lavender oil and eucalyptus oil the suggested use is applied liberally to the affected area if the conditioned process seek assistance from a qualified health care practitioner warning for external use only avoid contact with eyes mucous membranes damaged skin or wounds tamper-evident bottle use only at the seals intact like I said I believe most of their products did come with like that clear plastic seal around the lid so you know that they were sealed it's fully decarboxylated its solvent free pesticide free and GMP compliant and it says our topical delivery system is designed to improve absorption bioavailability and optimization of help health benefits some of the possible benefits of applying hemp oil typically are listed below joint and muscle pain cramping headaches psoriasis eczema and acne so it's really good for a lot of things I actually have kind of like a dry patch on the side of my foot I believe I have plantar fasciitis so I've been wrapping it up a tape my dad has it as well so he kind of showed me how to wrap it up and everything so being wrapped up all the time it's gotten kind of dry so I actually did use some of this and it's pretty I think I put it on there maybe two or three times so far and I feel like it's already probably about 90% better so I'm gonna say I love this stuff already and I do love these I've taken probably five times and I took two each time and every time I felt that kind of like just body relaxation and just kind of felt relaxed mellow more stress-free not completely obviously about more than usual and just kind of some pain relief I would have to stay out of all the products surprisingly the one that I probably thought I would like the least I actually like the best and that would be the tincture I love the peppermint tincture and it works wonders any time I use it I feel completely relaxed and like pretty much all pain is gone so I love nineties nectar I definitely will be ordering from them again probably be getting some soft gels for a couple other people but I love everything so please go check them out I tried recording this video a couple days ago but I didn't check my camera before and I didn't delete any previous videos so it happened to cut out after three minutes which kind of sucked because there's probably a 10-15 minute video so I kind of lost everything and I've been working the last couple days probably 25 hours in the last two days so just now getting a chance to make this so I hope you guys enjoyed and I will be doing another review in the next couple days I forgot to smoke you guys in the last video so I just heated up my banger and turned my timer on we got about 15-20 seconds or so left got me a nice little chunk on here we're gonna go in on this nice little dab of I believe it's our og from Bandito extracts still a little bit hot so we're gonna give it another second or two all right we're good cheers everybody peace", "jymg-5bwAI4": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today we're going to talk about the indica raw hemp 3% the indica raw hemp 3% has 300 milligrams of full-spectrum supercritical co2 extracted him inside each bottle the bottle is 10 milliliters and has about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper full which is about one milligram of CBD per drop if you are one to stay up to date on all of the latest in the hemp industry make sure you like and subscribe to our Channel the indica story is actually really cool this is the very first brand to sell hemp products online they actually controlled the entire product from the little bitty seed until you get the bottle they have a little over two thousand acres at the time of this recording all in Northern Europe Denmark area when you order your product because it is both in Europe and in the US and headquarters in California it takes about three days like I got mine just in under three days from the time that I placed my order online until the time that I got it in my house so they're really really on target with their shipping times too another really great thing about the indica raw hemp number three or three percent is that it includes both CBD and CBD a so the difference between the two are mainly the biggest difference is the CBD a is the non-heated the non decarboxylated oh say that one really fast and so you're getting slightly different benefits because you get to have both CBD a and CBD both of them are great for inflammation anxiety and things of that nature but the fact is you're you're getting both of them in this particular product so that helps to aid in the entourage effect so each bottle is 10 milliliters it only has one flavor and that is natural it is very natural and like I said one drop is about one milligram and a full dropper is about thirty milligrams it comes with a non marked glass dropper and you'll notice that it's very dark it's a very very dark full-spectrum product for me I normally don't take thirty full milligrams of CBD although I did do it at night and it was amazing to help me sleep so during the day I generally take about a quarter of a dropper because I am not good enough to count those drops underneath my tongue so let's try it indica uses a hemp seed oil as its carrying base and it is non-gmo it is organic and it is created or manufactured in a GMP certified facility that means every single time you take this product every single time you buy this product you know exactly what you're going to get it is a very high quality product with consistent results from their test which by the way they do a really good job of showing you and giving you access to their tests so on the side of the box you'll see a little bitty UPC code and on the back is actually digits that are stamped on there with it looks like a date and a four digit code that was a little confusing to me at first honestly when I went in to type in the batch number but basically it's the last four digits that you need for the batch it's also on the side of the bottle so if we stand it up and then turn it you're gonna see that same those same dates and four digits in order to find the test results you have to go to their website and there is a tab on the far right where it's quality control and then what you do is you search for they give it to you in like 50 batch numbers so you have to go into your drop down to about your 50 range and then find it let's dive a little deeper into the test results so something that indica does really really really well is they tell you everything probably even more than most people want to know you're gonna get the microbial reports you're gonna see how they tested for pesticides which by the way both of those tested non-deductible non-detectable and then they show you the different terpenes as well as cannabinoids inside their product so something that I definitely wanted to make sure that you are aware of that indica did is this is called indica raw hemp 3 for 3 percent if you look at the test results you will actually find that it's actually a little bit more than 3 percent of the total concentration it's like 3.3 percent and I know that that's not a ton of a difference however in an age where everyone's trying to round up and sell you more I really appreciated the fact that these guys were like hey it's just 3% even though they're giving you more than that and so that just kind of spoke volumes to me about the corporate culture and what they're trying to offer their consumers so you're gonna notice that it's got a very nice packaging it's a pretty heavy Winkle blue if you've seen some movies not quoting any on the outside it's very clear and easy to read and you're gonna see that it's 3% this is actually labeled a little bit differently than products in the US which are usually labeled as per dropper full of milligrams of CBD or the total amount of CBD in the bottle this is labeled as a percentage of the entire bottle which is it was a little confusing to me as an American consumer but once I started digging into it it actually made a whole bunch of sense it does have one milligram of CBD per dropper so you know if you're taking a half a dropper that's about 15 drops or about 15 milligrams of CBD so when you get it you're gonna notice that on both of them it does have the batch number but it also talks about all of the different products that are inside of it and so you can see that they actually have omegas in it and they it is using a hip seed oil as the carrier base okay so now let's actually talk about taking this product the first thing that you're going to notice when you open it up is it has a very pungent smell like you don't even have to get it that close to smell you can smell it from here it's very strong very earthy flavored and I actually smell kind of a bunch of pine needles almost and that's actually due to the terpenes terpenes inside the canvas planter what gives it its flavor and this one tests really high for limonene which is the same turkey and that's found in lemons but believe it or not it's also found in pine needles which is something I learned while doing this review and so it made a whole bunch of sense to me that I finally like that's why I smell pine needles it is very very strong and the flavor does stay with you so definitely keep that in mind when you are considering purchasing this product however I want you to tell I wanted to tell you that the first time I used it I used 15 drops which is about a half a dropper full about 15 milligrams of CBD I took it and within 30 minutes I fell asleep and guess what ladies and gentlemen I stayed asleep the whole night which is basically a miracle so this is very very very effective I didn't need to take it the next day because I didn't really hurt and so I found myself just supplementing with this as I needed throughout the day which sometimes it was never sometimes it was in the middle of the day like when I was ready to pull my hair out and then I would again I wouldn't have to even take a full dropper full a half a dropper or even a quarter of a dropper was enough to take the anxiety away and help me to get focused and get a whole bunch of stuff done actually this just happened I was working on something and I got really really stressed out so I took a quarter of a dropper which is about seven or eight drops and I lost complete track of time and I was almost late to my daughter's piano lessons because I was so focused so this stuff is very effective albeit it is also very very very strongly flavored so now let's get down to the Nitty Gritty when you go to purchase the indica raw hemp 3 you'll notice that the value of it's actually pretty good it's a very I can they consider this a moderate strength with about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper I consider this more a little bit on the higher strength dose a higher concentration it does come in a 10 milliliter size bottle which is a little slower but it is very effective so cost per milligram it's very very very reasonably priced and you'll really appreciate that you'll also notice that it's it works like a little bit goes a long way it's very very very effective at what it does to help reduce anxiety reduce residual pain and to help you sleep and so you don't need as much which helps to maybe cushion the purchase price just a bit the one thing that you definitely definitely want to keep in mind is that this stuff is strong flavored like it's strong and so if flavor profiles definitely get to you if that's something that you can't get over even with a little bit of water you might still taste it keep that in mind with this indica rub but oh my gosh it's not like you're sitting here taking this as your dessert you're taking this because you're seeking relief from anxiety or you're taking this to help you sleep or maybe some relief from inflammation so if you take it with that in mind like I'm not taking this because it tastes good I'm taking it because it freakin works then just take it and then go chase it with your cake okay and then you'll definitely love the indica or all three before we go remember that this indica raw hemp 3% has one milligram of CBD per dropper or about thirty milligrams of CBD per dropper full it does have about 2.2 percent THC which is the legal limit in Europe and you can get it both in Europe and in the u.s. it is strongly flavored so keep that in mind but it is such an effective product and the price point is so easy for you to get into in my opinion it's really worth your it's worth your time and your investment to try this product out let me know if you've tried it I for one love it I definitely will be keeping this around my house it is very effective it works it does taste strong but I actually I really appreciate how little I have to take to get all of the benefits from the CBD and I also appreciate the fact that it isn't that expensive to to procure if you will I'd love to know what your thoughts are if you've tried it and if you want to learn even more about all of the different hip

source for all things CBD where I will be giving you reviews every week on a new product we've got about 30 products slated right now to start giving you reviews on and the first one I want to talk about is indica this is their wrong and boil it was the first oil that I tried and it's what started me down the rabbit hole of starting household him actually I loved it so much I had my first drop of CBD oil and my best sleep that it had in two and a half years and so I reached out to the company with my idea for household ham we made some great friends and they sent me some more products to try and first here's the robbing of oil and this is about just so that how much I personally take and I started off with even smaller amount than that and eventually increased and lock down my sweet spot and that's about how much I need four really great nicely it's my anxiety which we know all the moms need help with and then my second favorite thing which was probably tied as a first favorite if you have the money just getting both of them and you'll thank me is their South here and all of their ingredients are natural you can recognize them all it's the CBD coconut oil beeswax lemon oil citral vanilla and buy money nothing with red flags there you can see hopefully here you can see where I've just been dipping my finger into the same spot and I treat this thing like medicine for myself it is 750 milligrams and it is just an oily nough swen you rub it it's just an opening this on your finger my neck always has tension I don't wanna waste it and since it doesn't spread very far I mean the willingness just is like right where your finger rubs I just put it on the most acute spot and then what I like to do is pair it up there whipped body butter so this one has more it's very very faint lemon / vanilla ingredients and this one is a little bit more like cocoa and it spreads much easier as you can see I just got a whole dollop on mine and it's a little bit more firm if you keep it in the frigerator but it is literally 82 degrees in my house right now cuz i live in florida and i like to keep the windows open so anyway this I liked on top of whatever location I've put the South cuz it just spreads so much easier and so in about 20 minutes the tension in my neck is going to be gone I put this on joint pains muscle pains and it's been clinically proven CBD to be really great for skin and that's what they market face-forward is actually a foreskin and I have used it for my child's eczema my toddler had horrible eczema from four months old until two and a half years old but yeah so I put this out on the worst spots of her eczema and then rubbed body butter on top within 24 hours it was gone after spending probably hundreds of dollars on steroid creams and every kind of eczema cream you could imagine my friends made essential oil creams nothing really worked some things would like reduce the flare but not like what this DVD did it's completely gone so I have before and after pictures of that on my blog and household and the ingredients here very similar let's see shea butter palm oil cocoa seed butter the CBD coconut oil tapioca vanilla beeswax and find me again all very natural and trusted ingredients and then you've got the lip balm which is very similar ingredients to this almost identical and so it's really just that's in this convenient format you can drop it in your makeup bag oh here's a little fara she was tired of being alone in her Walker so yeah so talking about the lip balm here and with CBD being so amazing for your skin you can imagine you're just like it was just amazing how supple and soft your lips are after that the next thing is the chewing gum here let me open that up for you so let's see what that looks like paper and it's made with real gum like from the tree in the rainforest Chiclets gum from the rainforest xylitol from birch trees wild peppermint mint sunflower seeds and hemp oil so again all natural ingredients and everything is organic they they grow their own hemp on organic certified land their whole facility is organic certified I hope I'm saying that correctly and their third party lab tested and they have their certificates on their website call all the labs and actually talk to them about it and so I just this is one of the brands that I just trust the most and that's for the gum it is like what our grandparents probably chewed it's not like the kind of gum that you would pick up in fancy wild colors at the gas station or at the checkout line it is real gum so after about 20 to 30 minutes of chewing it it kind of starts to break down and just and spit that out if you try to take it out with your fingers it's gonna stick to your fingers again and that's not a bad thing I'm just setting up your expectations and because it is real gum and the reason for putting CBD and a gum is because of that bioavailability so you know I talked about putting this beneath your tongue because it's so thin on the sides of your cheeks and underneath your tongue the CBD can just soak right in and so this is just the gum while you're chewing I'm not gonna chew on one video that's gross but oh you're chewing that CBD is just in all of the right places and so it's just going to soak into you immediately and that would be a great way to get the effects that you're looking for the

thrive em store gotta bring you a quick review on Blue Ridge hemp companies CBD infused SAP it is awesome so Justin's holding the naan opened package so that you can see what it looks like when it's not been almost all the way roped off because this is our very loved CBD SAP this is actually the very first product that we started carrying inside thrive hip store a vegan wellness because I was a little bit new to CBD and CBD supplementation and I didn't want to start out ingesting anything so if you're anything like me this might be a super great place to start because you do have the endocannabinoid system all over your body it runs just through your skin and guess what is your largest organ ding ding ding it's your skin so this is this is a really great way to try a CBD product and it is great for things like aches and pains that's what we usually use it for but I know my brother-in-law he actually likes to use this when he's got he's got it's that eczema rheumatoid eczema psoriasis and he's got something like that and he likes to use this particular product for his psoriasis when this you know that's dry flaky skin he really sees improvement for that because CBD helps with inflammation and it helps to calm down your nervous system were you about to say something I was just saying my dad uses it because he's got some injuries to his knees in his back and he likes this one specifically because of its he feels like it works better his orbs a little faster there's 200 milligrams of CBD in this 2 ounce container and it last him he uses a little bit couple times a day and I last time about a month I think yeah yeah we've had this one as you can tell it's well loved let me show you please don't judge us because it is well loved is almost all the way gone and when you get it out keep in mind this is a natural product they don't have anything to keep the products from you know separating or anything like that so because it's got cocoa butter in it if it warm cuz we don't you know keep our house super freezing he hates that it sort it can kind of get a little bit melty but this is what it looks like on your finger and you can rub it wherever it hurts like I'm going to put it on my elbows and here lately he's been rubbing on my shoulder because I had I fell around Christmastime kids toys are horrible especially when the low light conditions and so this has been awesome it helps to reduce pain associated with that fall and you know the fact that we are closer to 40 than we are 30 so this one they use mango butter cocoa butter coconut oil as well as often when it gets one arnica is arnica infused olive oil which is awesome for aches and pains yeah it also just helps with aches and pains so has a has a nice scent I enjoy it it has menthol as well in it so it feels a little it gets a little warm after you rub it on your skin just so you'll be aware but I like it it works great and it'll last for quite a while the one thing that you do want to keep in mind with the Blue Ridge hip company CBD and few salve is that it comes in at about $50 and so depending on the different products on the market this is a little bit more expensive however it is a 100% natural product you're using oils you're not using any words that you can't pronounce like on the back it has all of the different products in it and it is all things that you and I can pronounce and they use a lot of essential oils which I love as well and that's what kind of gives it that scent like a rhenium and I'm drawing I'm drawing a blank and lavender and calming things like that so you do pay a little bit more but it's because it's an all-natural product and let's be honest sometimes going the natural route is a little bit more expensive unfortunately so and blue chip company is out of Asheville North Carolina I almost forgot yeah it's just right up the road from you know flowers away yep so it's semi local we'll call it simmer whistle and it's in it's a great it's a smaller company they they make everything over there and Asheville I've talked with their sales rep they're super easy to deal with we do sell some here at thrive yoga and wellness and you can find it on our website thrive hemp store and if not go / - I have not go over to the Blue Ridge hemp company website and grab some tell them that we sent you you will not be disappointed this is a really great product it'll last you a while and we really love how it's dedicated to using more natural products things that you can pronounce things that I feel safe using on my skin and it just it plain works like that's like I said the first time I used it I used it on my feet and I noticed that it worked because my feet didn't hurt anymore it was amazing and then we went from just carrying this to

to review the four or five CBD bomb welcome on a Green Valley nation Channel as I told you today I'm going to review this four or five CBD bomb this is a video review however if you would like to read the written part of the review you can visit our website and of course the link you can find in the description box for five CBD is a British company that is on a hemp market since 2018 and it was created by two professional rugby players who started to use CBD to relieve pain and also help with the muscle recovery for five CBD uses organic hemp grown in slovenia slovakia czech republic and also the netherlands they offer CBD sport supplements and as you can see I ordered quite a few products and if you would like to hear the review of CBD oil and also CBD capsules we have that on our channel silica so you can look for it and right now I would like to show you my reaction when I receive the package from a45 CBD I would like to share with you that experience and later I'm gonna come back to talk about the lab test results and also about my experiences with that product this is the package I received from 4:5 CBD and here we have CBD oil and silikov soles and of course DVD bow which I'm going to focus on on this review however if you would like to hear my opinion about those those products c-45 CBD capsules and CBD oil and you have to search for this video on our channel because I've got this review for you but for now we're gonna focus on CBD bound so as you can see it contains 300 milligrams of CBD and it's natural oil and wax plane blend and it's in a 45 million litre container here we have information about this product that it's 100% natural its herbicide and pesticide free it was third-party laboratory tested and it's vegetarian vegan friendly here we have an ingredient list what is it exactly that the bomb or damaged skin and we've got also information how to use it so you should apply it topically right now we're gonna after this and inside we can find just a plain and playing container with the bomb again we can find here similar information to the information which was found on a box for example ingredient list at the bottom we have a batch number and right now I'm gonna I'm gonna also open it and because it was protected with this little thing and we're gonna take a look how it looks inside so as you can see it's a very nicely blended bomb and I can tell you that it smells very very nice I think that it's it smells like blackberry so now you can see how it looks like and it's yeah the texture of it is also very very nice I think that this product can last you for a very long time because as you can see I need only a little bit of it and I can feel that all my hand is is in this in that product so it's very nice and it's very very hard I would say you can only you if I would push my finger right there I cannot really push it too hard so you can only take a little bit of this product from from the surface of the of the oil helps from the surface of the bound and right now I would like to invite you to hear my review of to hear my personal experiences with that product as I just showed you in that short video clip you can find a bunch number on the bottom of your product and so you can go online and check the certificate of analysis and this is what I did and from the lab test results I found out that my product contained 5.9 milligrams of CBD per each gram and from the customer service I was also able to obtain the information that the bomb weighs 47 grams so I could calculate that in this whole jar there is two hundred seventy seven point three milligrams of CBD which is slightly less than it is on a label but it is within within the tolerance at this point of the review you probably know how this product looks like but let me emphasize one thing that it really smells very nice and the mental smell isn't very strong you you can barely smell it however if you put it on your skin you can definitely feel a nice cooling sensation on your skin thanks to mental it does increase the blood flow in the area it can also act as a local pain reliever so it's a very good formula for everyone who is exercising and who needs a supplement with mental and also CBD to speed up that to speed up the recovery process of the muscles and also to to relieve pain luckily in my opinion this is a great product for athletes who would like to use it after a workout it is also very efficient because you only need a little bit of it to cover a larger areas of your skin however some people may actually dislike the cooling sensation of it thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed my review if you have any questions please leave a comment in the comment section down below of course I strongly

supplement that has been known to help so many people in so many different ways which we're going to explore right right now and today but first of all introduce the fabulous cherry Kapil cherry hey lovely to see you very good now you're the co shows the co-founder of pro-life CBD yes explain a little bit about your company okay so pro-life seaweedy for anybody who doesn't know we've been working with primal for a while now a long time now it has been a long time and we're we feel so privileged to to be here and have pro-life here because our aim pro life's story if you like and what a more goal is to be the best provider of CBD oils and in sounds that were going to talk about later as well in world so we started this company we'll talk about this later but we set up the company quite a long time ago due to some personal issues that rule which we'll go into but we source the best CBD available in the world as far as we are concerned and from start to finish yes and that's what we bring to you today and it's so lovely it's so lovely to have cherry here in the studio as well to answer questions I'm going to be asking lots of questions that you may have at home you may know lots about there and the C video or you may know a little bit but we're really going to be exploring your mania may know nothing about it at all but first of all I've talked about the offers we have today okay so let's just talk through the oils now just be very clear these are oils you ingest these are oils you take will explain the quantities to stress the everything about this so there are three on off the today as well as the South okay so we'll talk again I'm just done so these are all the first way is 10 millimeter ten millimeter sized okay which is 3 that's the 8% the scale 8% in strength another 10 millimeters as well which is 20% and then we've got the bigger volume here as in quantity 300 million 400 milliliters and that sits in between a 10 percent yes okay and of course we've got the self as well where you can read target parts of the body as well yeah okay lots of questions to be home and what I love talking to you cherry because you're so passionate about this this comes off you're a real ambassador for for the oils there's not actually one question you don't know the answer to yeah and it's always fueled with such passion and I've got you know take us on a few journeys as well personal stories and how yeah but let's start right at the beginning yeah what is CBD good question really isn't it it's something that so many of us heard of now and so many people do know about it but also there are people new new customers all the time and so CBD stands for cannabidiol you will hear it pronounced differently especially by the Americans pronunciations but what did it puts as simply as I possibly can put it it is a compound okay so you will hear me talk about and you'll hear other people refer to cannabinoids yeah and this is from the hemp plant so the hemp plant is made up of over a hundred different cannabinoids cannabinoid just means compound right so CBD itself is the most important compound from the hemp plant as simply as I can yeah that's it okay and that is what we're focusing on it'sit's the compound that has the most health benefits that's proving to help people the most through so much research that's going on right now our oils do have other compounds in as well which we can touch on later yeah sure but CBD itself is is what everybody is talking about what everybody wants and it really is proving to be magical really just extreme will come on to how how it's been known to help her along the way but just just really signpost the quality of this pro life it really is different than what I've seen out there again we'll come to this yeah I'm always interested when we have where we have guests on and meet people like yourself cherry is how quite often there's a personal story or a narrative did CBD find you or did you find it and if you don't mind explain how yeah absolutely and Toby made many of you will have seen Toby here because he's done more shows yes and actually he's a here's the reason why we are here today unfortunately Toby last year was diagnosed with cancer okay he's only 30 in fact it was just before 30th birthday and of course that's devastation as it would be for anybody yeah and I'd already heard of CBD because of my own conditions I have epilepsy and diabetes and was told to take it and as I'm sure most people feel I don't know enough about it I didn't look into it enough I trust medicine medicine saved my life I think it's amazing but with cancer Toby having cancer it did find us in a way CBD did find us because we wanted an alternative option of course we were going to do everything possible for Toby in the medic going down the medical route but what if what more can we do to help him and so I thought let's give CBD ago what's the what's the harm it's been known to help reduce tumors it's been known to help with nausea yeah so I saw stem CBD or we sourced it together at the time and actually cutting a long story short we were sold something that wasn't what it said it was on Anton okay and now of course that fills you with doubt and mistrust and I thought well we've just spent a lot of money on something that actually isn't helping him it was that I think it was labeled as 20% in it and we found out it was 2% so you went through the tests to find out yeah yeah because it just we weren't seeing the effect and anyway long story short we ended up going to a company in America yeah that's how long it took us some trialing CBDs in the UK we ended up in America with a fantastic company who they set up because a little girl over there she was having 300 seizures a week and they also needed an option an alternative option because no medication was helping I had epilepsy they set at the CBD company and it's she's now seizure free which blows my mind it's absolutely amazing and of course I thought that works that's amazing oil we need it yeah and as we've we then bought it for what it over for Toby and it wasn't really until a friends and family said why don't you do this is it there is obviously a huge gap in the UK market for for this amazing oil there's lots available you will see it being sold in many many stores yeah but the quality wasn't there not that we could find not that we wanted for a serious condition like cancer yeah and so that's how it was born because our friends and family said why you I mean this is going to help people why don't you why don't you yeah offer it to the world it's not going to DJ I feel this from you and Toby there's an incredible passion I feel and with your pioneer is in many way that the purpose of what you're doing here was a driven from a passion of getting a quality getting the quality product to the people who yeah absolutely it's honestly it's it's strange to sit here and almost talk about it like it's a business because it was a personal help to our family it was just a it was to help to try and improve my brother's health yes to then change into a business and help other people has been amazing it's been one of the most incredible journeys and the feedback we've been getting and we've been getting from here at Prime yeah and that's where the passion comes from because the the feeling every single day yeah that you are helping people improve their lives is one of the best things in the world yes just unbelievable and also we didn't know at the time where the Toby would be how poorly he'd be he would be yeah he travels a lot for work he goes on television we didn't have to do this hair we didn't all these things and we thought you know what this gives him a project it's helping his health let's help other people and we are hugely passionate about it comes across and it comes across in the products well in the oils as well and here at primer living we love learning you are love learning as well we again it's always feel if you if we if we learn empowers as we can make more informed decisions and with the pro life it seems a very same sort of ethos as well about in getting that that knowledge absolutely and we learn all the time as well we're always learning right now as I say the I've just first of all and I just talk about what it can help with or how it's helped people yeah exactly but but just before then is this legal absolutely legal yes you can there's been a lot of debate around see we do yours but it is 100% legal in almost every country now now there are a couple of countries around the world that are yet to change their their laws but is in terms of you buying at home and taking in the UK it is 100% legal there is nothing about our oils that are okay we're really going to explore the ingredients and what's in these fabulous bottles along the way as well now what can now we've had who you've had to help me out as well as what can if I'm actually it's a very loaded question the big question what pan CBD helped with so I printed this off in it because yes it's never ending list almost do you know what this isn't even this doesn't touch the sides right because the list is ridiculous so let me just read for you and Finnick yeah just some of the conditions and this is this policy go online and have a look for yourself because this is just a tenth I mean there isn't anything yet that someone's come to me with where it hasn't I haven't been able to find a way that CBD would help so Justin lists a few addiction they go there on the screen for you as well ADHD Alzheimer's anorexia anxiety anxiety huge arthritis also huge heart disease glue coma depression diabetes my experience with diabetes is amazing epilepsy liver disease kidney disease nausea OCD are super Isis Parkinson's PTSD skin condition sleep disorders stress and stress this huge as well it helps people in stroke recovery anyone with bipolar disorders migraines moods yes I could honestly we could do extraordinary yeah yeah I mean I mean what were your thoughts and feelings here with this one and what I don't know what here at Brown living we have and we want the whole our show which is great but I know sometimes when you got people for five minutes or ten days people dip in and dip out so really championing and signposting the quality of these particular oils that we see I've seen CVD elsewhere for example yeah quality of these prolong it's it's everything I must say it's this is this is where it always boils back to why we are here yeah the reason why we didn't end up with an oil from the UK the reason why I love a soft little question then why are we here talking about this what is in these bottles is in our bodies anyway so cannabinoids all these compounds that you get within these bottles have always been within our body we produce them naturally but that's a whole that's a whole different thing we'll talk about that in a second but no but why pro life exists yeah is it's because it was for our health so we are not messing around on quality we don't try and cook any corners we aren't trying to produce it faster we aren't trying to produce it cheaper because to drop any of our quality standards in the process of the plant to getting it into that bottle yeah it just wouldn't it just wouldn't fit what we're trying to do I think one's across I mean I've been since I was doing this show with you I have research research research and there's all kinds of other extraction procedure which will go into yeah and they're in in a little while with any kind of when we here on probably living with any kind of the vitamins a bit minerals or someone's always have those two questions how where why which and how so how does this work give it a go alright this is a big one this and this will if you haven't heard about this before will fascinate you in terms of in terms of how it works yeah you need to try it then I'm not for yeah absolutely okay so this still today I have talked about CBD for I don't know how many days and hours of my life and it still blows my mind that this is that this works in in the way that it does okay so you get pipette yeah so let me first of all tell you about the endocannabinoid system yes that's everything we have a system in our bodies that they only discovered 30 years ago and you've got basically if Elliot could show us the picture there it is so you've gotta talk us through talk us through that is there you see all those green dots they are receptors uh-huh and that is what your endocannabinoid system is so it's receptors all throughout the body and what they control everything Wow mood appetite stress and anything that send you a body out of balance yeah yeah the endocannabinoid system is there to bring you back to homeostasis which is a word you will hear a lot here at primal a word that you will hear a lot associated with CBD the whole point of this system and there was an article the other day that actually said it is the most important system you've never heard of so should I take - no and you can't explain what if Nick takes them and then I can explain what is happening immediately and this is what's so so unbelievable about CBD yeah so you juice you produce this anyway okay yep so can we have cannabinoids that we produce within our body that naturally happens an endocannabinoid system works very nicely yeah until we become deficient which I'll talk about in a second okay and then you now are about to top up your cannabinoids wonderful okay so good in the bottle you get your pipette yes okay now what I would recommend we'll talk about doses and strengths later on yeah what I would recommend for you now if you just have like a third zapper pet yeah directly under your tongue why under the tongue because it will absorb into your bloodstream okay so the reason we don't do capsules the reason that we focus on oil rather than capsules is because it goes directly in your bloodstream and you don't if you had it at the capsule you would lose the absorption of course okay so under the tongue and you'll have to keep it there for 90 seconds please 96 yeah right okay so okay so how many do tell me cops recommend the my I would say just just for now let's plane drops ace about a third of the pipette I would do just under or just down okay so under your tongue okay so nips now taking it under his tongue in a very glamorous way and if we go back to the endocannabinoid system I'll tell you what's happening so then you don't have to look at Nick just [Laughter] this right now in Nick's body imagine that's Nick on screen now all of these kind of receptors are there what the CBD is doing now is going to the receptors that need it the most so you might I don't know people take it for migraines or I or IBS exactly I've surf a lot from anxiety and yep the nervousness anxiety that's something I you know deal with in managing my own way but I mean everybody does have a way of managing it but this is we're seeing such a huge response in terms of anxiety yes what this will do now is it will bind to your receptors if you were anxious now it would deal with that problem never be anxious with you cherry ever knows what it does it's binds to these receptors and it puts you back in balance right gotcha so unfortunately because of our life today because of other stresses of life because of our diet because of the pollution because of the way that we live yeah our systems are more out of balance more and more unfortunately it's hitting on the head and that's what would you know we talked a lot about here at primer I mean if you meant a technology for example technology's meant to enhance that quality of life and make as more efficient how much does it in which makes me it just makes us more seemingly for me I can speak personally but more stressful but if you look at all the qualities of life absolutely right it's almost like we're again are we built for this amount of sorry I don't know you know that's the thing I think we're stressing our bodies more and more this is where is this is why I think this has become so important recently because as that happens so as you're stressed as you're anxious as you're our diet isn't maybe as good as it should be yeah our bodies basically go out balance and that's where this comes in yes because where your body can't produce enough cannabinoids it enough of its own cannabinoids yeah and where the receptors are starting to slow down and not work as well yeah in comes this yes so CBD does two things yes it encourages your body to produce its own cannabinoids again mm-hmm and what then all these cannabinoids are going to do is work with the receptors in your endocannabinoid system sorry for being so technical that's good it's good but I love this view it is you know love this we love learning it's empowering and it's exciting because you think I won't how do we not know about this until we salute yeah yeah but the bottom line is CBD helps to get your body back in balance right and when you're in balance you're not sick and when you're in balance you fit have more energy and when you're in balance it's just it just makes sense doesn't it when you're at optimum health you feel your best yeah and that is the simplest way I can put it is Brede is there to get you back into balance absolutely okay so just to recap I know we've got I hope you got me for that the whole show but some people depend about five minutes these are the CBD oils on offer today okay let's talk you through so I've got the you've got ten mill are over 8% 8% in strength with the toolbox we will come we're going to come to the Trent's a little I've got the 10 mil off if I put that there 20% and the bigger bottle as in with volume and this is 100 mil at 10% so in between the two and we've also got the solved to come yeah as well well goes to the 20% round just so the cameras can see you can see at home okay so so starting with the strength and who where do people begin who would be so we start with the 8% who would who'd you recommend that for okay so a lot of people come to us that have tried maybe two and a half percent or three percent or five percent from somewhere else right and I understand why people try that because it's more affordable okay because you're getting less CBD yeah yeah the reason why our eight percent is our entry level if you like is because that's where we believe you get benefits but also not everyone necessarily needs higher than that so it's a perfect place to start so we have lots of people coming to a set of tried CBD from elsewhere and that's where they start yeah because I personally think you have to you have to gauge what you need everyone's doing we're all different and we respond differently to so I could easily recommend okay go straight in with 20% but you might not need that it depends on what you're taking it for so my mum for example perfect example doesn't take it for a specific ailment she just takes yep said everyday to give a dose and keep her as a preventative perhaps as a preventative and there's a key thing all my friends and family now that take it yeah I say well why you might not take it for a specific ailment but don't wait to get ill too then say I need CBD or like Toby unfortunately but that's what happened with Tony a lot of people take it as a preventative now yeah because it's keeping you in balance yeah and if you go out of balance yeah then you're more likely to get sick it's what it's difficult to know whether what comes first yes body goes out of balance and you get a disease yeah yeah well you get a disease and it sends you out of balance either way yeah this helps to keep that homeostasis going I mean this I mean I can I know so many people buzzing about this right now the deal is are as in you're stripping you're watching this means the deals still here so the free phone number is on the screen there as well if you have any questions we've got more to bring you as well cherries brain to pick as we go on but you've got the the three different sizes of bottle and strengths as well and exceed the price is flashed up on the on the screen here now cherry just before we came to wear as well with the shelves talking to Terry about the the processes because I've really researched and other brands as I say and the extraction processes you don't downplay it but there's so much work so much passion and so much emphasis on your extraction process and I can I do you mind if I taught you about this because is it quite extraordinary so and and it again we talked about the safety of the quality and the efficiency but the extraction process of your and the pro-life CD can you talk us through yeah absolutely and this applies by the way to all three because the eight percent that we were just talking about is is the same in theory as the twenty percent the ten percent there is no range in quality they're all absolute top quality it's simply how much do you need to take so the eight percent is the entry level is is is something that most people most people would take for the first time and then you might go up to the ten percent or 20 percent but I just wanted to make it clear that every single one is the same quality same extraction yeah yeah it's just how much you want to each bottles but yes extraction it okay so I was reading there are some practice out there or for example using ethanol yeah this is now you can read about this online and there are many different opinions about this okay I guess pro-life approach we co2 extract so I'll try next time explain this sorry I put on this - there's so much - but no there is so much to it and it's very very scientific but the bottom line is everything we do is natural no pesticides no herbicides no alcohol anyway not yeah there is we do not cut a corner most companies now most use ethanol extraction and that basically means simply as I can put it you soak all of the hemp in ethanol mm-hmm yes it will get rid of your pesticides and herbicides you can't then fully extract the ethanol gotcha you don't want to take you don't want to be taking ethanol that's not the idea so we do co2 extraction and not just that it's this is I don't know whether it's too technical but we do supercritical co2 extraction this is this is what my I was being treated by when researching researching earlier before you before and we came to air is they you don't have to do this but the fact is you do because you're so passionate about this I feel like you have you have I feel like you have to do it to say that you were offering quality CBD because you take CBD for your health you can't then say on what on the one hand take it for your health but then oh but you're also taking F and although you've also got okay pesticides everything has to be all gotten and we are certified that's another thing is growing it organically grown organically and it's certified and we don't just certify it in the US where it's come from this is from Colorado by the way it's all from Colorado the best the best base that we know of in the world and our relationship with them is fantastic but they certified in Colorado it's certified in the UK and we certified in Spain which is the best lab in Europe because we want anybody who takes this whether they're buying from the UK Europe America to know that their local lab if you like also supports what we are doing it is the best that we can visit make we cannot do anything better to make it more natural more organic and higher-quality nothing all of these that you are seeing now on the screen are just showing to you yeah that we have full-spectrum oils we have zero THC zero psychoactive hallucinogenic right so that that can I just yeah come to that because so so obviously so can you get high off CBD no why no you mentioned THC can you explain a bit more about THC I don't want THC to be seen as something bad because actually it has phenomenal the reason what they found the Inuk endocannabinoid system 30 years ago is because they were testing the effect of THC on the body and just for our viewers explain what what THC is THC is tetra hydro kind of a doll yeah just it was the HD yeah it's another compound so it's Warner for the 100 and I think 112 maybe more all of these compounds are in the hemp plant THC is the only one that has a psychoactive effect the only one that is illegal okay and it's not found in here right yeah no it's not in here not in family Hitler no nothing it's not found in our CBD oil and actually anyone who's selling legally has to be at it's less than 0.03 percent you have to have less than 0.03 percent for it to be legal okay in the u.s. I think it's less than 0.05 okay we have there we don't have less than we have there and we make sure that it's all tested to prove that there is not less than naught point naught 3 it's just zero there's nothing found no trace when it should and it should say yeah it says th see on the screen there and be determined at all yeah and that's really key for us because there is no doubt in your mind that this has any psychoactive properties at all because we do see I mean children take it so much and my family my relatives my friends clients that come to us ask them that you're giving it to their children it's very important I can say hand on heart there is zero psychoactive element in there not true rather than just oh yeah there's less now yeah we just eliminate it completely yeah okay so go come back to the CBD that we have here again talk about the quality of it talk about the concentration this trains a little bit in a second or so but can you overdose no as far there's been zero reports of overdosing because because this is something you naturally produced in your body cannabinoids that's what's in that bottle cannabinoids yeah and a little bit of a carrier oil whether that's coconut oil or hemp work but that's totally natural as well yeah so everything in there in terms of the compounds that cannabinoids we we are we are known to produce them ourselves yeah so you you can't take too much so we will talk about dosages and how much people take or how many how much people take for different conditions but if you had half a pipette there's a quarter you're fine there there's no problem okay and what about if I'm on medication different kinds of medication what's its relationship with that so everybody is different again I've not had one single report at all of it interfering the medication but always check because because what it is doing is restoring balance in your body right now I can talk to you actually about my own experience with this so I've been on the highest doses of medication for my epilepsy for eight years or so mm-hmm and they kept trying to stop my seizures from happening and nothing worked nothing worked nothing eventually medicine came through and I have been on the highest dose of the medication I can take four for eight years until this came in now I along with my doctor said okay I don't want to be on strong medication for my whole life yeah because it has its own effects on you it's right numbing and I was tired and so what I've slowly done is taken as much CBD as I think I need and reduce my medication now I've done that with the support of my doctor and I would always recommend that you ask the question yeah always that chat with your GP yeah I'm a living and yeah there's nothing to be there's nothing to hide here there yeah absolutely it's encouraged and more and more doctors I mean we've talked about this before doctors are coming through saying we've got actually I'm not sure if Elliott can find it but we had a doctor he was anti all of this right I've been in the medical medical profession for a long time and he is apologize has come out and apologized and said I was so wrong I'm so sorry and he's one of the biggest supporters now there is dr. Sanjay Gupta one of the biggest supporters of CBD right now and please research him because he's he's so famous and he's such a credible person to to tell you all about the amazing benefits but yeah going back to your question it's safe but but ask the question that's so high and that's it about education empowering ourselves pooling our intelligences but yeah do check with you obviously with your with your personal GP or the yeah speak to speak meet two people and get to get that advice as well any side effects have you known off of these we've had we've had no reports of side effects and I thought we can ask something nice we I mean because we're dealing we deal with people daily yes from having anxiety through to cancer through to Parkinson's I mean serious serious serious illnesses like we discussed on that list and you think with the amount of medication they're on mm-hmm with how they're feeling anyway even if they confuse their nausea with taking CBD but we have not had a single person come back to us and say I've had this negative side of us extraordinary is it is extraordin painkillers or you know things that we take some people will have a negative start most people won't but some people will have a negative side effect this we have had zero side effects reported actually now as I say when you can it is available elsewhere well what I'm asking you right now is what makes the pro life CBD different in its quality that's the simplest way that is it a lot of people are selling CBD because it seems on trend at the moment yes same with anything that happens and I look we've seen a lot of people close down in the last in the last year including the company that sold as the dud CBD photo be in the first folks they've gone and will see that more and more its pro-life CBD is going to be the best CBD available well because we make sure we come week that we are up to date with new press and I've seen this area I've seen with you on Toby you're so incredibly power about and also what I'm actually buzzing about that what you've you brought to us are the different strengths so you looked at the 8% yes now the 20% strengths can you talk us to who would you recommend this sauce this is in the the middle bottle here okay so this is 10 millimeters let's use this for that is currently a best seller and it changes all the time but 20% okay this is for people who generally found that 8% is giving them amazing results yeah yeah and that is it is incredible for for that reason because you don't necessarily need more than the 8% but people just love it and want they want they feel like they want to help them as much as they possibly can it doesn't actually necessarily work that way if you if you have the 8% you can still take more of it like I said the quality is the same throughout yeah it's not the 20% it's better quality the quality is the same throughout it's just stronger so you need to take a little bit okay so the strong it's a yes it's quite self-explanatory out of 10 but yes and strongly is the less you need to take perhaps so you can manage it yourself and so if you if you if the 8% is got four I think it's four milligrams a drop uh-huh yeah they're about yeah yeah and and the 20 will be 10 10 milligrams so it's very popular though endure all probably unfortunately it's very popular because we have a lot of people now coming to us with very serious conditions right okay so not everyone needs to 20% but there's a lot of people that have serious serious problems that need the 20% and actually we've got requests for an even higher percentage which we're looking at yeah but that's basically what it supports for more serious conditions but it like we said earlier you can't take too much with anybody so it's just this it's the strongest quality sorry the stronger strength that we strongest percentage yeah and I think we touched upon it earlier when I was doing research and research and research and I know you there's nothing you don't know about this but when I've looked elsewhere and the the a percent is the lowest percent we have here but that seems to be beyond of some people's highest percent that's why we do it you know we truly believe if we're honest we could offer a 20 pound bottle bottle if we did two and a half percent or five percent we don't believe that good enough effects yeah and so for the extra 20 pounds 10 pounds 30 pounds how much value you put on your help this is the thing and we think there's no point in offering a lower percentage because it doesn't do enough that's just our philosophy just what we believe why yes we are stronger than everyone else and maybe a little bit more expensive than other people but at least we're seeing massive benefits from that customers it's just the home of quality CBD it's experience has the highest quality so just to recap so we've been looking at the 20% which is in the hundred mill bottle again with the pipette that looks like a 10 mil forgive me 10 mil so 20 percent all the detail on the screen the Oh 800 number and must stress as well and they're all popular this again for many is there the one of choice by getting it's down to your which one you're liking the look off or or Lottie will subscribe to these as well so yeah the number there are 800 number to get involved and ok so that was a little my taste but I've tasted it it's a very distinctive taste it's not exact it's a how did you find out if you haven't tried these like nothing I think that it's an earthly it's not unpleasant don't get me wrong it's not unpleasant at all but it's not it's I can't sort of compartmentalize it feels I said organic feels it's real come to that yeah so yes we talk about that but we use well we used offer as the carrier oil so it has to go into an oil it has to be in a carrier oil and these three that you're seeing today are in MCT coconut oil okay which has a hole so this is another sch\u00f6nox ane so just very briefly what are the benefits of having it with coconut oh well it's it helps with your metabolism it's bacterial it's it just has so many so many health benefits on its own yeah so it's just good generally for your health people take I mean my mum takes a spoonful of coconut oil every morning just yeah just another supplement well we we love here at problem we love coconut it's always a welcome addition to why we did it because we thought well if we can put it in coconut oil hemp oil is also amazing yeah and we used to offer that that was very earthy yes no I think this coconut oils neutralized it a little bit so it's I I feel more like I'm taking coconut oil than the hemp was a little bit more earthy a little bit stronger in taste but I my preference well in fact not just not just me we followed our feedback and as you know you can pay a premium for quality coconut oil yeah no please yes increase the price here or anything that I so know now I get the benefit of that as well and timeframes there's always intrigued me about things like this and so so so somebody tries lost that with do I feel something straightaway what's the how long should I take it forward ongoing yeah well your sort of thoughts on that it well I kind of touched on it but didn't expand early wrong because it's so much to talk about so yeah it this is what blows me away every single day and I don't get used to it and this is why I can't see it we can't sit here and talk testimonials because I cry last time poppy and I were both in tears you didn't show it just to if you did miss that show I know many many of you will of course it and you did show it poppy yeah it was quite emotional though it is but it's emotional all the time because like I said we started this because Toby was poorly yeah not because we intended to help the world the feeling that you get when you're helping so many people yeah and they are so thankful it's a long talk about right that's it there are just a moment we flush them up they're awesome on the problem living website as well yeah please do have a look and and and have a look at any reviews because they are amazing and we don't shy away from them at all they they fascinate me every day we have a new problem every day we have a new new illness every day we have a new review and it's just incredible to thousands and thousands of people that come to us and thank us will come to us and say please help me it is the most rewarding thing I've ever done and that's why I don't see it as a business I don't sit here as I do sit here is founder of relaxing but you might be so proud and I can see that coming from you and we're very proud to have the partnership as well I'm proud that we found it yeah I mean there are shortcuts we can make it cheaper you can make it quicker we can use other I always think you down pay this is what I'm saying I tell you never put that of the amout the work that goes into say the extraction the safety and he yeah you know I think sorry going back to your question you gone off on a tangent know what what amazes me more than anything else first of all there in the cannabinoid system and the fact that it exists and can do this this oil from a plant can do something so magical yeah but you I've witnessed and please look at this on line because it is one of the most amazing things you will ever see in your life I have witnessed somebody having an epileptic fit or somebody physically shaking with Parkinson's stop within seconds mmm-hmm how how is that it's it's a miracle to me yeah it's very moving it's extraordinary it is so the answer is yes immediate immediate so not everybody don't get so wrong not everybody feels in the median but if you think what I just did the top what moments to be feeling now he said people who are in pain people who have arthritis people who have Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety panic leaf illnesses are sleeps huge so you can take it before sleep and I guarantee if you've never taken CBD before if the first time you take it you will have one of the best night's sleep you've ever had because and the reason I can guarantee that is because every single person has given me that feedback we've talked before about Poppy's nan Tobi with his sleep because he was so anxious when he was poorly sleep was amazing but it does have an immediate effect because we've seen that in the likes of epilepsy Parkinson's and also the lovely lady who was really struggling with panic attacks is adjusting her dose at the moment because she's getting anxious going into busy situations right a shopping mall a meeting yeah somewhere somewhere where she feels that it's gonna be a lot of people that's what she struggles with yeah a lot of people do right you know to some level it's always do different volumes of it absolutely the biggest biggest topics well in the world right now yeah mental health is people talking about it a little bit more willing to talk about it great yeah it's a bit more as you say more people are I don't know is it more open more open more education towards it but as you say people are people sharing and we're coming across something like CVD that's actually giving people an answer which is so amazing not everybody wants to take prescription jokes not everyone wants to admit that they possibly have something that they need help with yeah this is a natural totally organic natural that you're not taking drugs you're not taking anything from from a pharmacy yeah and people are much more comfortable with that yeah I mean we're getting there there's always been this stigma around the the psychoactive side the THC as more and more people are coming to us listening to us there's a lot more education a lot more doctors scientists researchers yes saying this is safe yeah this is changing people's lives we're getting there very slowly and so it's I mean everyone's just going going crazy for it and of course as we say hit primal living always checked with your GP your doctor for advice and again ask those questions about empowering ourselves and again the emphasis of Juno will here at prom living is education learning those facts so you can make the informed decisions as opposed to scrambling in the it's crumbling in the in the dark we've got the big bottle to talk about now okay now this is big I mean we'll talk about them well it'll work what you're getting okay okay say this is the big bottle yeah okay and the strength of this 10% yes so sits between so it's this was the debate at the beginning what do we do what strengths what sizes and there's a constant requests for different things okay can I have a 40% gonna have a 30ml but still kinda happy we're working on it but trust us we're getting there that it's what do we do how do we do it effectively cost-effectively for you if we would see the 20% for example in a big bottle yes I'll be talking a lot money right and so it's we're trying to meet your needs absolutely but we're just deciding on where we take it next so eight percent as an entry level people want to try it yes they don't necessarily want to buy big bottle immediately understandable that's why we have the eight percent in the small bottle twenty percent in a smaller bottle again to help with the price it's the 10% that's where every single member of my family that's what they've got yet so that's there oh yeah the middle ground uh-huh so I find if you ask me I had if I had to pick one bottle that we could only supply one bottle it would be that one because I find most people that's where most people are well families are all temperament family size your question is family size bottle - no you're right actually it's them exactly that for we've had a lot of people who have tried and then said okay I want all my families to take it yeah and exactly that it's on it's there in the kitchen in the morning everyone has their their dose and off they go and so just to put again so you're putting this booklet so if you were taking the recommended dose of you drop's a time how long guesstimate would you say a bottle of the size would last you yeah it's difficult to say because of because you decide how much you take but as a rule I would say six months Wow okay and that that it is the most cost effective way yes terms of price per drop that's your bottle yeah and that is for everybody most people go from the eight percent quite quickly to either the twenty will attend because the ten percent gives you that longevity so you don't have to you don't have to worry about ordering three weeks later yes and of course you have the subscription though so you can do do it however you wish but that does last yeah so I would say my grandma and granddad yeah about six months in there's two of them so that's that's my benchmark for them but it's it's the most popular bottle foot what people say okay I need this in my life yeah I'm gonna take it every day then that's the boss they go for that's acetate okay so you can see the all the oils and the size and the strength on the on the website on the graphics right now you can see the big family bottle or the big bottle if it's just for you which is ten percent and I mean this is extraordinary just again for people just just spin it Victor on Terry and say well I appreciate what you I sit I've seen it elsewhere lower price what's what do you come back to that it's available but the quality is inferior quality yeah it's everything I don't mean to put everybody else am so that's not fair either okay there are good companies out there and CBD bottom line CBD is good the problem is it's how you how its extracted yes so what else is in that bottled it yeah you don't want to be taking ethanol you don't want pesticides you don't want any any nasties in there yeah some people are cutting corners and therefore you have got nasties in them or you will see a more affordable there are still good companies out there offering more affordable yes but it's two and a half cent so you'd have to take so much of that to feel the effect of one drop of well more drops for one drop of irate dissent yeah we sort of asking the questions I believe many people asking at home but I've done so much research on CBD and I'm not seeing anything like anything like the quality you're getting here out there this kind of a price value sorry sorry I've just passed again it's hard not to get passionate when you hear their stories and and and I feel as though we're doing a disservice because we have an hour show which is a long time and but we should be down as far as I just on that note yeah I can sit here very confidently and so I do not believe there is better quality available in the UK America we've basically taken that amazing company in America yeah I bought it here we've we found out where they got it from why they were so good why this little girl was you know went from 300 seizures to nothing so yeah and we wanted that and we said that's what's missing yeah and that's what we are providing is there's nothing we can do better nothing and now you might have called net all-natural ingredients to go yeah you brought an image of the of the farm can you talk us through there we go that little well big him blow that is Colorado a for you so look out look how laughing that looks I like to walk through that wonderful now families we mentioned and can see be CBD with what's the deal with children it's safe to take yeah all well what circumstances would a child be given to a child for example okay so any that's the thing is in what in one respect is no different to adults I mean we started like talk about that little girl it's very very common in children with epilepsy no probably one in the when I first started researching CBD that's probably the biggest thing that came up yeah always check again always check GP yes medication yeah and especially for younger children yeah that can't communicate with you just always check the reason I've grown ups who want to explore this is an avenue obviously getting the advice first questions it's so common yeah like you said it's so common that children take it there was a Elliott we got is an art school just friend of ours Jo sent it to me the other day and I love this because so many people like you are passionate this is the first time we've sat in talks about this and I can know what you tell you're passionate so many of my friends and family are passionate so many of our clients more passionate it just picks people up along the way they're the more people and it's just hard not also people are so excited to tell me things yeah are you mentioned a research team things every day and our friend Te'o sent us an article the other day about how about breast milk actually and how research has found confirmed that cannabinoids occur naturally in human breast milk and look if you just look at that quote it's one line from this article according to the findings of several major scientific extends human breast milk naturally contains the same cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant which are vital for proper human development now what that's basically telling us is from the moment that a child is born they are getting cannabinoids from breast milk it's extraordinary so this is why I say this is what we are providing CBD is they cannabinoid yeah the difference is you might you might hear endo verses fighter and doe cannabinoids are from within us we reduce them 5 towers plant yeah that's it so as far as I'm concerned please look online have a look there's a lot of research and scientists and doctors that support children taking it and the results that children are getting for epilepsy and certain certain diseases incredible again and I don't know many many of our customers become a Pasteur's for in their own in their own yeah there's no impassionate way but of course do check with DPS and doctors before just we've got the South which is a remove is the is new rave and buzzing about just before we get there just something about travel laws Airport when you did touch upon it earlier and watch see what's the deal is could I take it to the airport for example or what you need to do is just check before you go then it's legal in the country you're going to so there is we need it on our website actually but if you've gone on to primal livings website there is a list of countries as to where it's legal might it's not there are a couple that it's travel size in the in the year and in most OB where I've been I've taken him yeah but check check and don't want you to get confiscated at the airport because you wait in trouble that they will confiscate it from you you know you don't want that so just make sure that wherever you're going it they accept it and also do a recent checkers look as things change laws are changing so that it's become legal in so many countries over the last few years which is great but yeah just a couple couple I came behind just double check ok this South and now everybody in the office buzzing everybody again with customers as well so talk us through the stuff so this way of doing a target to local Ike toca target though you talk to be on the skin so it's Lindsay description that's exactly that it's the same way for example you wouldn't necessarily way I can think to describe it this I always think work from the inside out so for any kind of illness take the oil that's what I that's how I yes see it just think it's your best way however you wouldn't graze your arm right take a paracetamol necessarily yeah and I think of it in the same way you puts a blood on it and the brands are available sorry but you'd put a cream on it for example same thing if you've got a spray yeah or you've got something like and psoriasis is a big is a huge thing at the moment yeah in fact one of my lovely clients recently has been I've never seen anyone so excited that her psoriasis has got better from this self that and you apply it topically like you would a cream so it's targeting a specific so I still say take the oil I mean I've every one who buys herself I say take the oil as well because work from the inside out yeah but for something that is more of an external problem and is the anti-inflammatory yes it's got I mean let's just it sorry I'm just checking it has got in here and I always have said because of that much in there we've got the coconut oil we've got the beeswax we've got the argan oil we've got rosehip oil we've got geranium oil we have eucalyptus lavender essential oil and then cannabinoid which him so it has got the there was actually a there is I won't name names but there is a fantastic moisturizer that I use it I think it's the best in the world basically what we've done is taken all the ingredients of the one of the best moisturizers and added in the CBD which is of course what will help the healing process and I'm noticing an absence for example of petroleum and things you know that can crop up everything I mean you could eat that if don't don't but yeah and it's there's nothing harmful in there it's all totally natural absolutely and we know we absolutely adore our essential oils here at prime anything so this is the the Sal and I really in the production before as well be said Nicolas make sure you say it's well stocks last I was gonna say because probably said earlier that the staff is really popular really limited and we are also limited so unfortunately we are behind a little bit in because it's been so popular we're struggling to keep up with demand on well on everything but especially itself just one thing while I remember as well with the self not only for skin conditions enjoyed pain I've never heard so I didn't expect this so many people have reported for things like cold sores and just have spots okay yeah up quickly it's got rid of them yes of course we all know how long spot can hang around for all code so unfortunately and swearing by unfortunately I haven't I haven't had one you know but all my word people are swearing by that yeah I resides as well repetitive strain injuries yeah so this post surgery yeah yeah post-surgery foot recovery alongside physio proposed rain it's everything I mean everything you can think of where you would think to apply for example heat yes all the opposite poles that's what it's gonna do for you yeah but also this equally skin conditioner as a moisturizer people use it as a moisturizer people use it as a lip balm mm-hm because it's natural so everything you're putting on your skin is natural can I use on my face yes yeah so the only thing I would say about that if I'm totally honest you can use it on your face a friend of the family recently had really bad acne and put it all over her face the only thing I would suggest is you do that at night time okay cuz it isn't all it is oily still yeah and so I put it on a night time and then it's on for that period of time wash your face in the morning because yeah I'm not sure how I make it would react with it yeah I haven't tried that but that's what I would suggest is that almost put it on as a night cream if you're gonna put it on your face okay and havoc so we talking it's 50 ml inside yes and how much CBDs in this we have got 300 milligrams in there okay so that's what we have found everything that we do is based on research basic yeah yeah what's what what's needed we don't want to put more than you need in there and that seems to be the the amount that people are really getting benefits far as the optimum yeah of level and concentration the the bomb by the way is very when you open it it looks quite hard once you get going with it it's it becomes more malleable but that is also to make sure that you don't know that happens a lot with natural ingredients anyway he hasn't it you have to study gonna make it more malleable okay so there in a nutshell with the with the cell what can it help with with itself in their self anything external any so grazes and this is where kids come back in as well I mean the amount kids fall over and you just put yeah interestingly because my daughter's knees gets tougher for than white boys days yeah Jesus well you know we scarlet running around so yeah so we absolutely right so so perfect that exactly but of course like you said only arrived after the gym that's popular for that muscle soreness post surgery and anything external that you think Xmas Isis yes and most skin conditions in fact every skin condition that we have helped it has worked with if you're concerned like we keep saying if you're concerned ask your doctor but generally you can apply it like you would a moisturizer or like you would other creams that are available and you just rub it in yeah well it will get to work I'm thinking about after shaving perhaps as well again yeah great so the great thing about it is I also use I use an aloe vera a lot yeah you can't ally beer with Sarah Leon to open skin of course yeah so for things like cuts I had made this mistake with Charlie my stepson and it jellyfish yeah sting yeah I know oh yeah oh my word he went through the roof because it was still actually even though it didn't look like an open yeah weave but it's still so saw so as much as I love aloe vera brilliant and this doesn't have any of that stinging property so you can put it directly on a cut gotcha so whether it's because some people are such bad skin conditions where it's almost that open open wound open sores but actually this is very soothing there's nothing in there that will make it sting mm-hmm so yeah after shaving be great and you've seen the deals here just extraordinary please I mean I'm gonna do it my personal email address out again it's Nick at primarily living Calm it's Nick and I see cap please feedback to what your experiences and enjoying the growing groups of people who are so passionate and that CVD and passionate about this particular quality that we've got here so just go over again the the size of the bottles and the strengths as well and just feel free survive survive was leaving stop with to drop the what you sky was an entry level eight percent that's where everyone starts nearly everybody starts and I would advise it because if you are coming if you are currently taking something from somewhere else yes and it's a lower percentage see the difference I want to experience yeah I want you to experience the difference between a five percents from somewhere else yeah I'm taking our 8% because I want you yeah there it would be yep see the difference yeah and it you can gauge from that whether you need more yes so if you're getting through the 8% ball so quickly you use it you might think okay I want a high strength or people stay at 8% and that's just enough to you know as a daily supplement fantastic so that's the ten mill at 8% yeah and then we've got jump to 20% in strength again with ten mill yep with ten melt so that is our highest strength currently and that is taken by well there's two ways of looking at it it's taken by people with more serious illnesses who need the higher strength or want the higher strength mm-hmm or it's taken by customers who maybe want to take less so of course if there's four milligrams in an eight in the Apes impulse will per job yeah ten milligrams in the 20% bottle per drop you just have to take less so yeah it is premium popular at the moment I think because people want to be taking as much CBD as possible but same quality same quality within both it's just how much you ingest okay gross we've got about a minute left on show so again a perfect forum travel size with these smaller bottles and we described more as the family size now this sits percentage-wise in the mid-water down the middle between a 10% 10% that's what we have found to be the most popular requested suitable yeah presenters that people want and that's a hundred mil and that's hundred bill the reason why it's a hundred mil is because exactly that people want to buy in in a big box and it's in the cell now as

Matz thank you so much for joining us give us a ring and make these yours", "qbOUTqFfr6E": "[Music] hello kannaway nation this is Janelle came here I'm here today to educate all of you on a few topics the first one that we will be covering is bbong formulas and my wish is that you have the tools that you need to be able to share these formulas with as many people as possible and positively impact as many lives as possible while making an incredible living for yourself you can search high and low anywhere in the world and you will never find products like we have for you here at Kenway and that is because what we bring to you our v bond formulas combined with CBD bbong formulas are defined as secret formulas these secret formulas have been handed down through my family lineage from generation to generation the bbong formulas are rooted in the teachings of the great doctor hojun who is from korea he's a renowned herbologist who is known to have written one of the greatest medical encyclopedias of all time which is called the domi Volcom this book is actually currently being studied by some of the top medical schools in the world because of the incredible information that he has to share regarding the human mind body and how to have the most optimal condition possible our bbong formulas where once only available to the royal court this is due to the fact that they were so powerful that the royal court didn't want to share them so this is an incredibly special moment because for the first time in the United States and really in the world here at kannaway we are sharing our bbong formulas on a scale that has never been done before so what is it bbong formula you can really break it down into three simple key principles the first principle is a bbong formula first and foremost has to be secret it has to have been handed down from generation to generation through a family lineage number two and one of the most important things that we have to understand is that bbong formulas are proper formulations anyone can take a whole bunch of herbal ingredients and put them into a formula and call it an herbal formula this is not necessarily herbology true or biology is the ability and the knowledge and the wisdom to take those herbs and understand them so completely you know how to take each herb put it into a formula and make it so that is completely balanced so although each herbal ingredient has amazing functions when you put it together that's when the miracle happens a proper formula has the ability to go into each person and because of the knowledge and the wisdom of that formula and every herbal ingredient they're able to go inside and correct all the imbalances in that person when you have balanced it means that everything flows everything functions and that really is the key to anti-aging and optimal health which leads me to the third principle which is it works for every individual's condition regardless of your age regardless of whatever imbalances you may have regardless of the lifestyle you choose to live the significance of a proper herbal formulation is that it is able to rebalance one's Qi and that is the key to anti-aging and optimal health so of all the important points that we went over today about bbong the most important thing to remember is that these formulas work when you hand out these formulas you will see the difference and you will hear all of the amazing testimonies that will come and I promise you they will and I can't wait to hear about him [Music]", "nNDtn0H4878": "I am sorry there is nothing left to", "eoGDedQdL3U": "you may go unit I back up whatever you say like this has kind of a more even feel I'm like hello even reopen hi youtube 'yes i'm back and i'm reviewing go green hem i have two bottles one is orange and one is unflavored looks like this you can see it is a 500 milligram bottle and it's 30 milliliters they both go for around 39.99 i believe it was the actual price on their website theirs they also have a cinnamon flavour but i'm only reviewing the orange and the unflavored for right now so in the mail it came with these packages Hedison spit in my travel case so they're kind of jagged right now but come in those little packages and it comes with a little pamphlet telling you more about the CBD i'm gonna start with the natural one the unflavored natural so i check this one before i had a show and i had a little bit of anxiety and it actually went away I took about I think five to ten droppers and I didn't have any anxiety while I was performing that was nice it did not reduce so sometimes I take CBD before I drink so that I don't get a hangover the next day did not reduce the hangover did nothing for the hangover I had a hangover but you know maybe that's because the alcohol I drink or how much I drink who knows oh I also traveled while I was taking this one I took three droppers before I got on the plane and I didn't have an anxiety for my whole flight I also noticed that compared to the fab CBD this which was the same milligram content fab CBD worked a little bit better for me I had to take more go green than I did fab CBD and I usually like to take less if I can so for me personally I'd rather have something more effective but go green is actually very useful because it did get rid of my anxiety so it is still a good choice oh the taste was very very we'd like it wasn't it wasn't as strong as blue birds we'd kind of planned he taste but it still you could still taste the cannabis and yeah it was clearing colors that was nice moving on to the orange go green hemp so this one tasted heavenly it tasted exactly like oranges it was like this is the best tasting CBD that I've ever had if you can't do the whole wheat taste with your CBD I would highly recommend getting the orange one because it's an amazing phenomenal I tried this one for pain I had cramps because it was my time of the month and I took it it didn't really help for my cramps I also used it for oh I also used it for two things that I had and it didn't really diminish any pain or I didn't notice a difference at all but it didn't work for anxiety like the other natural one did so that was nice it does work for you you guys are out there looking for a CDD for your anxiety this one is something I would recommend I also tried this one for it's a hangover thing and it didn't help for the hangover that I had after I drink another night but usually after drinking I get anxiety the next day and I did not give it anxiety I felt a little bit aloof still because after drinking also get like well kind of believe things I had a splash like yeah feel a little funky after drinking I still felt aloof but I didn't have high anxiety after drinking which is wonderful overall I really liked both of these I would definitely opt for the orange because it tastes amazing but if you're into the cannabis taste and maybe try this one too yeah go try it guys I'll leave the links below", "uJio7n-alzg": "hello everybody happy saturday it is it's so well what day is it it is saturday february the 27th yep and we are here at the burning bush personal

so feel free to hit that subscribe button if this is something that you find interesting or useful today we'll be reviewing the medication gabapentin we will be taking a look at what it is its uses the dosing some side effects as well as some precautions to take into account if you are taking up a Penton or if you are considering it just a little disclaimer before we start this video is for informational purposes only and it's not intended to be a substitute for medical advice from your physician please continue to follow any specific instructions provided to you by your local healthcare provider or providers it so gabapentin is a prescription medication that is available either as a tablet a capsule or solution it is marketed under the brand name neurontin or horizontal or growl eyes org release as some people prefer to call it and it is available either as an immediate release tablet or capsule or an extended release formulation the two approved uses of gabapentin are firstly as an adjunct in the treatment of management of partial seizures and what an adjunct means is that they're by painting by itself may not be used to treat partial seizures but it may be used in conjunction with other medications the second use of gabapentin our fda approved use is in the treatment of post-apartheid inner algea this is a condition where there is a lot of pain due to damaged nerves which results as a complication of shingles so sometimes when somebody gets shingles the person may be healed there rushes disappear and everything but there's been some damage to the nerves and this causes pain gabapentin is used to manage that kind of pain interestingly one of the most common uses of gabapentin which is the management of that a peripheral neuropathy is actually not an fda-approved use it is basically an off-label use and what off-label uses of medications are that the medication was not necessarily studied for that condition but over the years they realized that it actually helps in that condition and based on the doctors experience he be prescribed it for that particular condition off-label uses of gabapentin or non-fda-approved uses include fibromyalgia hot sweats and sometimes even I said pre-emptive therapy in acute post-operative pain so they figure out that this person has had a procedure they're gonna be in pain preemptively they may give gabapentin to prevent the pain from occurring in the first place other off-label uses include in the management of hot flashes due to menopause it may also be used in the management of pruritus which basically is itching it can be used also in restless leg syndrome in single toes which is just a fancy name for hiccups as well as alcohol dependence with respect to dosing the extended-release formulations like relies may be given once a day while the immediate release preparations are usually divided throughout the day usually maybe two or three times a day the dose is usually capped around 3,600 milligrams because beyond that you start increasing the incidence of adverse reactions and as well as there is really no proof that beyond three thousand six hundred milligrams you get any additional benefit it is also not uncommon to see that those titrated gradually upwards so say somebody will start with a hundred milligrams at night and then gradually over a period of time as in us depending on how well the person tolerates the medication that doctor be titrated upwards until they desired therapeutic dose next we will tackle some side effects side effects include dizziness which occurs in about 28 percent of the adult population across 17 percent of and about 3% of pediatrics so we're talking about approximately one in three adults experience some kind of dissonance while they take gabapentin others include somnolence which is also predominantly in adults about 21% hypoglycemia has also been observed there are also a host of psychiatric side effects which are usually experienced in the pediatric population this include hostile behavior hyperactivity mood swings and sometimes disturbance in thoughts and like I said this usually occurs with the kids and the occurrence rate is around about 5% of the pediatric population which leads us to the next big one which is suicide ideations some people tend to have suicidal thoughts and I'll talk a little bit more than that when I deal with precautions other side effects include peripheral edema which is accumulation of fluid in the usually the lower extremities we also have the usual suspects nausea and/or vomiting and also some people may experience fatigue or lethargy another common side effects is ataxia ataxia is the condition that mimics being drunk in there is slurred speech that stumbling that's falling and for the most part there's a lot of in coordination some people may also experience breathing problems which I'm going to address more when I talk about the precautions now moving on to the precautions and the very first one that I want to mention is the ability of gabapentin to cause suicidal thoughts typically this happens in pediatrics or kids but it is definitely not completely absent in adults so it is definitely worth taking a load off especially if you are a parent of a child that is taking it to keep a close eye and you as an adult also it's definitely recommended that if you see any kind of mood changes you you have to seek help it is estimated at about one in every 500 people that take gabapentin may experience this obviously to varying degrees the second precaution retrospect together anything is to note that it has the potential to be habit-forming it actually has the potential for abuse as a result a lot of the states if you are watching this here in the United States though it is not a federally controlled substance a lot of the states are pushing to make it a control substance just for that reason and in one of the states where I'm licensed now in Virginia I know for sure that gabapentin is not a controlled substance so that is something definitely to be worried of whenever you start taking gabapentin thirdly it is recommended not to discontinue gabapentin abruptly anytime you want to go of gabapentin do you want to work with your doctor or your healthcare provider because they will most likely taper you off especially if you are taking it to prevent seizures may result in a condition called status epilepticus where you have continuous seizures so that is something to be very careful about not to discontinue gabapentin abruptly or as we say don't stop it Coulter also as recently as December of 2019 that's just a couple of months ago depending on when you are watching this video the FDA came out to put out a specific warning about gabapentin affecting the breathing of people who are already at risk of breathing problems such people include people that take other opioid medications concurrently or any kind of medication that affects the central nervous system as well as people who have COPD for such people definitely work with your doctor they may be some dose adjustment needed or they may be you know some way forward so that you don't find yourself in a situation where you have breathing difficulties due to taking gabapentin I'll put a link to that specific warning from the FDA in the description below so if you care to read about the whole thing it gives a whole lot of guidelines what to do what not to do so that's gonna be in the description below now if you become pregnant while taking gabapentin would be a good idea to talk to your health care provider about registering with the north American antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry this is a registry that is set up to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs you know you're in pregnancy so it's free to join you there's a lot of information there I'll put a link to the website in the description below as well if you are interested there's also a phone number I'll put a phone number there as well so you can check it out so that's a high-level overview of gabapentin feel free to leave your experiences in the comments below if you

because they say that it helps with joint back pain and inflammation so I was like you know what let me go ahead hop on the bandwagon let me see if this stuff really works and honestly for the past two weeks this has been like a miracle in a bottle like honestly like it was to the point where I could not even stand for long periods of time and so I'm really glad that I finally took the job and

making anything that has water in it you need to use a preservative if you do not use a preservative it can only last up to seven days in the refrigerator I'm as late as one with them if you do a DIY and you do not use the preservative it will only last up to seven days in the refrigerator so I was on a couple of websites a couple of blogs and I really didn't understand the 1% or the 2% amount I was like really really confused so somebody else was like check out Bree hauls video she explains it perfectly check out her video it will be linked below but I did take a screenshot and I'm gonna explain it to you guys as well but definitely check out her video so the first thing you're gonna do before you even get started is you're going to measure your mixing bowl empty I use ounces but use whatever system you use alright so after everything is mixed you are going to weigh that you are going to subtract the mixture in the bowl from the weight of the empty bowl all right that's going to give you the amount of product you are going to take the amount of product and multiply that by 0.01% and then that is going to tell you how much preservative you need to add oh my gosh it's that easy but all the websites that I went to that was that hat like a preservative calculator I just couldn't get it I couldn't understand it and she explained it so perfectly I'm a flash it up on the screen so definitely shout out to her and she said that she'll be posting a lot more videos about preservatives and stuff like that so definitely check out her channel and thank you guys for watching if you have any more questions let me know in the comments below and if you're gonna try this body butter let me know as well you made it to the end thank you so much for watching as the special bonus it

Now, what I mean by that is, when you take\nsome kind of oral supplement or an oral compound, you have a level of degradation that occurs\nsimply because your digestive system breaks things down. Now, does that mean that it's bad? No, absolutely not. Does it mean that oral compounds don't work? Absolutely not. That is not what I'm saying, but what I am\ntrying to allude to is the fact that if you have a specific area where you're trying to\nget some relief, let's say in the way of maybe some stiffness or anything like that, well,\nCBD can work in a transdermal topical form, and because it ends up skipping that oral\ndegradation and that gut biome degradation, you might have a better chance of relief at\nthat given area. You see, a lot of the pain in our body can\nbe indirectly or directly triggered by what is called inflammation. Now, one of the unique properties of CBD is\nthat it helps promote the healthy modulation of inflammation within the body. So, what that means is that it works upon\ninflammatory cytokines, things that would normally trigger inflammation, and a lot of\ntimes you'll have these inflammatory cytokines or have inflammation at a localized source. So, in essence, if you use some kind of topical,\nit makes it so you could potentially directly affect that inflammation at that very spot. You see, one of the major roles of CBD is\nthat it slows the cytokine production of immune cells. So, when you take it orally, you're working\nat a systemic level, but when you take it topically, you're working at the very topical\nlevel, although you do have some effect that still trickles down to the system overall. Now, additionally, CBD is unique because it\nactivates what is called the TRPV receptor. Okay. This TRPV1 receptor is also known as a vanilloid\nreceptor, and it controls a cell signaling protein, if you will. So, it controls this mechanism from the top\ndown, as far as inflammation is concerned, which is pretty neat. So, when you're looking, again, at the modulation\nof inflammation within the body, this could be a really cool way to target some of your\njoint pain, maybe some of your stiffness, things like that. Now, let's jump over really quick to a study. Okay, this interesting study was done on rats. Now, I know what you're thinking. Because it's done on rats, it's not applicable\nto humans. Well, no, it still is applicable. We could still take the common knowledge and\nthe common denominator from this study and apply it over to humans. So, this study took a look at rats that had\narthritis. So, they induced arthritis in their specific\nareas of their body, in their joints. Okay? Then they applied four days of 6.2 milligrams\nof CBD topical. Okay? It was really interesting what they found\nout, okay. They found that it significantly reduced the\njoint inflammation. So, what they found is that the joints, on\naverage, went from 72 millimeters all the way down to 65.6, in just a four-day span. Now, millimeters, we're talking small little\nrat joints here. So, that's a lot. So what they're finding is that the inflammation\nthat comes in from arthritis could be modulated by the CBD in this particular case. So, we translate that over to how it could\nwork for someone's given ailment as a human. You can see that there's a lot of potential\nbenefits. Pretty wild stuff. Now, the cool thing is, is that you don't\njust have CBD coming into the equation when you look at Octagon Biolabs. Okay, there's beeswax in the mix, okay, and\nbeeswax draws moisture into the skin, which is really interesting. So, it makes it so not only the skin is healthier,\nbut it makes it so that you're going to be able to hold in the compound a little bit\nbetter, as well. Additionally, MCT oil, which is going to make\nit so that there's a little bit more of a moisturizing effect, but also lavender oil,\nso there's a calming effect, and lastly, eucalyptus oil, which has a unique property when it comes\ndown to being antibacterial, but also being calming and potentially anti-inflammatory\nas well. So, when it comes down to utilizing CBD for\na specific thing within the body, a topical CBD might just be the solution for you. So, there are a lot of ways that CBD can affect\ndifferent things within the body from an anti-inflammatory standpoint, acting upon endocannabinoid receptors\nlike CB1 and CB2. But when it comes down to brass tacks, being\nable to directly impact where your pain points are, or directly impact where you're having\nsome bothersome issues, that might just be the quickest line from point A to point B.\nSo, as always, make sure you're keeping it locked in here with Octagon Biolabs. I'll see you soon.", "4QHezCJf6dg": "what is up guys so I am back after a very eventful weekend 2019 and Boston finished out three-day event so I'm actually pretty lucky I got to got to get my hands

topical CBD products are also geared to help people suffering with eczema and psoriasis and other skin challenges you'll also find CBD oil popping up frequently like in cosmetics and skin care

systemic problems the best topical cvd products don't just mask the pain or inflammation as some over-the-counter topical pain relief creams do this is because of the high concentration of cannabinoid receptors on the skin can burn wide receptors are part of the body's endocannabinoid systems a by wide system discovered in the nineteen that affects many important functions the chemicals produced by the body that interact with the ec system are called cannabinoids and like THC and CBD they interact with cannabinoid receptors research done by Halpert in collaboration with the company Med Terra CBD and Irvine California has found that CBD is able to turn down the production of inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor alpha which is made in an overabundance by people who have conditions like rheumatoid arthritis another study published in the journal pain in 2017 found that prophylactic treatment with CBD stopped the pain and hindered the development of more pain in rats with

to talk to you about some of the cd/dvd products that we're going to be selling here at the studio so this is what it looks like the company is called extract harmony it's my friend's company the man behind it is Tim he's my one of my best friends and he and his scientist Derek came up with this brand and the products and they're really amazing so what we have here is three different kinds of CBD oils and different dosages so there's a 300 milligram 500 milligram a thousand milligrams so this is the same product it's just a different dosage and then there's a self here a suit it's called soothe what it looks like is this and it's a topical so let me talk to you about the company is local there in LA and they have a warehouse now in Long Beach as well so by buying these products supporting local business and yes so let me talk about CBD so CBD is super hot right now it has amazing health benefits and I'm just really excited to get it to people in the studios we have to say that we can't claim that CBD does anything because in California in America the FDA has banned marijuana as a schedule 1 drug so there hasn't been a lot of testing on CBD now the difference between CBD derived from hemp and CBD derived from the marijuana plant is that the CBD derived from a hemp plant has absolutely no THC they can have up to a certain percentage but these products here have been tested and they have absolutely zero traceable amounts of THC so if anyone wants to use these products and they're afraid if they're like a government employee and they're afraid of getting like a ping on a drug test these products are safe to use because they have absolutely no THC in them which is kind of a bummer because a little bit of THC helps activate the ingredients in CBD but as a yoga studio we a dispensary so we can't legally sell anything that has any THC in it okay so CVD we have to say again alleged benefits the only two studies that they've done for CBD specifically are for anti-seizure so they've found out the deaf studies and found out that it helps with seizures and also anxiety they've done studies that have proven that it helps with anxiety now there's been studies done in all over parts of the world that prove the other benefits that I'm about to say but we have to say claim just to be on the legal side we have to claim alleged benefits so some of the alleged benefits of CBD it can reduce pain it's a huge int anti-inflammatory it helps reduce anxiety wishes are even proven it can relieve nausea it promotes cardiovascular health I'm reading from a little paper here it's help it has antipsychotic effects it's also really good to help people get off opioids it's a natural it's an all-natural way of people to get off of those prescription meds without the side effects that the opioids and without the addiction so but again we're not doctors so we can't prescribe anything like that we can just let people make their own decisions in Maitri seizures and other neurological disorders it helps lower the incidence of diabetes it can promote heart health it promotes bone growth and it helps with in savio may help with insomnia so let's see tell you about the product so what CVD is is they get their CVD from a factory in the Netherlands who that precipitous EVD isolate and it comes in the form of a crystal like really small crystalline structure and it's 99% pure CVD isolate and then they take that crystal and they infuse it here in California with different so in in these ones it's infused with MCT oil it's all organic everything's all non-gmo MCT oil and then in here so that's it just CBD isolate high-quality CBD isolate and organic and MCT oil MCT oil is medium chain triglyceride oil from coconut oil and that in itself has all kinds of benefits that it's an antiviral it's an antibacterial it's easier to digest the most other facts so this is good MCT oil and then in here it's the CBD isolate the crystal combined with organic cocoa butter organic shea butter organic mango seed butter organic hemp seed oil organic beeswax and then of course the organic CBD so there's two different things um let's see so this dosage if you take a dropper of this it's ten milligrams if you take a dropper of this 500 milligram one it's 16 milligrams and then of course this would be doubled this is actually 33 milligrams in the thousand the thousand milligrams CBD tonic so this one it sells for 50 this is sells for 80 and this sells for 140 so everyone can get something at a price point that's good for them and then these ones I forget these are 30 for these shoes so these go on topically anywhere that people have inflammation pain arthritis so it's good to like rub it against like the knuckles or like elbows neck it'll help soothe like muscles and with all of these you want them to be done consistently consistency over time will help show the benefits with these oils you want to put them under the tongue you want to do it sublingually as opposed to eating them of course you can heat them too but it gets rid of a lot of the powerful benefits of it because you're it's going through the the liver and the kidneys first and the first pass metabolism I think that's what it's called it's written here you see yeah first pass metabolism and it if it's swallowed you just avoid all of that so try to put it under the tongue hold it there for 60 to 90 seconds and then it'll get immediately absorbed into your bloodstream so this is for like if people don't have a lot of pain they just want to do like everyday a little bit under the tongue a little bit before maybe before you when you wake up or before you go to bed depends on what they want it for it kind of helps balance out the system you have all of these receptors CBD receptors in your brain and in your body and this helps just balance everything else so maybe if you need a little energy it might give you energy help balance things out if you need relaxation it might do that as well so for me I take this thousand milligram under the tongue before bed and it helps really relax me this is better for people who have a lot of pain again it doesn't have any THC in it THC definitely helps more with the pain but this is definitely going to help like relax and relieve things this is also good everyday use yeah and there's still a lot of things that we need to learn about it but overall it's an amazing product and I'm super excited to have it here you guys have any questions this ends up being way longer than I thought if you guys have any questions please feel free to text or call me and if I don't know the answer I can call the owner and get the answer from him so yeah excited to be selling these in the studio",

allow 5 to 15 minutes for pain relief effects to occur while the cooling heat continues apply it respectfully as needed be advised to stay away from open cuts or wounds and discontinue use if

labeled at having 50 milligrams of THC and 5 milligrams of CBDs while the other otherwise identical bottle was labeled as 50 milligrams of CBD and 50 milligrams of THC overall I give a path econo

if you don't have seasonal affective disorder it can still help kind of boost your mood in the morning and i'm one of those people that i don't drink coffee in the morning i just turn this on and i put it somewhere like in my peripheral vision you don't want to stare like right at it you just want to put it somewhere where like the light is hitting your retinas for at least 10 minutes every morning so i'll just put it like somewhere like on the counter while i'm brushing my teeth or whatever in the morning and then i'll get that extra boost of energy to get going for the day so definitely worth checking out i'll put the link below so you can see it for yourself so for the fall definitely you know since the days are getting shorter and it gets darker and darker outside

cozy but it has like a little pocket somewhere right here yeah so i can only put stuff in it you know there's a zipper and there's a pocket here so i can put like my little essential oil in there or my face mom um face cream um but yeah it's really cool i haven't really come across other things like this they had the little zipper in it with the pocket um last but not least is my favorite beanie from jet set diaries i love beanies especially in the fall i like i kind of look forward to this all summer to be able to wear my awesome beanie it's so comfortable it keeps me nice and warm um so those are my favorites let me know which one was your favorite [Music]", "DCbCrqtqvyc": "[Music] hi guys it's Brandi from green wellness life thought I would chat with you a little bit today about capsules they do come in different sizes strengths and variations and I get a lot of questions about those and what the differences are because there can be some different price points as well I do also have a lot of people ask me that if taking CBD in a capsule is just as good as taking it in a tincture or a raw extract form you know my answer is generally the best CBD is the one that you'll actually take every day so if you know yourself and you know that that grassy earthy hemp flavor that comes from a tincture a raw extract is not for you know you're just not comfortable taking it in a liquid and you'd rather take a capsule then by all means do it the capsules can take a little longer to get to work for you just because your body has to digest them before the CBD can start to do its thing but the end result should be the same for you whether you're taking it from a tincture or a capsule so I might say that I've got three basic variations of capsules soft gels traditional powder capsules and then what I call a hybrid which is kind of somewhere in between the two so soft gels I have right here is from Entourage oops almost ripped it this is just encapsulated hemp oil you can see it's kind of a light and amber color it's squishy and if I were to stick a knife in the end of this guy then that oil would squeeze right out so I actually have some customers that say that they like to buy these capsules just because they know their serving size because those milligrams are sat per capsule so they actually buy these I'm just a competitor a knife in the end squeeze it out under their tongue and go on about their day so I have soft gels from Entourage from Tuesday hemp oil and also from Plus CBD so these are just the traditional hemp oil extract that's been encapsulated next one is or the other end of the spectrum I guess we should say is the traditional powdered capsule and that is just what it sounds so this has been through more processing to take that CBD oil and get it down to a powder to stay and then fill up these little Koen capsule guys so this is been a little bit more processed these are from plus CBD great product super popular and a little bit lower price point but it is it is surprising to some people to see that it really is a powdered capsule so really traditional then we've got what I call the hybrid in dhoka falls into this category as does CBD FX so that's another one that I would call a hybrid so looks more like that first softgel a little bit squishy but you wouldn't be able to just stick a knife in the end and squeeze the oil out there's more of a paste and this it's a little bit thicker consistency paste like but not full powder and capsule so kind of somewhere in between the two those I have in all different variations I've got 10 25 and 50 milligrams strengths so I think it's an easier way likely for the manufacturer to take that humble extract not worry about thinning it out or adding any oil carriers to make it a soft gel but kind of leave it as sort of that waxy middle ground definitely thinner and not powdered but not a full-on soft gel so those are kind of the three variations personally I prefer a soft gel or in that middle hybrid which I'm sure is not actually what they call it but that's because I'm kind of a baby and I don't like to take regular capsules it's just not my preference as a human so I like the soft gels but everybody has their own their own preference and in their own best way which is why we do carry multiple variations because they want to make sure that there's something for everybody so I hope that this helped a little bit and I hope that you have an awesome day always email or give me a coffee you've got any questions that email is support at green wellness live.com

I'm Veronica Nene I'm a producer and a PR person I'm always in the round jumping from one appointment to the other one and barely having time to greet I'm a working mom and one of my friends noticed that I was having a lot of anxiety and smoking a lot she gave me an advice try CBD vapor so after that I decided to give it a chance I did my research and I found green low-dose hemp I was so studied because they have so many products and I decided to give it a chance to the pan and I bought this lotion it has so many human properties that I decided like why not I'm smoking less than before and

countless number worldwide that suffers from arthritis do you have chronic pain from a past injury or are you somebody who constantly finds themselves in the medicine cabinet for a pain killing pill or cream if you're watching this no doubt you've heard of CBD cream and probably heard that it helps with pain but does it work for arthritis doesn't work for chronic pain or muscle soreness and is CBD cream better than CBD oil for pain relief well give me a few minutes of your attention and we'll address these questions and a few that you might not have thought of yet so let's start by looking at what CBD cream is and how it's supposed to work well CBD oil and cream affect your endocannabinoid system which is important in regulating things like hunger mood memory and yes pain because of this early studies believe that CBD relieves pain in a few different ways the first is by helping your body produce natural endocannabinoids that relieve pain in needed areas by slowing down metabolisms so the body can help focus on healing the next form is by helping to repair the damaged muscles when you strength train or strain your body in a way that is not normal you create micro tears in your muscles the body's natural response is to send inflammatory mediators to help the repair in CBD by limiting these signals can relieve some of the soreness and pain without slowing down the healing process lastly CBD is believed to fire pain receptors that naturally release heat and soothe pain this controls your nervous system to help heal rather than inflame with the science out of the way the question becomes does it actually work the answer is yes with a slight reservation since 2011 there have been five major studies that show CBD cream helps to reduce our thready spain inflammation and muscle soreness unfortunately this is not enough evidence for any medical organization including the FDA to approve CBD oil or cream as a medical treatment for arthritis now considering trying CBD cream over CBD oil for general health we regularly recommend CBD oil for a lot of reasons but for pain inflammation or muscle soreness there are a lot of benefits for the cream version treating one area directly with the cream should be faster targeting relief to the affected area plus the CBD cream is focused on one area and it may last longer than its oil counterpart we know that this video just scratched the surface of questions about CBD creams and oils so we are offering a free ebook to really inform you about CBD and make sure you have all the information you

Eden and I am the owner of Wella c-calm and welcome back to another installment of our review segment today I'm super excited to review a brand new CBD topical from our good friends over at koi CBD and if you've tried any coit products you know that they are nothing short of high quality and incredibly effective so I got some high hopes for the koi CBD healing balm so let's go ahead and uh take a look at some of these products so when it comes to the healing balm there are two options so there's the big boy such as this and this is in the box and this is the container it comes in and this big big bad boy has 500 milligrams of the koi prism true spectrum hemp oil doesn't have any THC in it so you know it's got some CBD CBD v c VG some cbn you know it's got a varying profile of cannabinoids without having the THC in it and then so 500 milligrams in this bad boy starts at $59.99 llc.com and then um if you want to give the healing balm a try and without you know it's forking over the 60 bucks they do have a travel size of the healing balm which on the anal has a 150 milligrams in it but that one starts at $19.99 so it's a great way to start out and experiment with the product to see if it's right for you and your personal needs because let's face it we all require different products different potencies and so you know we're all different so it's important to experiment and find what works best for you and your personal needs and if you stick around until the end of the video or actually if you just check down below you will also you will see an exclusive discount code that you can use to get 15% off your first purchase of the coy healing balm from Wella c.com so like I said guys the koi healing balm it's got the the koi prism true spectrum hemp oil so you know I kind of look at that as sort of like a broad spectrum kind of formulation because it doesn't have any trace it doesn't have any THC in it so you don't don't worry about that and also what's in it is it's got some essential oils you know it's phenomenal essentials you know let's take a look so it's got like some grapeseed oil yellow beeswax Granite coconut oil peppermint oil eucalyptus leaf oil rosemary leaf oil sweet basil oil spearmint oil lavender flower oil and that's just beginning there's many many more in there so I'm really excited to give this a try because with all of those essential oils in there you know you get some of that aromatherapy going once you apply it under your skin really relaxing then you also get the benefits of phyto cannabinoids from the hemp plant you know such as the CBD the the CBD v the cbn you know the varying cannabinoids without any THC of course guys it's I do want to keep pointing that out so koi a healing balm I'm going to use the big bad boy today because I just love the packaging guys like look at this right on the cap you know it's a wood engraved cap it has the koi logo right koi CBD logo right on it's just it's beautiful alright and you know just high-quality packaging a nice glass container with a nice wood lid you know it's it's solid all the way so you just open this up and ooh ooh so oh its shape so take it out the box so I actually had one out of the box already so you take that like so boom boom and what's really awesome you know it's got some the ingredients on there directions for use you know simply you just using a CBD topical or CBD salve this is what it's referred to as this is a salve does it's thicker consistency it's not like a lotion it's kind of like sort of like a Vaseline kind of consistency but it doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy for extended periods like Vaseline you know so it's really easy with SABS you simply just take take a glob on your finger I mean just rub it right on the plump the problematic area you know it's really effective for those large deep muscle groups that you've really got a massage deep so though you athletes if you experience an injury you know I was dealing with some shoulder pain a while back and reach for the coy healing balm and let me tell you it was really really effective for me so I'm excited to review this product with you guys so pop it out the box right here you know it's got the 500 milligrams of coy healing balm we're sort of sticker right there other than that you know down at the bottom it's got directions for use on it also the ingredients which is a win-win the only thing that I don't see on here that I would recommend for coy I mean I checked the COAS they're spot on there they're great but the only thing I would suggest for coy I'm not seeing it's just because they have it on all their other products is just adding a QR code right under the packaging just so you guys as the consumers can quickly scan it with your cameras on your phone and then you can just verify because it is important that you always verify but let's be honest guys when you're buying from a company like coy CBD quality is of the utmost importance when they're in their manufacturing process to see simply do not have to worry about it so let's go ahead and give the coy healing bummer ago ooh you know I could smell that eucalyptus the lat or the the peppermint oil in there ooh and then the lavender you know I feel like I could smell it is it like some lemon I feel like I could smell a little bit of a oh there is lemongrass oil I was getting a little hits hints of lemon in there ooh there's even some cinnamon leaf oil in there which you know I think would be great for you know kind of like a sort of warming kind of tingling sensation because let's go ahead let's let's actually stop smelling it and actually try it for ourselves so I boom so as you could see guys just a thick little ol glob like that I mean depending on your large muscle groups you can you can adjust it so just like with all SAVs and CBD topicals when you apply it to that local area it'll only provide the localized relief so I recommend pairing I call it the two prong approach I recommend pairing a topical for really outside your body in those localized areas and then also using a CBD t-shirt such as the Wella C full spectrum MCT oil tincture so then you get relief outside with the topical and then inside your body which is the whole body relief using leveraging a topical soul all right so let's go ahead and I'm actually just going to I'm gonna rub this right on my I'm gonna do it on my elbow and also my shoulder so you guys can see so as you can see I'm rubbing it on ooh right when you start putting it on that ooh those essential oils really start to go to work mmm it smells incredible I mean you know just those aromatherapy benefits just from those essential oils like I'm relaxed already guys um you know I could this should be phenomenal to put on you know right before bed you know I mean that's not to say you could use this all during the day because you're not going to smell nasty like bengay it's just gonna be really refreshing and actually so I rubbed it in um and yes so I mean my skin is a little greasy but it's nothing like Vaseline but I mean I just rub I rubbed it in a lot you know you really want to get it in there lather it in there but man it made my skin so incredibly soft and I always get this wow this is really noticeable with the koi CBD healing balm the koi naturals Wow so right when I start rubbing it on I always get sort of like a tingling sensation like I feel like that's the phyto cannabinoids you know the CBD and other cannabinoids that are present in this formulation are really going to work and stimulating my endocannabinoids receptors because we do have them on the skin and that's why CVD topicals are becoming so so popular is because you got a local you've got a specific area of pain that you want to really you to relieve you just rub a the koi CBD healing balm right on it and wow I feel the tingling and like even my hand like you know I can feel it like it's kind of low greasy but honestly like I just rub it in my hand so there's no waste and my hand like I can feel it but it's definitely absorbing rather quickly like I don't see this like I wouldn't have a difficult time grasping things you know writing on stuff so if you're at work and you have some pain that's like some inflammation that's quickly that's a you just pull this out of your your desk you know that keeping the full-size one of your desk or even the travel size in your purse or your a backpack and then you just pull it out whenever you need to relief and wow that that is really really good it smells very refreshing which I I'm a huge fan of this smell don't get wrong it's not you know a lot of topicals out there you know with the especially the lavender you know I feel like they smell a little more on the feminine side of things but you know this this the lavender the ooh the lemongrass you can get that absolutely phenomenal smell so the effects that I'm experiencing so what you know my elbows been kind of bothering me you know I don't have like tennis elbow or anything but you know I kind of fell on it and so but it's actually you know the level of you know I was just kind of kind of hurt a little bit when I was moving it it was just kind of stiff but you know it's really moving I mean it feels like it's loosing it loosening up a little bit um you know the CBD will really start to it takes a little bit P absorbed I mean it does go into work right away um but if you're experienced a high level of pain you know I would definitely give it about 20 to 30 minutes I'm once you put it on to just have really gauge the effects to see if that's right for you but scent I you know I got to give this smell a 10 out of 10 it's very refreshing you know so like I said you know that peppermint oil so it really so once you apply it on you know it immediately starts going to work you know it's kind of like it's sort of like a warming sensation but it's not like you know it's not as crazy as icy hot at all it's very it's very very mild but I do feel the relief taking place and you know I'm actually going to do is a little bit of shoulder pain and this is always my issue especially back pain the shoulder and back pain because I work on a computer all day on there for at least 18 hours a day so my muscles are really tight and stiff and oh my goodness like my neck especially that oh yeah I'm gonna put a little bit more on my neck and oh yeah see guys that I already feel it starting to really sort of alleviate some of the pain and stiffness in my neck up because guys if you can feel my neck you know there's a whole bunch of knots and everything so I would love nothing more than to get a full sort of massage leveraging this koi natural CBD healing balm ooh I keep saying that it smells really good but it's super refreshing relaxing guys like once I put it on I just feel relaxed and also those essential oils or leveraging that aromatherapy so when you're inhaling that you're getting that aromatherapy and then the CBD and the other phyto cannabinoids and the formulation are also going to work you know fighting off that inflammation and another thing you know even if you don't have specific pain you can also leverage this healing balm as a moisturizer because I didn't touch on that my skin is very very soft and you know I have an issue on my neck and my back or my neck and right behind my ears get really really dry I don't know if you can see the redness but I think oh wow that yeah that healing bump I would apply to every where I mean I it says I would not recommend putting it on your face necessarily David say that right on the packaging just to avoid your face and eyes you know because if you can get that there's essential oils and stuff that are in the formulation into your eyes I could you know kind of burn but you know it does it really that cooling sensation janeshia lee is really really good and it's kind of like a cooling warming sensation it's kind of like a little bit of both you know I really did notice that once I put it on my neck you know I it's yeah definite I feel it moisturizing because my neck was so dry incredible moisturizer you know I'm loving the effects that I'm feeling initially now I got it I got a wait a little bit you know to fully gages so I'll probably come back and let you guys know and about you know twenty to thirty minutes to see how I'm feeling and then yeah we can touch base on that because I do want to always touch on the effects you know granite they're all gonna be different from what you and I experience but I think it's important for the sake of this review that I give you sort of some insight on the effects that I'm experiencing leveraging the koi healing balm what's up guys so you know it's about been about 20 or so minutes since I first applied on the koi healing balm so I played it on my shoulder and also my arm and then also my neck because I had that muscle stiffness you know and also some stiffness in my elbow um and also what I wanted to test is um I experienced some some dry skin behind sort of like my ears or upper neck area and let me tell you it took away the dryness I mean my skin feels incredibly soft and also let me touch on that in regards to how it feels um the greasiness that you kind of felt initially that i discussed when i first put it on it's completely gone my skin is just looking healthy supple and just very very smooth looks very shiny smells good still on those essential oils that i listed off are still kicking and strong but yeah i was really kind of worried because i've experienced that way stabs where there's an overly greasy miss with it after an extended period of time and i simply don't like that because you know especially if you're at work and you got to play that on you got crap all over your hands and i hate you know wiping it on stuff because that's just a waste of the CBD so as you saw with the what I do with the koi CBD healing balm is rubbed on the elbow then rubbed it on my arms my neck and then also the any excess and just rub it into my hands and my hands don't feel greasy they're just incredibly soft and smooth so nicely done on that so I did what kind of want to um you know come back pause the video and come back and let you guys know sort of how the effects the effects that I was experiencing you know but about 20 minutes or so in so very very solid on that core I'm super impressed they definitely eliminated my concern with it being overly greasy but also like this stiffness in my neck you know it's still sword it's not like CBD isn't a miracle you know but it is in a sense but for me you know the pain is still there but the soreness and the overall like stiffness has really been subsided so I just feel like I have greater range of movement in my neck and it doesn't really hurt I don't feel like I just have like massive knots in my neck so nicely done and you know I'm definitely going to be reaching for this coin natural CBD healing balm the next time I have a migraine you know rub it right on my neck area and then about like my upper neck right at the bottom of my sort of head and then also leverage our tincture and I really think that would be a match made in heaven you know that's just one of the uses that you can use for the koi Naturals CBD healing balm flavor or scale of 1 to 10 that I would give it just based off the smell alone 10 out of 10 no doubt about it and then the effects that I'm experiencing you know my neck I feel like my neck is the one problematic area in my back that I feel the inflammation really kind of being subsided a little bit you know the pain still there but it's definitely it's providing me a level of relief that I would be happy with um especially if you're at work or something where any level of pain you know if you can mitigate that any even just a minut amount I think that's a win-win especially if you're in a work environment school environment where that can really kind of deter your focus so you know on the overall effects and I'm feeling you know sort of the well the skin sort of nourishing benefits that I got one just based off the softness my skin feel because it's been on my arm for you know about 20 minutes now to 2025 minutes my hands they just feel really soft smell great but they're not greasy at all you can pick something up and also my skin it's not greasy but I will say it's very very shiny and it's very very moisturized so that's great um you know being out here in Colorado it's a very dry climate so if you live out in a dry climate as well such as Colorado not in Arizona or something this would be very good just for the moisturizing benefits but the pain relief and the overall benefit and experience that I get rating it on a scale of one to ten I got to give that an eight out of ten this is by far one of my all-time favorite CBD topical as well and this in this instance a CBD salve it is my favorite one absolutely you know very solid score the packaging is beautiful I mean cool you guys knocked it out of the park on this one everything you need you know is right on the box the only thing that are the label two blocks beautiful packaging even more beautiful but you know the only thing I'd suggest is adding a QR code just to make it super easy for customers such as you guys to access those COAS because in this industry especially with things that are going around there's a lot of negativity so

what's going on guys another video for you another kind of like healthy you know supplement style thing we got going on here this obviously per the title is what it is and I'm sure somebody that watches this channel is going to be opposed to it just because usually you know the gun guys and gals and stuff like that and you know patriotic Americans conservatives Republicans whoever you are out there or against the weed in the disc that no thing this isn't weed this has no weed in it has no THC in it but it is CBD oil okay and it's koi brand five hundred milligram there is a bunch a bunch a bunch of reasons to take this stuff a couple years back I hurt my back pretty bad at work I was out of work for you know seven eight nine months and I still feel pain every day for the most part some days it's better some days it's worse you know it all depends and sometimes it keeps me up at night and I can't sleep because of it I can't get comfortable and it just sucks it really just sucks and I've been researching you know CBD and stuff like that for a while now and you know I came across koi you guys know I do the vape thing you know so I'm in and out of vape shops a lot and they've been carrying all this stuff as of late at least the one that I go to and they've got a wide variety of brands and different types of ingestion for your CBD you know they've got oils like this which this is like a tincture little dropper for one you're supposed to shake it up but you shake it up real good and then you take a dropper put it under your tongue hold it under there for like ten seconds and then swallow it this is the pink lemonade flavor from koi it tastes like cough syrup really but it's not that bad it's bad it's just one swallow and giggity and you could also vape this too I feel like it's definitely more efficient to do the tincture it absorbs quicker you're not wasting juice well you guys could do whatever you want here's a look zero THC made-in-america gotta love that here's the ingredients you know and so CBD itself you guys do your own research you know don't believe me do your own research especially if you're opposed to it but look into it because there's a lot of benefits to using CBD and it's totally legal it's a hundred percent legal in all 50 states there's no drugs in it there's no THC there's no nuttin you don't get high when you take it you know there's no euphoric feeling there's nothing but there's a lot of added health benefits to it it helps with inflammation it can help with pain it helps you sleep better at night there's it helps with anxiety and stress and depression and all types of different things if you're if you don't have an appetite it helps you gain an appetite you know if you're sick you have cancer stuff like that that's the other thing too is it may help you know with cancer or cancer like symptoms different things like that there's a wide variety of different studies on CBD and all the benefits that it has and there's a lot of people that take it anywhere from young to old I assume you got to be 18 at least to buy this I don't know if it says or not but it's definitely gaining in popularity and it's definitely helped a lot of people to the point where there's even been like major news stories on CBD and the people that take it you do have to be careful because some brands there's like a legal amount of THC that is allowed to be in the CBD and still be legal I think it's like point zero three percent or 0.1 three percent or something like that along those lines and if you do take enough of it and on a regular basis there is a possibility that you could fail a drug test even though you're not getting high you're not smoking weed you're not doing the pots you know so that is something to be concerned about but from all the research that I've done koi does have zero like completely zero THC in it and you will not fail test using this I don't know I've only been taking it for about a week maybe a little bit more than a week everyday couple tinctures of it a day you know one when I wake up maybe one in the middle of the day one before I go to sleep and so after this bottle is done I'm gonna go to Walgreens or wherever and get one of those at home drug tests for weed and I'm gonna piss in it and I'm going to see if the tests positive and if it does then I'll probably stop taking it unfortunately even though I've already felt benefits from it but I'm not going to risk you know a job or my rights or any of that stuff for this the main reason I've been looking into it and trying to take it is because the regular medicine you know advil Aleve vicodin whatever it is like the actual medicine the pills you know you go to Walgreens or your doctor gives it to you it might help but it's not natural and you can get addicted to that stuff and it's it all the side effects are usually worse than just dealing with the pain from you know whatever it may be your injury or or whatever it is so this is natural you know it's you don't have you can get it any time you want you don't have to wait for a prescription you know you could buy as much as you want different dosages like I said before this is a 500 milligram there's thousand milligram and I believe even 2500 milligram obviously the higher the dose the stronger it'll be the more effective it will be there's also ones lower than this but for me I have noticed an improvement I felt less pain my back hasn't been bothering me as much you know any type of stress related to work or just life in general seems to be not affecting me as much and then on top of it the best part of this is I'm getting better sleep you know I usually you know I'll get home from work later at night whatever it is and you know I've been at work all day so I want to I want to do something or I got work to do doing YouTube videos or whatever and you know sometimes I don't go to bed till 11:00 12:00 1:00 in the morning sometimes and but with this you know I I go right to sleep and I sleep soundly and I wake up and I feel refreshed where normally before I started taking this you know I'd be I'd be tossing and turning I couldn't follow this fall asleep and then when I did sleep I'd be waking up it felt like you know every hour on the hour trying to get comfortable again you know on the back was hurt and the neck was hurting whatever it is that all while taking this for the past week 10 days whatever it's been I've definitely noticed an improvement I've felt better I've slept better and that means a lot that means a lot because you sleep at night you wake up for the next day you got to go to work you got to do this you got to do that you're going to the gym you're hanging out with friends or going hiking going to the range you want to be the best that you can be you want to be as well-rested as you can be and this has definitely helped that's one of the things I can say it has definitely helped me rejuvenate during sleep and feel better and wake up refreshed and like I said you know calming down the stress not that I'm like totally stressed out and tweaking out man but everybody's got stress in life and this kind of you know I felt like it hasn't affected me as much without taking it I don't know if it's a placebo it's just in my head whatever maybe but I think it works I think it works and there's really no negative consequences to this whatsoever as far as health-wise there's only health benefits from all the research that I've done the only downside is that you might possibly fail a drug test but if you don't have to worry about that or if you know it's accepted by your employer or whoever you know they know you're taking it and you know it's legal there's nothing wrong with it plus there's a lot of companies that are even changing their policies and their drug testing to allow for this because this stuff is gaining in popularity you know not just koi in general but CBD and it really has there's a lot of stories out there if it really helping people and it's helping me so Pharr so like i said guys if you're into it if you're interested check it out do your own research don't believe anything I tell you and I will come back with an update in a week or two a couple weeks whenever this bottle is done it's a 30ml bottle so you know whenever I got a little bit left in there but uh I'll come back I'm not gonna do the drug test on camera obviously but I'll let you guys know the results and hopefully it stands true to what it says absolutely zero percent THC and I would pass the drug test and then that way there I would have no qualms or issues with taking this continually whatsoever and that's the thing too if you're going to buy this stuff you have to realize that it's not gonna work overnight you're supposed to take it for a little while get it into your system and then you will see the you know the the benefits and the effects of it a little bit down the road so that's something to throw out there it's something new for the channel something different and I wanted to share that with you because I know that when my back is hurting me it's killing me I know that if I don't get good sleep you know I wake up and I don't want to do this I don't want to do that you know I feel like crap you know then you're in pain you're you know you're upset you're frustrated if this can help with something just as simple as that let alone all the other better stuff that it can do why not you know so that's the video guys thank you so much for watching please

"s-vsrbVZrjQ": "welcome back everybody taking a break from cooking but we've got more delicious recipes perfect for a wintery cold day like today coming up in just a minute but first we're gonna talk to one of the pharmacists from hometown pharmacy JJ Allen from Oshkosh the Oshkosh pharmacy good morning thanks for being here thanks for having me so first before we jump into this topic a lot of people right now are sick with cold and flu and all you know you name it they've got it there's a lot going around you guys are there to help you have a lot of natural supplements that are you guys swear by and you know you're very approachable at Hometowne that's what you guys are all about yes definitely and I think the one thing that we focus on is keeping people well so a lot of our pharmacists are known as the pharmacists that don't like drugs but what we try to do is leverage lifestyle and nutrients first I think one of the products referring to is virus ed with echinacea and elderberry and zinc some things support the immune system that's very popular this times been very very helpful so don't you know don't just think you can handle this alone you know it's always a good idea to go to the pharmacist tell them your symptoms and they can help you you know get something that may help of course always you know if you're not feeling better get to the doctor but you guys were there yes also really quickly wanted to talk about some of the shop go hometown shop go pharmacies how you were going to be filling in that gap yeah so shop Co hometown pharmacy provided a lot of great patient care for a long time unfortunately a lot of them are now going out of business so we've been talking with a lot of the shop Co pharmacists to figure out if there's areas and communities that aren't going to have a pharmacy anymore we're looking to help fill in those gaps there are going to be a lot of communities in the near future we're gonna be filling those gaps that Shopko left but is with a heavy heart that we see them go because I've been great partners for so long but I'm reaching out to those pharmacists to make those fillings where needed and we'll talk more about that as you know the months go on but right now we're gonna talk about something that's a really hot topic right now you may have heard of it you may have seen it on the news you it's called CBD oil so first of all JJ what is it so that's a good question so see is a very very hot topic right now it's something that because it's something that's fairly new that everybody is kind of looking at as a panacea treats kind of everything I'm what we're finding is it's a good tool but a lot of the the research hasn't quite cut hasn't quite caught up to the height so there are things that it's been shown to be beneficial for mainly insomnia pain anxiety and so there are a lot of patients that we use it as a tool but it's not meant for everybody and there is some drug interactions and there is some potential issues with it so the main thing is talking to your pharmacist and doctor before starting any CBD oil and just like everything all different brands aren't created equal so that's really you guys do your research you you know you you get the brands that you believe in you've brought a couple of different ones at different forms so how does it come and you said insomnia and you know that's something I think a lot of us suffer from how would you how would it work yes that's a good question so first with the different brands so the just like the supplement industry the CBD oil in wood industry or now it's kind of the wild wild west it's not regulated like drugs are so with medications like ibuprofen versus Advil I'm always comfortable going with the generic unfortunately for supplements and CBD in particular that's not always the case there's a lot of products out there that don't have what they say they have on the label contain in them and actually can cause a lot more harm than good so first and foremost getting a good quality product the one thing I always that people look for as you can see on this box here it says I'm full spectrum so that all the studies of CBD oil they use the whole plant so it's not the CBD itself it's the whole hemp plant that's been effective for it so looking for the full spectrum and then second looking for certificates of analysis so the company we partnered with is ananda and again our pharmacists nutritionists did a lot of research into these companies to find one that partnered with the university thomas jefferson university that has done some of the most research on CBD oil and they actually have companies saying this is what's in there this is what's not you can actually go online and look up for each product exactly what's in there and that that's huge you know i mean if you're gonna I you better be buying the good stuff the stuff that they've done research on so it comes in a couple of different forms look there there is a you know a dropper like an oil dropper and what is the one in the tin yes so the oil dropper is the tincture that's the most common form that's under the tongue and that's one that it's been shown to have better absorption sublingually then then orally so the tincture is always people start and then the one in the tin is actually a salve there's not a lot of good data for topical use of CBD oil but it is very safe and there has been some people who have shown anecdotal benefits with pain and specific site inflammation for bug bites and things so this one has a topical salve but most of the data has been done on the oral tinctures so the ones under the tongue so you basically do what one or two drops under the tongue and that'll be something to make sure you talk with the pharmacist each person or dosing is going to be different and again yeah it's it's a tool not meant for everybody but most people would be one milliliter or ten milligrams under the tongue but it's gonna vary depending on medications age other disease states so something to work with the pharmacist the nice thing about you know you are in a lot of different hometowns so you talk to your customers have you had customers who you know let's say had you know couldn't sleep or had severe anxiety and they use a little bit of this what have you heard yeah there's some of our biggest success stories are actually people on on chronic opioid medications so a big issue in pharmacy right now is the over prescribing of opioids a hydrocodone and oxycodone so with pain we've had a lot of success with helping people taper off of these pain medications and using CBD oil to help augment that so that's been the biggest success for me and then we've had a lot of people also our goal is always help people decrease medications so decrease medications like ambien and result for them that are ones that are shown to help for sleep but they decrease sleep quality so helping people to leverage something like a CBD oil has been very effective for decreasing medications and improving sleep improving anxiety and getting back to normal function with the no need for medications do you need a prescription at all it's a good question you do not need a prescription for it as long as it's derived from the hemp plant which these products are there's no prescription needed but there is some gray area with it so again you're talking your pharmacist about which products are are legal yeah hometown pharmacies are all over the in the area jjl and of course is at the Oslo keishon but they're really approachable and you know it's like it says hometown like it should be so thank you so much for coming really appreciate it and stay warm with thank you and we'll put all the information and a link to their website on", "W4VyOl_t8s8": "hey it's sophie from cbd supply md and in this video i'm going to be talking about the rx remedies extra strength sport warming and sport cooling bombs this

know of course the 850 milligrams of the broad spectrum CBD but that isn't the only incredible ingredient in this truly spectacular CBD topical from Pachamama CBD in addition to the 850 milligrams of broad spectrum CBD the Pachamama CBD pain cream contains you know ingredients like menthol and capsaicin and if I'm saying capsaicin wrong please drop a comment below in and correct me you know I believe I'm pronouncing it right but you know hey call me out if I'm not pronouncing it right I'd appreciate it so you know the with the menthol the cap says you know this all of these ingredients you know there's additional ingredients as well but you know all of these paired together give your body a break from discomfort in a chance to heal itself you know if you're dealing with chronic pain you know in flow nation or you know you're just dealing from muscle soreness from working out you know just living an active lifestyle I would really reach for this Pachamama CBD pain cream because you know with the ingredients like menthol that helps to cool the area causing causing relief and resulting in it and inhibiting the effect on pain which is exactly what you want you know that menthol helps cool that area and it really helps to inhibit the effect on pain whereas the capsaicin helps to block communication between the nerves and actually enhances blood flow you know to provide that relief to those specific areas throughout your body those inflamed areas you know get that blood flow going you don't want to have it backed up or anything so that's why you know the menthol the capsaicin are in there but that's not all guys you know so in addition there's ingredients like MSM arnica there is a invigorating frankincense so I mean this bad boy will has a high has a potential to help you combat your pain now with that said we cannot guarantee pain relieving effects or any effects at all in regards to the Pachamama CBD products or any of the CBD products available right now at Wella si.com and if you ever run into a CBD company that's trying to sell you a product by making medical claims they are breaking the law and they're trying to hide something or make up for a lack of something in their product so I would not recommend that you purchase from Vemma would run far away and guys if you're interested in the Pachamama CBD pain cream check the description section below or wait until the end of this video and I will give you guys an exclusive discount code that you can use the 15% off your first purchase of the patre mama CBD pain cream now one thing I do want to point out and I'm going to be filming more review videos they're gonna be after this one is the other Pachamama CBD topicals because pain cream isn't the only one you know they got the CBD body lotion which has 300 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD in it then there's the icy muscle gel with 500 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD in it so you know those also do not have the THC in them so you don't to worry about it but and then last but not least is the Pachamama athletic rub which has 500 milligrams in it but I do want to point out the Pachamama athletic rub this is actually made with a full-spectrum pep extract so it does contain the trace amounts of THC all right so keep an eye out for those upcoming review videos I'll be posting them on the YouTube channels so let's get back to the Pachamama CBD Pinklon you know some of its uses according to Pachamama is you know for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of sore muscles and joints that are associated with you know sprains arthritis simple back ache muscle strains bruises cramps so you know for you ladies if you deal with some very severe cramps you know that time of the month this the Pachamama CBD pain cream would be great because you know that's what's beautiful about topicals is you put it on your hand and you you apply it directly on a on a targeted on a targeted area for specific relief now that brings me my next thing that i want to bring up CBD topicals only provide the localized relief so wherever you apply the topical that's where it's going to provide relief if you really want to take it to the next level and not limit yourself to localized area or if you're experiencing you know pain internally or other parts of your body you could really leverage what I like to call the two prong approach which is you use something like a topical like the pot from AMA CBD pain cream for that localized relief and then you use something that you that you digest you know or internalize so something like an oil a teacher a edible a Capps or even a vape oil so when you do that that'll provide the whole body relief and then the topic of ride that localized relief so then I look at it this way it's like you're getting relief inside and outside of your body or whole body relief so I highly recommend that two-pronged approach you can combine it with take the Pachamama CBD pain cream and combine it with one the other Incredibles incredible full-spectrum CBD oil tinctures which if you're not aware of those I have a review video on the well se YouTube channel so check that out or you know you compare with one of the other hundreds of CBD products that are available right now at with ww-well SC com all right let's give the Pachamama CBD pain cream a go I'm super excited look at this bad boy so 850 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD in this 3.4 ounce bottle it's a nice like look at this cuz this is a nice hefty sized bottle you know that they definitely aren't shipping you on this and you know one thing that I do appreciate is Pachamama didn't make a super big bottle with low levels of you know CBD like in a lot of products I'll see them come out in a bottle size like this and there'll be 250 milligrams in it so then it's not very concentrated so you're having to use a lot you know just to get a semi decent amount of CBD each use whereas box Rama CD paint cream with 850 milligrams and you know each pump is fairly concentrated you know a lot more than a 250 milligrams in this exact same bottle so let's give this a go alright so smell that definitely could smell the menthol I don't know if it's like maybe the arnica in there that I'm smelling maybe the frankincense I think it's got like a boat but I definitely smell the menthol for sure alright so I'll show you guys what it looks like so as this nice little air pump bottle you know keep this in your backpack you know your purse a disc in the locker room you know I mean you could put it in your pocket but it is kind of big so alright let's look at this so if you guys take a look at this it has a beautiful actually nice peach color associated with it okay I mean I put a pretty generous amount on you know experiencing some I've been sleeping on my neck really weird lately I think it's just like I move and I'm weird and I end up like waking up with a sore neck and you know it leads to knots and then that causes headache and it's just like a never-ending pain cycle so you know I'm gonna put some on my neck and kind of my lower shoulders and you know experience a little dry skin so we'll see what it kind of does for the moisturization aspect of it all right so you know just rub it in like this and you would just do this on wherever you're experiencing pain so you know right now I'm experiencing a little bit of you know the tightness in my shoulders all the / lower neck and then also kind of my upper neck so I'm applying it generously all across my neck and I'm maybe gonna put some of my shoulders you know so definite okay the menthol is already in action I can feel the cooling sensation in like I debit it like I was kind of getting a mixture of I think three scents but like now like that I've applied it and you know it's in action on my hand I do smell menthol but it's nothing like I see I you know it's not like I don't really like some of ice yet I'm not a big fan of it it kind of smells like alcohol II and just like I don't know I I don't like it and like this just like you could smell the menthol but like it's not like it's not like hitting you in the face but I will say as this Pachamama CBD pain cream you know it starts to go to work on my neck I feel like I'm getting a more potent scent of the menthol but it's still not like medicine the type smelling you know it it's a very refreshing scent and it's not like overpowering and I mean somebody I see out on like I I like it it's a very nice smelling you know it's kind of relaxing honestly and I mean it's that menthol is going to work I feel like the menthol just gets like stronger and stronger and stronger as it as it sits and starts to go to work on my on my neck or wherever you would apply it you know so I this scent I was just hoping that it was gonna smell like eyes yeah and it does not smell like that I believe like I think I am getting kind of a little bit of the arnica type smell us with the menthol which is really really nice and you know this Pachamama see this pain cream is a cooling topical formula with oils and herbs and compounds that work with your body to provide temporary relief from minor joint and muscle eggs soreness and overall discomfort so you know I'll kind of see towards the end of this video if you know you won't go to work like that I mean it's starting to work but I mean I'm not gonna like immediately display oh and all the pain is gone you know it'll take a little bit and you know for you of this your first time using CBD you know some people sure some people do report experiencing effects after their first use but some people you know they can take up to it can take a week but sometimes I and I recommend this for all of you this year first I'm taking a CVT product give it a full month of use before you decide if it's for you or not because sometimes it can take that long for the cannabinoids to build up in your endocannabinoid system to start working and providing that homeostasis you know the balance and equilibrium because that is the whole purpose of your endocannabinoid system and it being in charge of you know internal bodily functions that's its number one goal is promote homeostasis balance equilibrium so you know and if you feel relief after your first user even if you feel relief at all you know don't just stop using the CBD product because guess what if you stop using it the issues are gonna come back so it's something like if this works for you if like this Pachamama c be praying cream helps you treat your pain make sure using it regularly don't just stop using it you know and it's important that you just you use it and you need to look at CBD kind of like a daily multivitamin you know those wanted day gummies that you take you know you take those every day you don't take those every other day or once a week and say well I'm good you need to look at CBD products the exact same way it's very very important alright guys so I will say so off the scent I would give it on a on a scent scale of one to ten you know I'm I'm gonna put that in a 75 I really like that it's a little more menthol e than I was expecting but it's not like god-awful like the icy hot sore some of the other kind of menthol containing products that see you know in the past and it's great because the Pachamama cvd pain creams made with a broad spectrum hemp extract you know so you don't have to worry about having any trace amounts of the THC you know because THC is of course what they're looking for in regards to a drug test and I will say about this they menthol kind of intensive nassif you know like when I do that you know I I can feel the cooling but like it's kind of calmed down for sure but I will say it really moisturize my skin like my neck you know my lip my shoulder my shoulders were a little dry and you know that's an additional benefit that I got from it is I've noticed you know my skin isn't as dry and itchy at least on the direct the specific areas that I applied it on and that cooling action is starting to really really relax my neck so you know for me I am noticing some and I'm noticing some effects starting to work now I would have to continuously use this you know over and over you know for a month like I just said at least a month for me to be able to say like okay this really this helped with my pain but I can tell you like it is starting to you know loosen up some of that soreness and everything you know because I did come back on here and I kind of cut the video so here I am sort of you know about used it about 30 minutes ago and it is starting to work you know I I do feel it loosening up my neck and kind of adduced like my Ranger I'm not as stiff as I was before so you know so far I like it you know but it's up to you that you you need to experience this for yourself because even if you and I are treating the exact same pain just because I get relief does not necessarily mean that you will experience relief so it's very important that you that you try these products but also experience you know find a dosage that works for you but then start experimenting with different types of deliveries you know like a topical or an oil or using that two-pronged approach guys I'd really recommend that you do that use the Pachamama CBD pain cream and then you know you could also use one of the Pachamama CBD oil or you know one of the well SC CBD tinctures you know or vape it capsule you know just try it out guys but I highly recommend this pain cream I love the potency of this 850 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD and this whole thing and it's like I said a 3.4 ounce bottle so you know it's not you're not going to go through it like that I mean it depends on how frequently you're using it but it is a good amount of lotion and then also a fantastic amount of CBD now guys if you check the description below at the end of this video or I'll put it up on the screen right here if you head on over to www.hsn.com and that about wraps it up for the Pacha mama CBD pain cream review i had an incredible time reviewing this product shout

oka my name is Demi and today we're going to be talking about CBT suppositories their benefits what's inside how to use them and if there's something they might be able to benefit you our suppositories are about as pure as they come they're essentially hemp extracts some hip waxes and some coconut oil we didn't want to complicate the ingredients of our suppositories because most the time they're going into parts of our bodies they're a very sensitive therefore we wanted to keep the ingredients as pure as possible so we wanted to have some suppositories to show you guys but the box that Jonathan bought unfortunately is empty because it's actually used them all so not all men are weird about it but we know that some are so we're doing this video to talk about it to try and change the turbo a little bit right well now here comes the fun part so essentially suppositories are meant to be used and inserted into the vagina or the anus fun topic right believe it or not anal absorption for medications is actually pretty common that's because that part of our body is right next to a main artery therefore the medication when formulated correctly can be absorbed directly into that main artery and actually gets to bypass that first liver metabolism process meaning that we get maximum amount of medication in this situation CBD into our bloodstream and circulated around the body also using suppositories means that the CBD is going to be absorbed then administered generally speaking in the lower part of the body this means that if you're using the suppository vaginally for example a lot of our customers say that does wonders for menstrual cramps for endometriosis any kind of pain in that part of the body anal insertion means that anyone having issues with the colon particularly the prostate which is a super touchy and important topic for men to talk about as well it means that the CBD is being essentially absorbed directly in that area of the body therefore if you are having issues in that part of your body CBD suppositories for me is kind of a no-brainer suppositories are also a great option for people that perhaps can't swallow properly hate the taste of hemp or they find that hem drops or capsules just give them a bit of an upset stomach so how do you dose the suppository well most of our customers will take one suppository just before bed this is kind of important to know just because although the CVD gets absorbed obviously the oils and the plant waxes can't get absorbed so they kind of need somewhere to go therefore sound super unsexy but there might be some leakage therefore if you're using a suppository I wouldn't go out for a run or to go do the shopping best to do it just before bed wake up in the morning you're good to go like everything there's pros and there's cons so we know that suppositories are not for everyone also if you're not super dexterous in the sense of like perhaps you don't have great mobility perhaps suppositories might be a little bit difficult to insert as well okay so the benefits let's get serious here suppositories as so far we've seen in the studies that exist at the moment they have the best rate of absorption so if you are someone that wants maximum CBD or perhaps you need maximum CBD jokes aside suppositories are amazing whether you're a man or a woman however you want to use them however often you want to use them they're an amazing product if you want maximum CBD absorption and there's really nothing to be weird about when it comes to suppositories so to finish up have you guys ever use CBD suppositories what do you use them for have you heard of any amazing stories of people using CBD for suppositories in our community we've got people using them for prostate issues and Demetrios pain menstrual cramps plenty of things if you're curious to hear more about suppositories or CBD in general and the products people are using go down below and join our CBD Facebook group we have got amazing people there that can answer any question you have and we're always looking for new members and we love talking about everything CBD so come and join us there if you

preventive alternatives that better improve their needs for a higher quality of life it is no wonder that botanical options like CBD are gaining interest but what exactly is CBD cannabidiol is one of over a hundred and thirteen chemical compounds called cannabinoids found in the cannabis and hemp plants that bind to receptors in the body and are responsible for the effects of cannabis why is this important tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the most widely studied cannabinoid it binds to receptors in the brain that produce psychoactive effects but unlike THC CBD does not produce a high instead CBD binds to receptors found primarily in the immune system supporting health and homeostasis homeostasis is the natural balanced state of the body's physiological systems bio rains created they never-before-seen CBD / curcumin water soluble complex that is 100% bioavailable to the human body unlike other oils CBD products up to 60% of the human adult body is water according to HH Mitchell with the Journal of biological chemistry the brain and heart are composed of 73% water and the lungs are about 83% water very simply put bio rains products absorb into the body better while oil products do not absorb as well because oil and water simply don't mix join the highest level products in the CBD movement join bio rains today [Music]", "5KflhpfYzvQ": "your testimonials on your website these things run the gamut you know you have it treating sports injuries chronic back pain cancer radiation burns acne you're talking about circulatory issues you know especially for the for the folks out there tell us the science how do these oils and lotions work you know especially for such a wide variety of issues so my understanding of it which is limited because there hasn't been enough studies yet and I can't wait to learn more about how these actually work but my understanding of it is that the cannabinoids respond to your peripheral nervous system your you have an endocannabinoid system which we as humans have this yeah every human has an endocannabinoid system and it's kind of a regulatory homeostasis system and there's two kinds of receptors there's cb1 receptors which are in your brain and those are the ones that mostly respond to THC and that will give you these psychedelic or a psychoactive you know experience and then you've got the cb2 receptors which are found in your peripheral nervous system and they deal with you injure yourself or you if you have pain they will interact with either your own natural endocannabinoids that your body produces or cannabinoids from cannabis so the topical seem to work with responding to the cb2 receptors in your peripheral nervous system the THC doesn't act actually go into the blood I'm pretty sure I've done like a bunch of drug tests on yeah at least for now is that you're not going to fail a drug test you're going to feel psychoactive effects yeah and so people typically don't feel any sort of psychoactive effect it doesn't seem to get into your blood system it just seems to interact with these cb2 receptors so dealing with the issue right where you put the SAP or the topical on the skin and these cb2 receptors will help the healing response and will help bring your body back to homeostasis once they connect you know with the cannabinoids", "1haUZOgcpbw": "CBD pain relief cream there

tea leaf extracts to leave skin looking fresh plump and youthful shop now how to choose there's a whole lot of information to keep in mind when shopping for a CBD topical let's go over the basics potency the no.1 thing to look for is potency CBD doesn't pass through skin easily so it's important to use a potent product for best results potent products tend to contain at least 200 milligrams of CBD per container though some contain up to 1000 milligrams CBD source chances are you may have seen the terms isolate full spectrum and broad spectrum before these terms refer to the ways in which CB is extracted while isolates are ideal for consumers who want to be sure there's no THC in their product this extraction method strips away other cannabinoids and volatile organic compounds like terpenes reducing the overall therapeutic benefits of the CBD broad-spectrum products contain most cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant but don't contain THC full-spectrum products preserve all cannabinoids enter peens in the final product this is important because CBD and THC may work better together than they do alone thanks to the entourage effect note that any full-spectrum products made from hemp will still only contain 0.3% THC or less so it's still a relatively small amount quality control do you know where your hemp was grown reliable brands will often have this information readily available with some brands even going as far as to provide a certificate of analysis koa that'll allow you to view testing results with ease ideally you'll want to look for products made from US grown certified organic hemp since cannabis grown in the United States as subject to agricultural regulations be sure whatever you buy has been lab tested ideally by a third party and is pesticide and mold free be wary of products that don't provide this information either on their website or by emailing the company ingredients it's a good idea to opt for all natural organic ingredients whenever available you'll get all the benefits of the ingredients without the chemicals and pesticides price most CBD topicals fall in the $30 to $60 range pay close attention to products priced at over $100 you may decide they're worth it but do a little digging to be sure before you shell out the extra cash do they contain full spectrum CBD how potent are they do they contain other healing herbs or oils how to use topicals are meant to be massaged into the skin so you'll apply them directly to the affected area depending on other ingredients in the product you might feel tingling war or cooling sensations if you're using the product for pain you should start to feel effects relatively quickly if you're using it for a skin condition like acne or eczema you may have to apply it a few times to see results always refer to the packaging for specific directions and recommendations from the manufacturer precautions and side effects most topicals are safe to reapply as needed pay special attention to the type of carrier oil your product as made with since products based in coconut oil may melt when exposed to heat these products should be kept in a cool dark place be sure to read the packaging as most topicals are only meant for external use and many are not meant to be used on broken skin CBD as non-intoxicating meaning it won't get you high it's generally recognized as safe and there are a few side effects though they do occur occasionally possible side effects fatigue diarrhea changes in appetite changes in weight while CBD doesn't typically enter the bloodstream through topical application it's possible it may interact with some medications some research suggests that CBD may interact with liver enzymes and temporarily stop the liver from metabolizing other drugs or breaking down toxins always consult your doctor before using products with CBD even topicals", "njyYKHkokeE": "welcome to our video rendition of our product line brochure at CTF oh we offer

really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "b4tD1jFpTPo": "hello everybody and welcome back to kj steve i hope you guys are having yourselves a wonderful day enjoying ourselves all that wonderful magical good stuff and for today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know normally able to take and they are doing their magic they're great it's a nice body and head high and you know yeah it's what i would say if you've experienced edibles before you know saying your first edible you know what a good edible high is this is a very good one i would highly recommend yourself to get a metals if you can but yeah aside from that it's a great thing if you can try to get your hands on them you can try them out i don't know if they're all the same i'm gonna try to get my hands on some sour patch ones or some different ones but until then we'll see so yeah i would rate it you know 10 out of 10. if you guys get your hands on it you should try it so yeah that'll be if you guys have any other edibles again please put it down below i'll try to get my best i'll try my best to get my hands on it and

to bring you the latest in cannabis news selves verse topicals that is the question but what's the difference are they the same thing or how do they even work so those are just a few questions that we will be answering today so first and foremost you should know that cannabis topicals are a category of hemp product that allow you to avoid inhalation and ingestion they are used on the skin and are usually meant to soothe inflammation pain and skin conditions this category also includes cells now throughout history topicals have been known to treat itchy skin and traditional arabic remedies would even mix cannabis solution with skin and hair serums usually when other kinds of pop products are ingested there's a widespread effect throughout the body however when it comes to topicals the effect of cannabis it's localized to that exact area of application so for example when a topical is placed on your elbow the relief is felt just in the elbow and nowhere else another key difference between topicals and other pop products is that external application does not produce a mental high salv is an ointment and a subcategory of topicals now while other types of topicals like creams and lotions may go on a little thick selves have a more smooth feeling and so next time you have a sore muscles maybe from a tough workout joint pain firm arthritis or itchy skin from eczema rub some topical relief on the area and watch the amazing product go to work and that's the news you can use i'm susan with dink network sponsored by dance wonder Emporium a premier cannabis retailer in

really in the dark they were desperately seeking some answers well now Darcy Spirit shows us how they are seeing the lights all thanks to cannabis cream for Carter gray that is the sound of relief I just got an oil up ahead a massage from mom that means so much more we first met Carter a year ago he suffers from lamellar ichthyosis a rare skin disorder with no cure that causes dark scales where dead skin cells don't flake off despite corrective surgery Carter's skin is so tight he can't even shut his eyes he's forced to spend most of his time inside but his family is hoping this it's a miracle plan that's what it is just might change that it showed us from the first time that we used it thought it was worth continuing to use when we first brought you Carter's story his parents were dealing with industrial sized vats of coconut oil and making some progress but nothing like what's contained in these small jars creams made from cannabis oil an extract of marijuana how would you describe your reaction when you realized you'd found something that worked I cried oh haha a lot I still cry I still I'll be in the bathtub just scrubbing his back and the scales just fall right off into the bathtub Carter's grandma makes the creams in her kitchen giving her grandson a gift no doctor could completely clear like soft as a newborn take a look at these before and after photos of Carter's back and head no scarring no sign that there was ever even any buildup there at all a dermatologist told them there is nothing on the market that I could prescribe you that would give you better results than what you're getting so how does it work dr. Scott Jacobson says cannabis taps into the nature of our own bodies the endocannabinoid system is found throughout the body in the brain in the immune system in the nervous system as well as in the skin actually skin cells have cannabinoid receptors in them and so putting them on topically you're going to get that action directly where it's needed dr. Jacobson also says cannabis is known to reduce inflammation he's gonna do two for Carter and his family you get oh it's a giant leap forward relieved relieved and eager to find out more about what we can well we can do since our first report Carter story has gone international we have a lot more about his journey on ktnv calm Darcy Spears 13 Action News Carter wandering the district I'm", "ka1V0ztvt24": "[Music] hello goof-offs and jack-offs and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary although this time we are not going to be reviewing an edible we are instead going to be reviewing capsules delta-9 capsules to be exact 300 milligrams of THC 10 capsules in there with 30 milligrams each this will be the second time I have reviewed a capsule I reviewed I think it was gold caps the first time hated them a huge waste of money they were very expensive and they did nothing for me these are both cheaper and more potent I believe the other ones were 250 milligrams for 40 these were 300 milligrams for 30 so not a good sign necessarily but this is from Delta 9 this is why I decided to give capsules another chance Delta 9 is a company that I know from their chocolate I've reviewed three of their chocolate bars and have found them to be all amazing so I thought I would give their capsules a fair shake because I've never tried anything from gold capsule than there's one capsules and those were terrible so because this is from the trusty brand delta 9 or at least their chocolate is the trusty brand I thought let's give the capsules another chance who knows you might find some some gold here if not liquid gold so but I think I'm gonna do with these actually is I'm not going to eat them or take them all right off the bat I think I'm gonna do them in two batches 250 milligrams batches about 90 minutes apart so do all three of these over the course of the three hour span and come back to you guys two hours after the last time so this will take five hours in in totality to let you know how we're doing so I'm gonna take or four and a half hours I guess I don't know something like that so I'm going to do ten of these then come back to you guys in 90 minutes let you know how I'm feeling and then take the other ten and then come back to you guys two hours after that and lets you know how we're feeling with the whole batch so let's get started with this first half here let's open it up and just like you would expect this little bottle here oh and we've got our dastardly packaging which I opened nice and easy alright so here we go open open open here are what our capsules look like they're pretty handsome capsules white and green just like the packaging so let's grab five of these for now let's put the other five back in the model and let's take the five that we've got here and just uh I pressured that male life like I could choke okay [ __ ] it'd be funny did it choke thank you Ron Palmer love you alright well those pills tasted like plastic and amazing oh my god such rich complex flavors and those pills ooh still you know decoding all of the complex and just interesting tongue feel that I had with those pills of course I'm just [ __ ] with you who cares what they tasted like they tasted like pills I will see you guys in 90 minutes however to let you know how these first half of these pills are filling so I will see you guys in just a bit thanks for watching wheats and I will see you soon all right guys on back it has been about an hour and a half since I had the first five of the Delta nine capsules which is 150 milligrams of THC and I would say I'm already way higher than I was before when taking the gold caps 250 milligrams of THC definitely way higher than that but not outrageously high I'd say I'm at a four maybe a five somewhere in there so definitely feeling it which is a huge improvement but not you know this isn't like akarova 150 milligrams cookie um these excuse me these five pills um but we still have half the bottle to go so we'll see how much more these final five pills are how much farther they get us in the process all right so here we are we've got our final five these handsome little devils here we'll just do the same thing as before risk choking to death and take them all down in one go still alive that's got to be a sign of something so we've seen how it the first half go after about 90 minutes now let's see how the second half of the bottle goes and for that guys I will check back with you in about another 90 minutes and we will see if I am maybe at Delta nine instead of a delta for that kind of works all right guys I'll see you in about 90 minutes peace welcome back guys another 90 minutes has passed since I had the Delta nine capsules the remaining 150 milligrams and that seemed to do the trick put me from about a four to a straight linear about eight or so I'm quite high as you can tell from the eyes well no no no let's not say eight let's let's let's let's pump the brakes a little bit and go with a seven it's not let's not jump too far I think I'm maybe at about a seven but I'm pleasant with them I'm happy with where I'm at capsules I don't think are ultimately going to be for me these are a hell of a lot better I think than the gold caps the Delta nine capsules that's just on a sample size of one from both companies so you know take with that what you may but but my experience on these are a hell of a lot better than what I have with the gold caps and these were cheaper so that's a total win for Delta nine I don't think I'm gonna be purchasing them they're a little too expensive for me for what you get I do like the concept of them I do like the idea of capsules and just being able to like have something super super discreet that you don't even have to eat I just haven't found one yet that's as potent as I'd like them to be these are close these are close and if they were a little bit cheaper I would buy them on the regular for different occasions but as is I think I'm going to probably not be picking these up in the future but you know who knows maybe if they come out with different dosages or change the price or if I'm looking for something just to mix into a medicine bag or something maybe I'll maybe I'll still give these a chance and also let's give the wheats producer here round of applause for this back here oh my god isn't this amazing the wheats producer just which the they came in here the other day and they're like this place is a piece of [ __ ] we're whipping it into shape and I was terrified because if you ever met the wheats producer you would be you know mortified if something like that were to happen to you and look what happened you know a few days later we have this professional-looking thing in quotations thank you so much for watching wheat skies we will check you out on the next review Papa Papa peace great", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi

product we've got the Buddhist best 300 milligram triple chocolate brownie us this is the second Buddha's best product that I have reviewed I looked at the chocolate lover's ecstasy cookie before this also 300 milligrams really really liked it so I've got high hopes for this triple chocolate raspberry brownie let's take a look here standard packaging be sure to refrigerate it says again very nice of Buddhas best to incorporate a nutrition information and ingredients on the back not something you see in all of the edibles ingredients gold medal bread flour butter brown sugar egg cocoa raspberry preserves milk chocolate whole milk powder cocoa sugar vanilla extract and salt so all pretty normal ingredients in there and it looks like the entire brownie has about 360 calories in total not that bad what let's go ahead and open this bad boy up and give ourselves a taste all right nice and easy to open package again you never know with these edibles if that's gonna be the case or not sometimes you need some scissors handy alright so here is our brownie not the most appetizing looking brownie admittedly it's got some white chocolate chips I guess there maybe this is the raspberry preserves smells like you can smell the raspberry you can definitely smell the raspberry and no disturb or weed smell no marijuana smell whatsoever all right well let's go to taste what a politician what you could definitely definitely do the raspberry but not an overpowering way and there's a there's definitely a hint of raspberry in there the chocolates good I got some chocolate chips or the Makani or the white chocolate chips in there as well very tasty and I don't get any hint of marijuana whatsoever in the the taste so you don't like the taste of marijuana wow that's pretty good okay it's a rich brown he's a fudgy air brownie um take me some effort to eat this bad boy um but in the taste spectrum I like it but because I prefer the chocolate lover's ecstasy cookie to this but you're not gonna be disappointed with this brownie for sure no weed flavor and just generally a pretty good taste um oh also just like the chocolate livers and will keep very affordable this brownies 300 milligram edible only cost me $10 just on the low end but I'm sure you can find it for you around you know 12 to 15 bucks but yeah clip one very important duties bus well okay yeah I found this bad boy in a dispensary and Huntington Beach which is in Orange County California I think they're Buddha's best is pretty widely distributed at all um but as we know from all our earlier reviews the most important thing when it comes to an edible is not actually how it tastes it's how you feel afterwards and like miss my rubies I'll check back with you guys in half an hour and an hour and an hour or in two hours unless you know how we're feeling I'm gonna finish this bad boy off and I'll see you guys in half an hour hi guys so we are back here with our review of the Buddhist best triple chocolate raspberry brownie it has been 30 minutes since I have consumed this bad way except that crumb I just got right there um 30 minutes it feeling a little bit definitely feeling something and definitely feeling it increasing the feeling amplifying um finish off that brownie still really really enjoyed it oh not as good as I think the Korova cookies in terms of the taste I mean it's good it's very good but but in terms of value you're certainly gonna get your money's worth so well we'll check back in half an hour and see how this 300 milligrams of THC is is hitting us is hitting us in another thirty minutes we will check back then alright well it has been one hour since I consumed the Buddhist best 300 milligram triple chocolate raspberry brownie medical cannabis with hybrid cannabis product and things are going pretty well I you know going on cloud nine my guys okay sorry back on track Buddha's best in an hour after this 300 milligram edible I mean mostly the effects in my in my head right now not a lot in the body but the highest come on pretty strong and we're only an hour in so I'm expecting this to really ramp up to the next hour and we'll be sure to check with you guys back in at the two-hour mark as always well it's been two whole hours since I consumed that Buddha's best and Wow guys yeah it's the real deal I to be frankly honest I wish I had the whole thing not because it wasn't good it was great I just feel the whole [ __ ] day shot now man but if you know you actually want with the serving suggestion which is like not a whole one of these like maybe you know a sixth few one with the sixth of these of this that would be a wise investment buyer beware not because it isn't good but because it's too good no it's just right just a word of warning guys always follow the directions on the package never take a dose higher than what the package or the person who sold it to you recommends unless you know your tolerance unless you have an incredibly tolerant high tolerance or you've tried the animal before never try a higher dose than it recommends if you liked this video please feel free to subscribe and if there are a procs you would like me to try in the future please just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to review it on a future episode of wheats thanks for watching we'll catch you guys next time", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "yRRRaF_BKy8": "today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD based self by Christy wood from by the bay farms [Music] this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compound smells really really good she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not ena constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really important with any product like this we're really any cannabis product I'm going to move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat panic self massage it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the SAP itself I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life [Music] how's it going everybody its Freddie back here today and I'm bringing you a another product review and this time it is not from a dispensary and it is also not a flower or smokeable product so today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD base South by Christie wood from by the bay farms now Christy's located in Buzzards Bay and she was actually kind enough to reach out to me on Instagram and tell me about her products a little bit and she actually sent me some so this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compounds but I'm super interested in stuff like this because I have very little experience actually no experience with topicals so super exciting really something new for me and hopefully seeing as I get a lot of questions about CBD and the different uses for it this can help me and you both learn a little bit more about this really cool cannabinoid that is getting a lot of attention but people don't seem to have as much hands-on experience with as they'd like including me so firstly thank you thank you very much to Christy I really appreciate the generosity and you reaching out to me anybody who reaches out to me you kind of hold a special place in my heart because I put a lot of work into these videos into these reviews and it's a lot of passion as well and I don't mind doing it but whenever anybody shows appreciation that means a lot to me so you Christie and let's get into it so the South a basic basically the ingredients in here are organic coconut oil beeswax cannabis extracts in essential oils so this is a CBD only product as I mentioned before and the directions are essentially to Chris you suggest that you test a small bit of this SAP on your skin before applying it to a larger area just to make sure there's no reactions or interactions with your skin so essentially it's just like a bomb or something that you rub on your skin she recommends Christie does using a spoon to avoid cross-contamination or bacterial growth within the salad self and the recommendation on this page says that you cannot put too much on so there's no overdoing it with this I've used it a little bit the one thing I would say is it can be a little bit oily if you take too much at once so you might have a little bit of that coconut oily residue on your hands if you grab a little too much for a certain area but honestly what I do with it is if I have a little extra on my hands I know this sounds a little weird but I just like run it through my hair I really can you see this stuff being used for almost any use is kind of a skin facial topical sort of healing ointment type menthol icy hot almost type applicator or application would be a good use for this and I I believe that the coconut oils and stuff like that are really good for hair as well this is just a personal thing for me um I have kind of long hair I put products in it and if I have a little extra of this Salib on my hands just run it right through there some people might think that's weird too gross or greasy but I don't know I think it's natural smells really really good I have to say maybe the aroma the aroma therapy qualities of this stuff might be one of its strongest uses for me or the aroma therapy aromatherapy qualities if that's even a word are some of my favorite parts of the self so when I have it in my hands or on the spoon I just kind of inhale it or just hold up my hands and kind of breathe deeply and that just seems to be a really nice kind of calming effect for me that could be in my head but whatever works for you works for you right so I'm not here to judge and hopefully you aren't either so yeah this stuff is awesome I've been using it pretty much daily Christie recommends using it about 6 to 10 times a day for the first few weeks constant application seems to be the method to the madness with this stuff so getting a baseline of just like any medication really you know getting a baseline of it in your system or on your skin will help you get used to it and will help you reap the benefits from it a little bit faster and more holy so 6 - time 6 to 10 times a day apply it to whichever areas you feel you need it the most and after that you can start to decrease the dosage that you put on according to Christie so she mentions specifically at the end of this little blurb she's written me that she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not enough so if you want to purchase this stuff from Christie or you're thinking about checking it out be wary you're not going to you know put it on one time like some snake oil and immediately be cured of all your ailments it's not how any medicine really works so constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really is really important with any product like this notice how you feel before during and after an experience with something like this or really any cannabis product because that's how you really can you know see the effects because they're not always immediate they're not always super extravagant at first but when you implement cannabis and cannabis infused products into your life daily the little steps it makes over a long period of time make a huge difference so that's what I try to tell people is you know don't expect a one-time care because those don't exist in life but kind of weaving these natural and organic and well done products into your lifestyle will really just make your quality of life so much better in my opinion okay so now I'm gonna give you guys a little breakdown of how I apply this stuff and yeah we'll go from there so I'm going to actually turn and move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat oh okay so as you can see summer has not yet hit in Massachusetts I am pale as a ghost but I like to put this stuff on my shoulders I get a lot of tension in my neck and in my upper shoulders so I find that an early morning application of this South especially after sleeping on my neck weird if by the way if you don't notice if you haven't noticed by now I have a [ __ ] long neck so this thing's always hurting me actually I had to put an extra little book on my tripod because my neck was too long for the Headroom anyway I digress so what I do per the instructions I open this up if that is really cool-looking I'll actually bring it over to you you can see it so you can see the way my fingertips are ready it's smells reminiscent of a mix vapor rub kind of which is one of my all-time favorite scents mixed with cannabis it's got a really strong cannabis smell but it's not overwhelming it's not skunky it's kind of a sweet natural organic smell of cannabis if that makes sense it's so so so medicinal just as an aroma therapy medicine for me I could literally sit here and sniff this stuff all day and it's just calmed me right down I think that's kind of the essential oils that are in here I'm sure that those have a lot to do with it alright so basically what I do is I get a little bit on the spoon and now I don't want it to be too much I don't know if you can see very well here but I don't have a lot have a little bit and then I just put that in my hands and so one thing that Christie talks about in here which i think is really wise and smart is the fact that a lot of times pain or inflammation or symptoms you're experiencing might be localized in one spot that not that may not be the cause of the of the ailment itself or the root cause so you might be feeling pain in one place as you see him rubbing this together you might be feeling pain in one place but the cause might be in another spot next to it so make sure you apply this in a large swath of skin or area because you don't just want to focus on the one localized acute pain point you kind of want to get all around it to loosen everything up so hands super oily right now it's all this stuff so what I like to do is just rub it on my neck and shoulders so right on my upper back kinda massaging it in this would make a really good massage oil too and that's not a necessarily written use for it on here but I'm sure it would be perfect for that so if you are a masseuse you like to give yourself self massage or if you've got a significant other you bless this out give them a little back and booty rub you're gonna have a healthy happy relationship oh man yeah so I just rub it all in and then with the excess I just gotta you know throw it in the hair I got a headband in now so probably to mess it up a little bit but I know that might might be gross to some people you might think it's greasy and weird but I don't care so immediately upon applying this stuff I'll tell you I also put my shirt back on immediately upon applying this stuff I feel a menthol like quality and the CBD seems to take effect and root in right after this menthol like feeling kind of wears off so it's immediately it's not an icy hot it's not intense like you know hot to relax it away or cold anything it's more so just a very not a numbing feeling but a slight kind of anesthetic numbing agent feeling it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to and this could be you know placebo effect but it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the south-- itself so take that for what it's worth that's a personal anecdote of mine I have a nose pick evidence to back that but yeah you put the stuff on you take a take a bowl or a nice bong rip it might have increased efficacy for you and that's something I believe in so definitely something to keep in mind if you do plan on getting some of this South which I do highly recommend like I said overall as a lifestyle choice I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life because we use a lot of oils rubs creams and stuff but to be able to have access to something that's derived from cannabis and has those essential oils and common pounds in them is really cool and nice and I can't thank Christie enough once again I'll say it again Christie would by the bay farm her phone number five zero eight six eight five oh seven seven nine and you can also see her website on cannabis pain SOUTHCOM that is cannabis pain South one word.com south is sa l ve alright so that's about all I have for you today I feel great my muscles are definitely more relaxed after all of this and since I've implemented this as a daily kind of regimen I honestly do feel less or less tight in the morning and overall great experience so I can't recommend it enough Thank You Christy and thank you for watching I really appreciate it have a good one guys you", "d3pNjEWEak4": "hi guys okay so today I am doing a video on my top 5 CBD creams I've been loving the CBD oil but I am training for a 10k which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts my knees so I'm was looking for a solution that I could apply on the you know pain area directly and so CBD cream seemed to fit the bill and actually it worked really well and I'm really glad I tried it so I want to share with you my top 5 today so if after this review you want to try CBD creams as well just click on the link in the video description for the best CBD deals alright so in fifth place I put met Tara's CBD rapid cooling cream these guys are for the cream in two strengths we've got the 250 milligram at $44.99 and the 750 milligrams at 70 799 their cream is a blend of CBD menthol and arnica and that's what provides that rapid cooling effect and really helps with joint and muscle discomfort I just rub it on my knees right after a run and it provides instant relief and usually it lasts for a couple hours and then after that the pain is gone for the day also with this one the menthol smell isn't too strong so you can just apply it after a shower in the morning and head off to work no problem and as with all other matera products these guys are 100% natural and organic they don't contain any THC they are made in the US and they provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in 4th place we have nano crafts cooling sports cream this one is $59.99 for 500 milligram which is great if you need an in-between dosage from Matara this one has a pump dispenser like the matera one so that makes it really easy to dose and apply the cream this one is also made in the US with non-gmo all organic ingredients meaning that it doesn't contain any pesticides herbicides or chemical fertilisers etc and they also provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in third place we have another product from nano crafts it's the muscle and joint bundle so this one is great if you're already convinced and want to take it one step further so this bundle includes the broad spectrum CBD soft gel capsules with curcumin these are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD which is perfect for daily and consistent consumption to make sure that you have a smooth start to your day they also have the broad-spectrum pure CBD drops which are also packed with 25 milligrams of CBD another way to consume CBD if you're out of capsules you can just take a few drops as is there ginger sytrus flavored or you can simply add to a protein shake or a post-workout snack and the third product is the broad spectrum muscle and joint stick that's loaded with 500 milligrams a full spectrum hemp oil that's great for on-the-go application if you're feeling some discomfort you know as you're working out outside and that's usually two hundred and fifty dollars but they're selling it for 195 but again if you want the best prices click the link in the video description it gets updated regularly with the best deals alright moving on to number two which is the ultra relief gel from just CBD just CBD is one of my favorite CBD brands they have a ton of product variety to choose from so the ultra relief gel comes at $59.99 for a thousand milligrams of CBD this one is great if you're looking for big CBD dosage at an affordable price the smell is not overpowering the pump makes it really easy to use and you can really feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in this video if you've got any aches and pains or just if you have if you often have pain after an intense workout or just starting to feel the effects of age then I really recommend you to try CBD creams and let me know how it goes in the comments all right if you want the best deals for these CBD creams just

"KGWNCeuuYnw": "I have had chronic pain for the last ten plus years and I've tried pretty much everything that Western medicine has to offer the main cause of my pain is enemy tree osis basically my vagina in abdomen area lower back all of that good stuff hurt all the time but to be honest no surgery amount of yoga prescription pill anything that I've tried has helped me as much as CBD has all the products that I'm going to show you today are very high in CBD and have low to no THC so that I can go about my day without being stoned out of my gourd these are the products that I use every day the first one are these premium gel caps it's just 25 milligrams of CBD they helped me so much with getting an appetite because one of my biggest symptoms with endometriosis is constantly feeling sick to my stomach nauseous never wanting to eat next up I have this paper pen from select CBD the reason I really like select is because they have peppermint flavor that for me helps me a lot like I said I'm nauseous a lot so getting this like quick ingestion with a little peppermint flare where I don't have to have the oil in my mouth is like all I can ask for this is called mad ritual it's just a little balm that I use specifically on my abdomen and lower back it doesn't feel as heavy as other bombs and some lotions that I've tried either like and you don't need to use very much of it which is great because some of these bombs can be pretty pricey these are called basic suppositories so it's a CBD suppository if you don't know what a suppository is it's like this little thing of CBD that I put directly into my vagina so it goes right to the problem area during my period or when I'm having a particularly bad in Demetrios this flare this is kind of specific to endometriosis but I had to include them because half the population has periods this is a lotion that I loved from sagely it's just it's called relief in recovery which is why I started trying it because anything that says relief I really like what I love about sagely products is that they smell very natural and they have pretty good ingredients in them and they also go on non greasy very white and they smell nice so it's kind of like you're just putting on like your daily lotion but you're getting pain relief or benefits from it this is another good option for anti-inflammatory lotion this is a really great option for just a day to day especially if you're like me and you're like typing or on your phone all the time I use this a lot on my wrist to kind of help relieve this is just a simple basic CBD tincture I don't really like tinctures because I don't like putting oil directly into my mouth I'm just it's a weird texture thing for me so this one I mix with a drink and do it that way this has taken me a couple of years to figure out what works for me and unfortunately with CBD it is a lot of trial and error but for me all of that trial and error has been a hundred percent worth it because now I use it every day I really look forward to the day when CBD is as commonly used as aspirin because I I truly believe in it and I truly believe in its effects and I think it could help a lot of people", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in.

Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking

from Hamilton people and we owe", "M-QREv9LFV8": "[Music] hi friends welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are taking our second look at a gummy a gummy manufacture that I quite liked the first time I reviewed and that is tiki killer's tiki killer's this was a real surprise for me the first time I reviewed it is a 300 milligram edible this time it's peach flavor we reviewed the green apple the first time it surprised me in many ways one gummies rarely get me high just I find them to be usually less potent than this sort of confectionaries but this one got me nice and high too for its price normally things you know in the edible world you get what you pay for a 300 milligram edible for 15 bucks especially in this sort of not so nice packaging it's just sort of a ziploc bag with some kind of stickers on the front and back you know it's not the nicest packaging and usually that's a sign of you know a bad omen but in the first case it worked out well so I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke and I just didn't get a great batch or something so I decided to go ahead and pick up another one and give it a review as well to see if you know they are another gummy brand worth investing in so let's go ahead and open up the tiki killers peach 300 milligram here and give it a taste and if this is your first time tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work real simple I'm gonna eat this product here and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours for you it'll be just a couple of seconds I'll just edit right together and you'll see exactly just exactly how high this product got me because that's the most important part of the edible review right is finding out exactly how high you're gonna get you know is it gonna work for you or is it gonna just be a waste of money that's what we're here for it we so I do like the sculpt of these gummies there are these cool little like Tiki shaped things here boo boo boo boo like I'm covered in some granulated sugar as well the taste in the green apple is great let's give a the peachy go well that has a very peachy flavor actually there must be some real peach in there actually I mean there's just like cannabis taste to it but compared to a lot of other gummies I mean this is this is amber ogia this is good stuff again there's a slight slight cannabis taste so if you can't stand any taste a weed you know maybe give it a skip but for gummies this is great there are four of them in the package this is 75 milligrams each I'm gonna finish these guys off if you watch too and then I will see you in two hours thanks for watching witch guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace Oh quick addendum I should mention I had fat before before I consume these just a little bit before I had these so I did have some fat already so I didn't forget to take fat I just didn't take any additional fat during the video but I did have some right before this so so rest assured consistency in our experiments is key here at wheats thanks for watching sorry about the the late-breaking news talk to you soon [Music] just ate some spicy food that's why I got them all I'm all sweaty here just well probably not spicy for any of you listening but spicy for me I'm a real real [ __ ] when it comes to the spicy stuff I like it I just just can't really handle it handle it but what I can handle although I am handling it not as easily as I would have thought is the Tiki Killers that's two for two for the Tiki Killers I am quite high I would say I'm at a six so I again this is a $15.00 edible for a 300 milligram err I got a discount I believe I got it for 13 bucks so a pretty good value most gummies like comparatively the 200 milligram cuz she punch is twenty dollars I don't know I mean like I'm not gonna suggest that this 300 milligrams is equivalent to their 200 milligrams or anything like that but I dunno if you like gummies it's a pretty good value it got me quite high it's quite tasty it's got shitty packaging and I just now noticing you can kind of see there if it doesn't shimmer too much some like oily residue left in that package which is probably just the way that the the way they get the tea and it's probably just cannabis oil of some kind leftover but I I really like Tiki Killers it's good stuff still probably wouldn't be my first choice for gummy edibles I think I would still reach for flourish first but if I saw these in my dispensary and wasn't looking for some kind of confectionery was looking for something a little bit easy you know quicker to eat less calories and they had Tiki killers there I grabbed them I've give him a shot um they're definitely two for two and they seem to be pretty reliable so guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats if you enjoyed this review please do me a favor give me one of those little thumb yuppies subscribeee also you can even follow me on twitter a tweets reviews or give me a like on the facebook at wheats reviews on facebook as well i would super appreciate it thank you so much for watching guys we will check you out a later review peace", "ZL_j5dyk1Q8": "and to share with you the value of incorporating topicals into your medicine cabinet we feel that cannabis topicals and saves are generally underutilized they can be really effective for pain inflammation and skin conditions and the great thing is they're not psychoactive now personally I've used topicals a lot for sunspots and small skin cancers and I've had excellent outcomes there is plenty of documentation of people who've used them effectively for arthritis for joint pain and others use them for skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis sometimes you're going to find that topicals are blended with other herbs oils or products that can really help amplify their effect for a specific purpose here are some things to know about topical use a game psychoactivity is not an issue as the cannabinoids don't enter the bloodstream now they're not magical creams that aren't always work wonders upon initial use consistency is the key so I recommend using them multiple times a day and see if they work for you now it's also best to apply topicals at times of the day when you're not moving around a lot or sweating before bed is a great time and throughout the day when perhaps you're at your desk or just not running around let's look at a few simple topical products now there's really no surprises here what you would expect from any cream or therapeutic topical it's really not a huge difference with cannabis okay now with topicals it's hard to tell exactly how much of specific ingredient is in the topical itself obviously a cannabis topical will contain some cannabis or a lot of cannabis the labels should tell you if there's any other herbs or additives within the topical itself a lot of the time they'll use an oil as a base obviously some producers do choose to combine cannabis with other herbs or plants within a topical er south now we know that a lot of plants are good for medical use and depending on the specific intent of a product they could choose to combine it with an array of different plants whether it's for nerve pain inflammation or an array of other specific uses so just pay attention to the labels and start to educate yourself about both what cannabis is good for for you as well as potentially other herbs is also now let's get acquainted with this topical here notice first of all that they put it in a dark container this helps protect it from the Sun and one thing that I like to do it being acquainted with any product really but especially a Savoie topical is to first just simply smell it our smell is a really powerful sense that we have and it can help inform us about what our body likes about what it about what it doesn't like for example and cannabis actually I can smell it it has a distinct smell okay so you can sometimes even tell how concentrated this topical is with cannabis or smell other products within it now when applying can start liberally but the great thing about topicals is that really there's no psychoactivity you can't overdose you can't really overdo it but I like to start still with topicals start low and kind of go slow up in terms of the application just to gauge how effective they are so I have a chronic injury in my wrist from some impact from a martial art so I'm just gonna rub it on I like to rub it on my joints particularly but you can use it for any array of uses sometimes it can be very effective verts in conditions like psoriasis and eczema and dry skin that's really great inflammation like in my case or pain pain in joints or other areas some people use it like my colleague Chris for cancer for skin cancer and it can actually help with that topical application as well so I'm just rubbing it in smoothly if it's really thick you can combine it with another oil that's fine as well any other lipid-based product you can just combine it with whether you like the smell of it or anything so feel free to experiment and combine it with some other products you may use therapeutically and topically okay do as much research as you can we recommend this with any product that you take but it's really harder to go wrong with topicals and they are very safe so enjoy it enjoy your senses and just see how it affective is for your symptoms and condition", "FD4joFW13co": "[Music] what's good bass-drum militia I'm bass drop keys your friendly neighborhood Negro and today we're gonna talk about how to calculate edible dosage now recently I started a cooking with cannabis show called good eats on my channel where we make different meals infused with cannabis because of this I've been getting a lot of questions on how to calculate edible dosage so let's go ahead and get into this okay so in order to calculate your dosage you will need two bits of information you need to know the THC percentage of your cannabis and also you need to know how many grams of cannabis you'll be using to make your edibles for this tutorial let's pretend like we're going to make 2 cups of butter or four sticks I actually have some gorilla glue right now that's been tested at 17% THC so that's what we're going to use now normally when I make Kenna butter I use a quarter of flour per stick so for this tutorial we'll be using 28 grams or accounts of cannabis to make four sticks of butter like I normally do the first thing that you need to know is that there is a thousand milligrams in one gram of cannabis so the first thing that we need to do is we need to take our 28 grams that we'll be using and turn it into milligrams to do that we're going to take the 28 grams so we're going to multiply it by a thousand which is 28,000 the next thing we need to do is to multiply that by the amount of THC that's in our cannabis in decimal form so that means that our 17 percent THC cannabis is going to turn into 0.17 twenty-eight thousand times point one seven equals four thousand seven hundred and sixty so there's four thousand seven hundred and sixty milligrams of THC and this batch of butter that we're making right now but remember this is actually one of the four sticks of butter because we're doing two cups that means that we need to divide it by four that means that each stick of butter is actually one thousand one hundred and ninety milligrams of THC but let's go further let's say that we're going to make brownies and your brownie recipe calls for half a stick of butter that means there will be five hundred milligrams of THC inside of your brownie mix now if we take our recipe and make 10 brownies with our brownie mix that means each brownie will have fifty nine point five milligrams of THC inside each individual brother so that's it that's how you calculate edible dosage you have to find out how many milligrams of THC is actually in the whole batch and then break it down into how many portions you'll be making so I hope that this video helped you out if you have any questions please leave them in the comment section also let me know if you like this new style of videos that I'm doing I appreciate you watching much love as always peace [Music]", "pf7uWK-slHQ": "[Music] hi it's Madame ruffle studios and welcome to cannabase ik's today we're making a cannabis infused pain relief topical this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop save 10% on vaporizers raw rowing papers and accessories and much more with the code canna basics a truffle studios.com let's get started here's what you're gonna need you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol we're putting is about 1215 milliliters you also need some fresh cannabis flowers we're using about 50 grams of fresh harvested flowers you need some fresh to ruffle hours commonly called hells bells about to medium flowers [Music] you also need some rue de also known as common room it's an aromatic herbal plant you need about 15 grams of that and you're also going to need some camphor tablets you need six quarter ounce squares or one and a half blocks camphor tablets are available at pharmacies and also online if you'd like to learn where to get these ingredients and to see the full written recipe please check out our blog site for free on the link in description or here on the screen it'll also be helpful if you have a mortar and pestle and also have large mason jar with a lid now the first step is going to be to manicure and to chop your fresh cannabis I like to destem the buds and use the fresh soft flower portion of the buds and the smaller leaves some pain relief strains that would be excellent for this is Charlotte's Web and Harlequin among many others [Music] using a chef's knife to chop the cannabis makes it very easy to chop the marijuana into very small bits you want to stop short of chopping the cannabis into a pace so it's still easy to collect it from the cutting board and once you have a choppa scoop it all up and put it into the large sealable jar I find that a 64-ounce wide mouth mason jar is perfect for the amount of cannabis that we're using in this recipe today next we would do the same thing that we did with the cannabis to the Rue de plana rue de otherwise known as common rule or herb of grace is an ornamental plant and herb which is recommended by the person who provided this classic home remedy recipe it's used as an arthritis pain reliever much like the cannabis remove the large stems if you want and then chop the root of fine once you have it chopped we're going to put it into the jar with the rest of the canvas next up we need to mash our doctoral or hels belles flour into a paste but first gently press out any of the water that may be collecting with a paper towel a datura is a poisonous plant so do not ingest this or get it into your eyes however the FDA has recognized the medicinal uses of the torah' recently because of the presence of certain chemical compounds now find it's helpful to use a mortar and pestle in doing this but you could also use the back of a spoon into a shallow pan or a plate however you achieve it you need to mash the to medium size flowers into a paste then add about 250 milliliters of alcohol to wash the mortar and pestle and to make sure that he rats all of the datura paste into the jar along with the rinsing alcohol [Music] now add the remaining amount of alcohol needed to fill the jar to about twelve hundred and fifty milliliters now we need to chop or crumble four cubes of camphor blocks until almost powdered then carefully scoop it up and add it into the alcohol mixture into the jar now add the two remaining kaffir tablets into the mixture hold without crumbling them up these two whole ones will help us make an aggregate when we shake and will also help release the cap for a little more slowly as it dissolves into the plant extracts now make sure that you put the lid on the jar and tighten it very securely because now we need to shake vigorously for several minutes now the better you shake the better and faster this process will complete in the long run so stay with it as long as you can the mixture will begin to take on a greenish tint but we still have a while to go because now we let it sit for several days in a cool dark place and shaking it again periodically after several days five to seven days at least the mixture will darken and the green color will saturate into a neon green color after several days the topical is ready to use but you can continue with these optional steps to make it more refined and easy to use product so now you can strain it very carefully through an unbleached coffee filter to remove any of the plant materials this will make it easier if you follow the next step now the product is ready to funnel into a spray or roll-on container so that when you need it you can easily roll or spray it onto the affected areas this top pool can be used as needed on the skin do not ingest it because it will make you very sick also keep it well away from your eyes and children but it is a great for arthritis pain general aches and pains and in muscles and joints and other general topical useless and to answer this inevitable question in advance

efficacy of high CBD low THC for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana treatment programs at the end of this presentation there is a YouTube video for you to watch on CBD THC just click on the far left of your screen today's learning objectives are understanding CBD THC ratios in medical marijuana and using high CBD low THC cannabis products to treat disease processes there are at least a hundred and thirteen cannabinoids and this webinar is going to address two of them that work together to provide our bodies with synergy that's high CBD low THC strains of marijuana and how they help patients who use them CBD and THC interact with each other and by using them together patients may find that the effects of THC are lessened but prolonged there are many patients who just cannot tolerate the effects of THC while there are many others who smoke THC in order to relax another factor to consider is the way in which marijuana is consumed such as smoking tinctures edibles and topicals cannabinoids are better absorbed by the body when ingested on a full stomach CBD is intrinsically safe and there is no way to tell if you have had enough as with THC you would just be too high combining CBD and THC causes a reduction in the psychoactive effects of THC CBD will also help to lessen the sedative and appetite appetite inducing effects this is known as the entourage effect where both compounds work best when they're used together these two molecules are a perfect complement to each other in January of this year the medical value of cannabis was recognized by the world who health organization the therapeutic potentials of cannabis and cannabinoids has been acknowledged for the first time since 1954 by this group they have proposed new international scheduling moving towards efforts to increase the potential for countries to provide legal safe access for medical use of cannabis and its research the organization accepted the public's comments on the scheduling of marijuana until March 14th of this year I of course posted my thoughts on the website and implored them to seriously consider removing marijuana as a schedule 1 drug cannabidiol or CBD is a component of the anibus plant that may have enormous therapeutic potential although it doesn't make people feel high like THC CBD is causing quite a buzz among scientists health professionals and medical marijuana patients who are using CBD products to treat a wide variety of conditions including chronic pain cancer Crohn's diabetes rheumatoid arthritis PTSD cardiovascular disease anxiety and antibiotic resistant infections multiple sclerosis schizophrenia and more academic research centers around the world are currently studying effects of CBD on these and other ailments scientists refer to CBD as a promiscuous compound because it confers therapeutic benefits in many different ways while tapping into how we function physiologically and biologically on a deep level extensive preclinical research and some clinical studies have shown that CBD have strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant antidepressant antipsychotic antitumoral and neuro protective qualities cannabidiol appears to change gene expression and may be helpful in removing beta amyloid plaque which is the hallmark of Alzheimer's from brain cells what is THC CBD and THC are the power couple of cannabis therapeutics they appear to work best together for example CBD is believed to boost th C's pain-killing and anti-cancer properties CBD can also lessen the side effects of too much THC including anxiety and rapid heartbeat relaxing but not intoxicating is how some people describe CBD rich cannabis products CBD and THC both appear to stimulate neurogenesis the creation of new brain cells and adult mammals which may prove helpful for stroke and Parkinson's patients products made from industrial hemp that contain little or no THC are currently being market widely but recent scientific studies suggest that the products made from hemp or synthetic CBD maybe less effective therapeutically than cannabis based medicines because they lack critically secondary cannabinoids and other medicinal compounds that interact with CBD and THC to enhance their therapeutic benefits scientists call this the entourage effect numerous cannabis compounds have medicinal attributes but the therapeutic impact of the whole plant cannabis seems to be greater than the sum of its parts it still seems that patients are looking for the most part the high THC low CBD products but I feel as a nurse that they would be better suited to choose the high CBD low THC products for medicinal purposes it just seems like the high CBD has more benefits for most medical patients CBD binds with CBD receptors in the body and helps to regulate appetite pain management and immune system function such as inflammation Harlequin sweet and sour widow Stephen Hawking Kush ac/dc canna tonic and Pennywise are some of the most popular and common strains of high CBD flour it is not so much that CBD makes you feel good but that it makes you not feel bad and since it's a cap cannabinoid coming from the cannabis plant it is often confused with THC which is a psychoactive compound and people expect to feel high from it it's imperative that we educate patients as well as the public to the fact that being high as they say on cannabis cannot be compared to being intoxicated on alcohol or to the ill effects of most pharmaceuticals such as opiates benzodiazepines antipsychotics and antidepressants with a CBD high you won't feel sedated or groggy for most people it takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of CBD when taken on an empty stomach if taking on a full stomach it's about an hour there are many studies that find inflammation as the main contributing factor in problems of the brain such as anxiety brain fog depression autism a DD and ADHD CBD oil is proving to be an effective treatment for social anxiety and is naturally calming side effects from cannabis are dose dependent high CBD low THC therapy should always start with low doses increasing slowly so that the patient can find their individual dose and unwanted effects can be avoided CBD also interacts with THC by taking CBD and THC together individuals may find that the effects of THC are tempered but prolonged slightly some people can hardly tolerate any THC the wide range of reaction to THC rich cannabis may be influenced by genetic factors that may be one of the reasons why some people find THC rich cannabis to be unpleasant while hundreds of millions smoked it to relax this genetic variant exists among 20% of people in the European and Middle Eastern population of Caucasians meaning one in five or THC averse less than 10 percent of Africans have this genetic variant and among Asians it's less than 5% how does CBD benefit the human body CBD shows promise for helping to subdue the symptoms of anxiety which most of us about 30% suffer from it produces effects via molecular molecular pathways CBD enhances activation of serotonin to impede disorders such as anxiety it has been found to be a natural anxiety calmer and works very well in the treatment of social anxiety in addition to fighting inflammation in the body CBD oil may reduce anxiety by directly affecting the brain studies have found that CBD actually lowers activity in the amygdala and increases prefrontal cortex activation to parts of the brain involved in anxiety is also evidence that CBD is able to activate new neurons in the hippocampus this accent activates CBD 1 receptors which has a positive balancing impact on gaba and glutamate levels associated with reducing anxiety doctors often advise people with chronic anxiety to avoid cannabis as THC can trigger or amplify feelings of anxiousness and paranoia which is true I think for a lot of people that paranoia is definitely a side effect of a high THC product however authors of a review from neuro therapeutics found that CBD may help to reduce anxiety in people with certain related disorders according to the review CBD may reduce anxiety related behaviors and people with conditions such as PTSD general anxiety disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder the authors noted that current treatments for these disorders can lead to additional symptoms and side effects which can cause some people to stop taking them no further definitive evidence currently leaked CBD to adverse effects and the authors called for further studies of the compound as a treatment for anxiety anxiety and depression or pathologies affect human beings and may aspects of life including social life productivity and health CBD is a compound of the cannabis plant with great psychiatric potential including use as an antidepressant studies involving animal models performing a variety of experiments on the above-mentioned disorder such as the forced swimming test the elevated plus maze and the global conflict test suggest the CBD exhibited an anti-anxiety and antidepressant effect in the animal models discussed experiments with CBD demonstrated non activation of neuroreceptor cb1 and cb2 PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological ailment that is beginning to gain the attention of CBD research PTSD exhibits and individuals who have experienced trauma and/or abuse in their lifetime the disorder is most noteworthy and military veterans and accident survivors CBD has proven beneficial in relation to PTSD as it reportedly helps curb manifestations of both depression and anxiety without the debilitating side effects of pharmaceuticals CBDs effectiveness concerning PTSD is evident in the fact that states like Arizona are now recognizing PTSD as an ailment that warrants legal access to medical marijuana CBD has the ability to lower cortisol levels at slow down muscle growth the reason body builders need to work regularly to maintain continued growing their form is because our bodies do not grow muscles naturally in fact our endocrine system produces catabolic hormones such as cortisol which break down muscle mass in order to use the amino acids for other functions to counter this dilemma someone who wishes to build muscle would have to take catabolic supplements and this is where CBD comes into play studies show that cannabidiol can lower the number of catabolic hormones in the human body meaning that muscle game won't be lost so quickly and it makes it easier to gain muscle mass quicker keep in mind that CBD should not be taken with caffeine at least not for this purpose caffeine promotes the production of catabolic hormone so it would only counter the effects of CBD many medical patients tell us that marijuana helps their pain neuropathic pain also known as nerve pain is a unique type of pain that is caused by injured dysfunction or irritated nerves the pain tends to be chronic and severe with no known cure or remedy the individual is left to try numerous strategies to try to find something that works some of the most common sources of neuropathy include diabetes injury cancer infections alcoholism and autoimmune disorders have been human clinical trials that support benefits of THC and CBD for nerve pain there have been fewer studies examining just CBD in an animal study researchers found that oral supplementation of CBD led to improvements in neuropathic pain in rats back pain is one of the most common forms of both acute and chronic pain acute back pain tends to call be caused by an injury such as a fall or by lifting something heavy chronic back pain is that which lasts more than three months and is often caused by a ruptured or bulging disc author itis osteoporosis scoliosis or nerve pain some back pain is partly caused by inflammation and numerous preclinical animal studies have found benefits of CBD for inflammation three possible reduction in both nerve and inflammatory pain CBD may help relieve back pain the main mechanism by which CBD is thought to help mediate pain is by reducing inflammation largely by blocking inflammatory mediators it is also believed to potentiate glycan receptors which help to regulate pain at the spinal level this suppresses both neuropathic and inflammatory pain CBD has been found to exhibit enhancements in treating pain both when used on its own and when used in combination with THC when used alone CBD is largely best for inflammatory pain such as that caused by arthritis or injuries in one animal study on arthritis pain it was found that the topical application of CVD led to a reduction in inflammation and pain another animal study found that CBD helps to reduce neuropathic pain through the suppression of chronic inflammation CBD does not directly bind to the receptors found in the endocannabinoid system so rather works to modulate the effects of endocannabinoids found naturally in our bodies as well as working as a cb-one antagonist when searching for the best cannabis strains for pain relief you will first want to consider how much THC and CBD is found in the stream generally you will find most relief from a string that has large quantities of both CBD and THC with a high CBD THC ratio this is because CBD can help to mediate the side effects of THC while also providing additional anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer authors of a review published in the British Journal of clinical pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer the researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction they pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity and they called for further research in its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments type 1 diabetes results from inflammation that occurs when the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas research published in 2016 found that CBD may ease this inflammation in the pancreas this may be the first step in finding a CBD based treatment for type 1 diabetes a paper presented the same year in Lisbon Portugal suggests that CBD may reduce inflammation and protect against the delay or development of type 1 diabetes initial research published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease found CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficit in its participants this means that CBD could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's keep the ability to recognize the faces of the people that they know this is the first evidence that CBD may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease across the board it would appear as though CBD is a natural wakefulness promoting compound because of this it seems smart to recommend to take your CBD supplement or full-spectrum hep extract supplement in the morning so as to keep you alert all day and not to interfere with falling asleep interesting enough when subjects do this it appears that not only do they stay alert and awake throughout the day but they also fall asleep at night more quickly without any additional sleep aid and stay asleep longer this would appear to be because CBD is known to modulate the microglia activation of the inflammatory cycle keeping your body in a less inflamed state and lowering your stress in a review of studies done on chronic pain patients the reviewer found adequate evidence to correlate CBD oil consumption with improving multiple sleep biomarkers including sleep onset which is basically how quickly someone falls asleep the study also saw repeating incidents of lower dream recall and CBD subjects which is very interesting it's difficult to point to a mechanism here since very little is known about the nature of dreams in the field of neuroscience however this does point to the idea that dream recall may be regulated by the endocannabinoid system to some degree the same study also saw a decrease in insomnia symptoms among subjects it appears as though CBD is positively correlated with improving sleep patterns but funny enough not actually by making you sleepy as it is a wakefulness promoting agent and not a sedative like THC in fact it appears to promote sleep improvement due to the fact that it can lower stress levels as a powerful antioxidant where it benefits controlling free radicals in induced inflammation are well-documented this is great news as you can consume your CBD supplements in the morning to keep you stress-free and relaxed but focused throughout the day and then you may fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep longer throughout the night using high CB low THC to help quitting smoking some promising evidence suggests that CBD may help people quit smoking cigarettes a pilot study published in addictive behaviors found that smokers who used inhalers containing CBD smoked fewer cigarettes than usual and had no further cravings for nicotine a similar review published in neuro therapeutics found that CBD may be a promising treatment for people with opioid addiction disorders the researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders these included anxiety related symptoms pain and insomnia more research is necessary but these findings suggest that CBD may help to prevent or even reduce withdrawal symptoms children with autism spectrum disorder seek significant improvement in symptoms and less reliance on other medications after treatment with tecum ohlins ever deagle medical cannabis as confirmed by a new study published in scientific reports the two-year study followed 188 children with an average age of 13 diagnosed with ASD the patients were treated with tecum \u00f6hlins high CBD low THC medical cannabis strains which have been specifically cultivated and shown to provide symptom relief for ASD and related conditions with minimal psychoactive effect at the study's outset the most common patient symptoms were restlessness rage attacks and agitation after six months of daily cannabis treatment with at tecum olan's clinics in israel 80 point 1 percent of the patients reported improvement of their symptoms with only with 30 point one percent reporting significant improvements other key findings included of the 27 patients who had epilepsy 24 reported improved or disappearance of symptoms 34 point four percent of patients decreased other medications and 20 percent of patients stop using anti-psychotic medication autism is a leading condition of concern worldwide so this study couldn't have come at a better time says dr. Annabelle manola PhD who is tecum olam scientific director this data showed that autism patients can improve their overall quality of life utilizing a high CBD low THC strain and most importantly that young users can safely and effectively benefit from medical cannabis with the study cannabis is shown to be an effective choice for parents looking for the safest and most neuroprotective treatment the side-effects to cannabis treatment were minimal the FDA recently approved epidemics as a medication for children with refractory Caeser disorders and the DEA classified at the dialects sched as a Schedule v substance on September of 2018 epidemics would surely command a lot of off-label attention if not for the potent price tag and just as surely a huge unregulated market for hemp derived CBD isolate will continue to flourish in a tenuous legal environment an already massive consumer demand for CB products has far outpaced the gathering of clinical data on cannabinoid interactions with pharmaceuticals for pain cancer autism heart disease and many other chronic ailments concerning the product that the fda approved to treat two types of epilepsy researchers noticed the following adverse effects in clinical trials liver problems symptoms related to central nervous system such as irritability and lethargy reduced appetite gastrointestinal problems infections rashes and other sensitivity reactions reduce urination and breathing problems the patient information leaflet notes that there is a risk of worsening depression or suicidal thoughts it is important to monitor anyone who is using this drugs for signs of mood changes research suggests that a person taking the product is unlikely to form a dependency the long-standing Berry to research is a Schedule one status of cannabis a category reserved for dangerous substances with no medical value according to federal law but the paucity of federally sanctioned clinical research a consequence of cannabis prohibition should not be an excuse for physicians or patients to shun non-lethal cannabinoid therapies which show promise for a wide range of conditions when drugs do not have FDA approval it can be difficult to know whether a product contains a safe or effective level of CBD unapproved products may not have the properties or content stated on the package it is important to note that researchers have linked marijuana use during pregnancy to impairments in the fetal development of neurons regular use among teens is also associated with concerning memory behavior and intelligence CBD is just one of the many cannabinoids found in marijuana and it is not psychoactive smoking cannabis is not the same as using CBD oil and using CBD oil was not the same as smoking cannabis a person can use CBD oil in different ways to relieve various symptoms if a doctor prescribes it it's important to follow their instructions CBD products come in many forms some can be mixed into different foods or drinks and taken with a pipette or dropper others are available in capsules or as a thick paste to be massaged into the skin some products are available as sprays to be administered under the tongue recommended dosages vary between individuals and depend on factors such as body weight the concentration of the products and the health issue the studies done on CBD oil have a pretty wide dose range anywhere from a few milligrams to hundreds of milligrams it's suggested to start at the lower end around 10 milligrams and slowly increase over a few weeks or months to see what works for you some people also do well with splitting the dosage throughout the day instead of taking the dose all at once it is always a good idea to talk with your prescribing doctor if you are on any medications CBD is generally very safe but there are some pharmaceutical medications it could potentially interact with an increase or decrease the pharmaceutical drugs effectiveness some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild and defensible claims such as that CBD is a cure-all for cancer we need more research but CBD may prove to be an option for managing anxiety insomnia and chronic pain without sufficient high quality evidence in human studies we can't pinpoint effective doses and because CBD is currently mostly available as an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting if you decide to try CBD check with your doctor if for no other reason than to make sure it won't affect other medications that you're taking using CBD THC compounds in concert has been shown to help mitigate side-effects and enhance efficacy with CBD + THC showing more benefit for some conditions and THC alone studies have confirmed that CBD helps to counteract some of the sedative high feeling anxiety and rapid heartbeat that's associated with THC consumption it also has been found to extend the half-life of the THC which may help to extend the pain relieving benefits this has allowed the use of higher doses of THC in clinical trials for the treatment of pain caused by multiple sclerosis peripheral neuropathy intractable cancer pain and rheumatoid arthritis when used in concert a greater efficacy in treating these types of pain has been observed you may be wondering what is the ideal balance a ratio of CBD and THC every strain of Bud that you purchased at a dispensary will be labeled with its THC and CBD content and that's helpful when choosing a strain for pain relief thus far based on the observations regarding the ride spread use of cannabis flour and full spectrum cannabis oil it does not appear that there have been many problems because of cannabinoid drug reactions to the extent that there have been problematic drug interactions with cannabinoids these have involved high doses of CBD isolates not cannabis in general even though THC is an intoxicant and CBD is not the fact that people tend to use much higher doses of pure CBD makes it much riskier player in the metabolic drug interactions 10 milligrams of THC in a cannabis product is a hefty dose for a naive patient and sufficiently psychoactive for the occasional recreational user 10 milligrams of THC combined with equal amounts of CBD in a sativex tincture hits the energies exploit spot in clinical trials there are moderate doses compared to the amount of single molecule CBD administer to epileptic children in clinical trials up to 50 milligrams per kilogram with CBD doses as high as 2,000 milligrams not uncommon among patients who obtain CBD isolates from internet storefronts and other unregulated sources THC has its own built in guardrails consume too much and you'll know you've hit your limit with CBD there are no guardrails no dysphoric feedback loop that says you've had enough CBD is intrinsically safe but when extracting from the plant and concentrated as an isolate high doses are necessary for therapeutic efficacy unlike whole plant CBD rich extracts which have a broader therapeutic window and are effective at lower doses in a single molecule CBD drug interactions are much more likely with high dose CBD therapy than other forms of cannabis consumption physicians and patients should be concerned about this given the current regulatory regime with privileges CBD isolates over artisanal plant-derived multi-component formulations the legality CBD is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational use in use in some American states other states have approved the use of CBD oil as a hemp product but not the general use of medical marijuana some state and federal laws differ and current marijuana and CBD legislation in the United States can be confusing even in states where marijuana is legal there is an ever-changing number of states that do not necessarily consider marijuana to be legal but have laws directly related to CBD oil the following information is accurate as as of May 2018 but the laws change frequently however state legislators usually approve the use of CBD oil at various concentrations to treat a range of epileptic conditions a full list of states that have CBD specific laws is available different states also require different levels of prescriptions to possess and use CBD oil in Missouri for example a person can use CBD of a particular composition if they can show that three other treatment options have failed to treat their epilepsy they can provide information about safe CBD sausage sources and local laws surrounding uses anyone considering CBD oil should speak with a local healthcare provider it's also research your local state laws most states require a prescription my own state of Delaware has a medical marijuana program that currently has close to 7,000 patients thank you so much for watching my webinar on high CBD low THC product efficacy for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana programs I'm Ruth betrayin from Wyoming Delaware I have worked as a nurse for the past 13 years where I come face-to-face with various disease processes daily I'm a member of the American cannabis Nurses Association Delaware normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network I have been an advocate for marijuana since 1975 and I've lobbied at state and national levels for the past couple of years we hope to legalize recreational cannabis here in Delaware this year the legislators in my state decide the fate of marijuana so the only way to make change is to speak to them personally 61% of Delaware again support legalization of recreational cannabis I am by no means an expert on this topic but I recently worked in one of the medical marijuana dispensaries here in Delaware and I know of the pain and suffering the patient's endure for years before they finally get their doctor to agree that marijuana could help it's my hope that patients everywhere are able to utilize marijuana as a first line of defense in their medical treatment instead of it being a last resort I'd like to give a shout out to Jay and Riley mendler of Riley sunshine and thank them for all the hard work and dedication and their continued support of pediatric medical cannabis worldwide I'd also like to thank Delaware Normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network for the continued work towards legalization I'm going to close with the video done by a friend of mine Tommy Lyons he is a veteran who lives in Maryland and he's a medical marijuana patient thank you for watching hey everybody my name is Tommy Lyons and I'm a good friend of Ruth wanted to come on here today and talk to you about why I use CBD products from the cannabis plant specifically I'd like to state that I'm not representing any industry and I'm a registered and approved msec patient which means I have safe access to cannabis in Maryland I'm a service-connected disabled veteran and I use cannabis to offset various symptoms that come along with that I find that the CBD really helps target the symptoms from PTSD major depressive disorder and it helps me just kind of regain my calm I enjoy ac/dc I'm smoker and ac/dc is great it is very high in CBD and almost next to nothing in THC what that does for me is just give me a clear slate just makes me feel alright no high really but I'm not it's hard to say the word high anymore because it does different things for everybody but what we're finding is that the one thing it's doing across the board is providing an increase in quality of life and that's why I like cannabis and CBD it is important to use THC with the CBD to create what's called the entourage effect that was explained to me by a good friend of mine the old buddy old pal bill that CBD Rides and THC drives so you're in the car you've got THC and CBD working together CBD is kind of navigating telling the THC where to go and then the THC is like mmm just kind of takes off and then it's like a little bit too much so the CBD is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa come back here come back here get back to the speed limit so if you ever have too much THC for any reason use some CBD the CBD teamsters the drops that you put under your tongue that's a great way to medicate people are finding that to be very effective as a source to get the CBD into their system I usually recommend a ten to one texture which is ten part CBD and one part THC when it comes to THC and CBD in regard to dosing they're called Colorado doses ten milligrams of THC is one Colorado dose one milligram of CBD is one Colorado dose you can have as much CBD as you can intake you can't have too much CBD which is great you can't have too much THC or any other cannabinoid for that fact but the more you intake of certain cannabinoids the more potential you have for psychotropic psychedelic effects that you might not be looking for if you're looking for medicinal relief in regard to anxiety stress depression cancer looking for tumor reduction looking for symptom relief with HIV ADEs gastrointestinal issues post reconstructive surgery or any kind of surgery for that matter there are bombs THC and CBD bombs that are great for spot application for example if you're having elbow pain rub it right on the elbow there are compounds that are transdermally ingested so those are same things bomb and if you're having spot pain then you rub it on that and then you always rub it on your wrist where the skin is really thin and Venus because the compounds can either be spot application by themselves for spot application with transdermal properties so when it's transdermal and you rub it on the thin part of the skin it's gonna go full bloodstream which is going to give you a better chance for relief and fighting symptoms I've had a great opportunity to learn about cannabis I work as a dispensary technician at nature's care and wellness I'm also a patient consultant so I've worked with I have 3,000 patients that come into the store and I've gotten an opportunity to work with most of them and what we do is come up with plans in regard to how we can help figure this out come together get on a med excuse me get on a medical regimen and then find relief and it's working people keep coming back I've been working with people for over a year now and it works so it's really great to see people coming back people getting relief people's scams coming back clear people are kicking opiates I mean from going going from 280 milligrams a day down to nothing cannabis it's not just about the THC and CBD either there are many cannabinoids there are over 200 identified cannabinoids there are also terpenes which is the flavor and scent there's tart beans and everything stripping's and oranges tomatoes it's all over the place it's plant-based wellness and bringing these things together in an effort to find wellness as possible so it's great there are our CBD vapes CBD heavy vapes that are cannabis for example some strains that are really good are penny wise hardly sue tsunami harley quinn ac/dc shark shock blue dream blue dream is my favorite I've been using blue dream as my meds when I smoke they're the prettiest CBD buds I've ever seen and I mention that because I get relief when I open the bag smell it you know I take the milk out or break it open and just looking at it just makes me go I love that that's one thing about cannabis that you're not gonna get from any kind of prescription medication you're never gonna open up a bottle of pills and be like no it's just it's not like that there are capsules that you can ingest to get CBD and THC into your system there's also RS o which is Rick Simpson oil another good strain what CBD is a ray of sunshine and I've seen that in RSO tubes with a thousand milligrams total cannabinoids 600 milligrams CBD and 200 milligrams THC which is an amazing ratio because that's not going to get you too high but it is gonna get you some serious medicinal relief especially during the day the best way to consume that is called front lining it's a term that I coined basically dry out the inside of your gum with a paper towel have your meds ready pull the paper towel out so it's dry line the gums with the oil it's viscous and then let it sit there before you know it it's full blood streams called sublingual ingestion and it's really helping people alright everybody thank you so much for watching my video if there's anything I can do to help please let Ruth know and I'd be happy to follow up again my name is Tommy cannabis saves lives and that's what it's all about have a great day Thank You Ruth for that informative presentation I'd also like immigrants for making today's educational webcast possible as a final reminder our speaker will follow up with any questions you've submitted via email that's all for now thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time", "bssGLDvoBT8": "[Music] in two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "ucw8dRNNCv4": "MAINTAIN A STRONG BOND EVEN\nTHROUGH THE

contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope

I will leave how to make cannabutter in the description box below so you can go look at that video after or before and Super simple to make it's really nice for inflammation, pain it's a lotion it's not a salve there's a lot of videos out there in that say lotion but it's a salve so a lotion is 75% water and 25% oil so it goes on nice and That goes on like a lotion it absorbs nicely and yeah, so we'll get into the video right now So here is the infused coconut oil. I will leave a Description of that in the box below and so what you'll need is 2 x 8 ounce containers. It does make 16 ounces And you'll need two heat safe measuring cups. Preferably larger ones at least one large one you want to be mixing in that one and you'll need two thermometers and a hand blender Rubbing alcohol is super important when you're making a lotion because of contamination. So you want to just Sanitize anything that comes in contact with your lotion including your thermometers forks of the blender The bowl itself, spoons just cover ground so you avoid any sort of bacterial growth And so here is the oil things. We will be using the cannabutter (cannabis butter) I'm setting it to ounces So you'll want to keep the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, and this just ensures that The oils have properly melted, it reduces contamination and it helps to emulsify. So keep track of the time and a temperature I'm just pouring the oil into the water, but you could pour the water into the oil I'll be using the blender here Just follow the instructions on that and it will be mixing here for a good two minutes on two minutes off two minutes on For a good like 10 minutes and here the consistency has turned into a lotion it is really nice and creamy and So at this point you could try using a funnel. I tried just I sort of mix it a bit too much in a way and not thick so Here, I'm just using my own piping bag. Well a makeshift one and I will be squeezing it into the containers And so the squeeze bottles are the way to go because it reduces contamination That is it on how to make your own cannabis lotion. It's really easy to make it is a two-step process So I will link the video in the description box below and I will link it here As well if you want to learn how to make that I'm pretty good for different types of things I mean, it's just a generally a nice moisturizer for your body, but you can use it on inflammation If you have like any sort of eczema or psoriasis, I personally have psoriasis Scalp psoriasis and it's going on my forearm, but I've noticed that it actually helps with the itchiness. It seems to tame down the inflammation It's good for pain neuropathy pain sore muscle so really broad spectrum use Yeah, it absorbs really nicely the lotion There we go it doesn't go on really greasy it absorbs really nicely The last lotion that I made was specifically for dry hands. So if you do have dry hands like me Check that out really nice video for that. So I hope you guys have a good day And I will see you guys in the next video. Okay. Bye", "fejytAIWC_g": "hey I wanted to do a review on penat ryx and Charlotte's webs hemp infused Bahman which one worked for me so I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues and I just wanted to do like kind of like my take so after using this product and it's almost all gone for a solid couple of months actually maybe like two months or w-mint three in terms of pain relief it smells really nice so it's not like like we agents have this or we call this like white flour or something like that and it's really abrasive to the eyes it's really drying on your skin but it feels amazing just because the menthol on this is is intense and so I will douse myself with this before but it was really drying like I said and really abrasive to other people too like they could smell it immediately in your leg oh you're an old Asian grandma and on a 32 year old young lady so I opted for this first so this is called penetrations and this is well reviewed on Amazon and I would have to say what I was using it for is like my shoulder I have a little like shoulder impingement cuz I sleep on my side and things get pinched that way I've tried so many different ways on how to sleep but I've found a different solution this is always like things like this things like this they're always just little band-aids that help you very short-term in terms of pain relief and it's not even pain relief it's kind of like just a distraction it's not really addressing the source of your pain it's a it's a nice distraction so when you're you know when you're trying to work or whatever and you've got an ache in your neck or whatever and you have this burning cool sensation it distracts you from I think the pain I don't that's just my take on it I know it's not solving the problem but anyway this seemed to I guess be something different other than those types of products because it's an inflammation formula so if you have chronic pain it's probably because the the area or the joint or the muscle is inflamed and so no amount of stretching or like working out is really going to help you because it's still inflamed it's in a state of emergency basically so in order for you to like for myself like my knee for example or my shoulder or this like chronic muscle that was underneath my shoulder blade and it's really hard to get to gets really tight and it would cause actually migraines a lot and I would use this and you see I've run through this this container and it was just okay and I really didn't see any difference I think it was a lot better in terms of yes calming down the tissue than this guy but again if I wasn't gonna follow through like this is kind of like taking it's a topical like I guess an ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory that doesn't have to go through your liver to calm down the inflammation of the area or the affected area but if you don't follow through after calming down the inflamed area it stays weak or it stays unconditioned so for me for this example I was putting this and yes it was helping the inflammation and for me to not feel any pain but I wasn't doing anything to make sure that I wasn't going to keep that chronic injury there so I needed to do something physical where I could train those muscles or the muscles around it to activate and that way that one muscle wasn't doing all the work you know and I'm saying so there's a process right so if you're in pain and the area's inflamed yes these things in my experience do work but I went through a whole container worth and didn't realize like there's a second process to that which is to do something physical which trains that muscle not to be weak anymore because that's that's usually why you're in pain is because something is out of balance something is weak and this particular muscle that's always tied are always aching it's compensating for the rest of your weakness you're weak so that's that so I'm basically all out and on my journey of pain relief I also stumbled across things like CBD oil now I'm just about done with this guy and I was doing this is my second bottle full bottle like this and this is a 30 milliliters so one fluid ounce very small and their recommended dosage is one drop in the morning one drop at night or two two drops to full droppers okay and shake well before using and it tastes really good it tastes like minty chocolate stuff so it's in my experience it was kind of mouth drying always kind of got a cotton mouth feel I don't take it anymore I'm just about done but I haven't even touched this in a couple of weeks and I was trying to take this for like anxiety or oh yeah like if I have this pain here if I just take it will it just handle all the things in my body I don't know I can't really say if this works or not because at the same time I was also practicing yoga which to me in my example the whole shoulder blade thing the knee thing the hip thing the only thing that's really been I feel helping is yes these like step one little baby step one and then step two which is a big step which is to start training start conditioning those muscles so that you stop staying in this crappy injured in flame state that brings me to this okay so this is fairly new maybe about two to three weeks the use of this this is the 1.5 ounce soothing scent hemp infused balm from Charlotte's Web I love this smell it smells really good at submit it's like a minty my settlement enos doesn't burn your eyes when you apply it close to your face unless you put it like right here so I usually use this because I'm still getting that shoulder impingement not as bad as I used to used to wake up with headaches but yeah definitely using this in tandem with my yoga has been I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more progress and a lot more strengthen and how I'm gauging that is just by doing regular everyday tasks so going up and down the stairs seeing if I could jog for like a little jaunt from the kitchen to the to the living room if I got excited about something or to run to the restroom like I'm that's how I'm gauging my progress and before I couldn't do that especially when I had done when I had injured my knee and so I've been applying this pretty regularly to my knee and before when I was doing yoga whenever I knelt down on to my knee onto the kneecap it was very painful and so I would just kind of find ways around it in terms of the yoga like still doing downward dog still doing forward fold still doing everything that I could you know it was really just the ones where I had my kneecap on the floor so I've been applying this directly to it and I've only started doing that for probably the last two weeks because for some reason you just I don't know when you're in an injured state you don't really think of all the ways you think of I don't know that's just been my experience and and that's been a transformation in my mind when you are chronically injured and maybe you have many things wrong with you it's kind of hard to keep track it's kind of hard to keep up with all of your issues but I encourage you to think of your body as a full system and so if your knee hurts it's not just about your knee it's about your hip it's about your quads about your hamstrings about your calves I always forget about my calves is about your ankles so that your your body's a whole system and so this has enabled me to I feel been very effective anti-inflammatory I'm not taking advil or ibuprofen for anything really the only thing that I really take ibuprofen for is if I have a feel of massive headache coming on and maybe I can prevent a migraine and then I'll maybe I'll take some or if I'm you know I have cramps or something that's the only reason why I would take that so I'm trying to minimize as much drugs as possible that I'm taking into my body and just doing these topical things that you just rub and they smell so good too and it is very I in my experience effective that I feel in my body as an anti-inflammatory agent which is pretty cool so and they and I think they make that distinction you know this has 450 milligrams of hemp extract and I've seen it go as far as to like a thousand milligrams and I'm like whew maybe that will like make it make my healing even faster because um right now with the yoga and I've been doing yoga for a good 45 days I think that's a good estimate maybe 50 days pretty regularly pretty like maybe I've missed two days and then I just did it the next day or something like that and that's given me the strength to go and do deadlifting I'm now lifting again when I was completely invalid for like a good three months or something when I when I injured my knee so that's been my experience with this this and this um so yeah not taking recap not taking this anymore I feel the yoga has replaced what I have seeked out in not gonna buy this anymore this is about 20 bucks I think and I think it and I think it does work when I was using it it's just that you need to follow through you can't just put it on to be like why am I not better yet you have to follow through physically emotionally mentally all the things I like this a lot better just because it's a little bit cheaper and and I feel like it lasts longer too cuz this is more like a this is more like a cream and this is more like a wax and like I can both they had a very similar scent this one like very kind of minty yeah mm-hmm they both smell really good I like both of them this one's just a little bit cheaper but it takes forever to get to you so maybe this is a better option I don't know it'll just kind of depend on my mood when when I go to refill this one but this I feel like it's lasting Mia quite a bit so I'll just put three of my fingers in here rub it on I'll do it before and after a workout or like when I remember to or if I'm particularly feeling little stabs of pain in my knee or in my neck and stuff and I just feel better and I've been using this for maybe good three months or so so that's been my experience any specific questions I'd love to you know answer your questions in the comments and maybe you know it'll work for you too and like I said these things are just temporary fixes and they and make you feel a little bit better for the time being but you have to follow through with all the things and try to think of your body as a as a whole system you know not even just your body like your mental state like are you do you really want to get better are you using your chronic illness as an excuse for not living I know that so yeah thanks for watching see you next time", "kfbXm_0iTg8": "[Music] so let's now take a look at our topical collection we have got some amazing products that people are absolutely loving our most popular is our CBD salve our CBD salve is available in two sizes it's available in a one ounce container that contains 500 milligrams of CBD and then our 2 ounce container that contains 1000 milligrams of CBD there's only 4 ingredients in these products organic hemp extract oil or our CBD oil we use a certified organic beeswax a certified organic lavender and a certified organic eucalyptus people love the smell of this product they love the effect of the product so again this is our number one selling topical our CBD salve [Music]", "3P9Dz3G-nIo": "it's a great day to talk cbd creams and oils for topical pain relief i'm dr donald fabio cbd from hemp oil is what we're going to be talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "zYFmmX2MxZQ": "Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from\nSpineCare in St. Joseph, MI. In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can.

with old rosin pucks the other day if you check it out on YouTube so we teach the infused coconut oil so with that we are going to make lip balm so you need some honey vitamin E another flavor here a butter vanilla some cute little containers we got from the dollar store here and some beeswax you need a microwave a measuring cup and that's about it so we have here in this is the bee's wax melted and there's a half a cup I would just stuck it on microwave i gradually melted it took about four minutes stirring it in about 40 seconds or so long and then we have our tht infused coconut oil same same measurement half a cup vitamin E we need about 4 teaspoons of vitamin E which I had to poke out of these little capsule things put into here and then same amount 4 teaspoons of honey and then we're going to do a couple drops of the butter vanilla pour them in our containers let them sit for half an hour and then we got lip balm okay so we've melted the beeswax right now we are going to pour in the infused coconut oil okay constantly stirring okay then we're gonna add the four teaspoons of I mean four teaspoons of honey they're going away he's starting to harden that's why sorry about that I never use a little quicker I started mouth or hardening I just get the microwave for a couple seconds I put in there for 25 seconds and now we're gonna saw them melted mixing it together I didn't add the butter vanilla so we're gonna add let's see 1 teaspoon of that just and therefore little extra flavor okay stir it up and then we are going to pour it into our bomb containers close the top as possible so a little work here a little over there the container here here don't mind me okay oh [ __ ] shoot Jamie okay anyone leave the lid off for about a half an hour because you can see it starting to harden like see how that fell there and it's hardening leave it for what a half an hour I put the lids on and that's that a little bit extra here so we're gonna find some or containers and see what I can do with it thanks for watching we'll be back in about a half an hour to show you the end result thank you it's been about a half an hour and we poured our ingredients into the containers and they as you can see they've hardened so we got some bigger containers here is too small I went along sugai off Amazon I'm gonna see here see how about THC infused coconut oil lip balm so yeah like showed us thanks to West Coast croppers for helping me out and check us out at samantha star cookies and or west coast coppers thank you you", "e6dD81GhgiI": "welcome back to the demystifying medicine youtube channel today we will be discussing cannabis and parkinson's disease parkinson's disease also known as pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder studies have tried to find a cause for pd either genetic or environmental but none have been confirmed the disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia negra which is an area of the brain responsible for movement this means that the cells in the brain that create dopamine are no longer doing so the death of these neurons causes loss of motor control because dopamine is important for relaying messages to plan muscle movements this leads to the motor symptoms of pd including tremors muscle rigidity and bradykinesia which means slowness of movement there are some non-motor symptoms of the disease as well including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping the risk of developing pd increases with age especially above the age of 60. the prevalence of pd in the us was 680 000 in 2010 and was projected to be 930 000 in 2020 with the prevalence of this disease continually increasing there's a need for new treatment options and cannabis could be a potential treatment for pd cannabis is a drug illicit in some parts of the world that has both psychoactive and therapeutic effects it is an umbrella term that is given to various preparations of the plant cannabis sativa and has other common names such as marijuana weed and pot cannabis contains many compounds known as cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemical substances that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body this can be visualized as a key which is the cannabinoid fitting into a lock which is the receptor the most common cannabinoids present in cannabis are thc and cbd cannabinoids due to differences in their chemical properties can have varying effects in the body thc is accountable for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and produces the high sensation cbd works to control or reduce some of the psychoactive effects of thc such as anxiety specifically thc and cbd work in the endocannabinoid system in our body which affects different parts of the central nervous system along with cellular communication which is why changes in the system can be linked to parkinson's disease currently the most common medication prescribed for pd is levodopa also known as l-dopa when aldopa reaches the brain it is converted into dopamine and therefore compensates for the decrease in dopamine due to pd however research has shown that some patients fail to respond to treatment with l-dopa furthermore the drug has been associated with adverse side effects and motor complications over time including involuntary movements called dyskinesias in the last decade there has been an increased focus on investigating the therapeutic potential of cbd in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as pd most human clinical trials have been concentrated on the non-motor symptoms of the disease including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping with results indicating that cbd is successful in treating many of these symptoms although less research has focused on the effects of cbd on motor symptoms a 2004 study using a survey aimed to evaluate the experiences of parkinson's patients using cannabis to help treat their disease the results of this study showed that bradykinesia was the symptom most improved by cannabis followed by muscle rigidity and tremors research has focused on various pathways in which cbd could treat the motor symptoms of pd a 2014 study using a mouse model made it an important discovery regarding the gpr6 receptor gpr6 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is molecularly similar to the cannabinoid receptors this study showed that a deficiency of the gpr-6 receptor in a mouse model of parkinson's disease led to an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain furthermore it led to reduced dyskinesia caused by treatment with l-dopa although this has yet to be tested in humans mice are accurate and commonly used animal models for human disease using the results found in the study in 2017 a research team tested the effects of cannabinoids on the gpr6 receptor their results showed that cbd acts as an inverse agonist to the gpr6 receptor this means that cbd binds to gpr6 decreasing the activity of the receptor and therefore leading to an increase in dopamine this research has identified cbd as a potential therapy for treating the motor symptoms of pd without the negative side effects caused by aldoba although these findings are very promising more research needs to be done on the topic with more clinical trials to show the effects of cbd in humans with pd now that we've discussed the effects of cannabis in the body let's review physicians perspectives on treatment of pd with medical marijuana animal investigations support suggestions of improvement in bradykinesia and tremors but this is unsubstantiated in human studies some patients have reported that marijuana diminishes some motor non-motor cognitive and or mood symptoms of pd 18 studies investigated medical practitioners perspectives on this none of these studies presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medical cannabis in a separate study physicians were asked to indicate the degree to which the use of cannabis is evidence-based for various symptoms of pd 87 of physicians felt that the literature supported the use of cannabis for nausea 60 for anxiety and 86 for pain responses were divided with regard to motor symptoms in fact only 36 percent of physicians believed cannabis could help parkinson's patients with tremors and 35 for symptoms like dyskinesia researchers need to clarify the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy with cannabis products or medical marijuana will remain largely without scientific endorsement research has to document the full benefits risks and clinical applications of marijuana as a treatment for patients with pd medical practitioners attribute a self-perceived lack of knowledge as a significant barrier to approval a study conducted by edelstein at al revealed that 95 of participants had no formal education about medical marijuana 84.6 reported being unprepared to answer clients questions that were cannabis related medical practitioners also raised issues about the potential for recreational misuse diversion into illicit channels the risk of drug drug interactions driving under the influence of cannabis and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled supply finally rey's concern for the health of individual patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects more than 10 million people worldwide are living with pd and the incidence of parkinson's only increases with age when such a large portion of the population has an incurable disease it is essential that we explore every possible therapy to help improve their quality of life medical cannabis is a promising therapy for pd and requires further research to investigate its potential as a new and exciting treatment for the disease thank you so much for watching also remember

renal carcinoma he was in the intractable pain and anything that we gave to him was of no benefit and so therefore we he came to me and said I'd like to try cannabis and what do you think and quite frankly at that point I had no knowledge about it whatsoever nor did my colleagues I thought about it and and after he came back and had a very particularly terrible experience because the person who was supposed to help him could not help him and it was about seven or eight years ago in Los Angeles before that was when was only medical and so I decided I was going to learn more about this and as I learned about it I wrote about it and have been speaking about it but more importantly I wanted to share my knowledge with my colleagues because this is a patient driven and a patient driven medication and people want to know about it and it's only the best thing for your medical care to know about it I'm in no way advocating it I'm just simply saying knowledge is important so with that I want to proceed the responsibility of a urologist I believe is to just know a little bit about or even more about the use of the cannabis now it just the tip of the iceberg is some of the conditions that may be helped and we'll talk about those conditions in a moment but there is so much to learn about cannabis and one of the problems is that because it's Schedule one that is it's not allowed really to be researched within the universities the Schedule one has prevented and has become an obstacle to knowledge which i think is wrong so all of us end up having anecdotes and stories by patients and that is not the best way of guiding our care for the patient we really need to have evidence base on medicine and that evidence-based medicine will come but first the obstacle of being on schedule one like heroin or LSD has to be overcome 95 percent of us live in a state in that has either medical or fully legal matter of marijuana and only if you live in Nebraska South Dakota or Idaho is a completely prohibited otherwise your patients have the access to medical or for that matter recreational but we're doling and we talking about access to obtaining marijuana for medical purposes interestingly enough it's been illegal for so many years and it's been it's been considered to be dangerous all the way back into the 30s and far before that but in the 30s when there was reefer madness or than the 40s movies that that portrayed it as as a terrible drug well if you go back you find out that the Declaration in penance was written on hemp paper and so people have known about this for a long time the consumption of cannabis is based on speed rate of metabolism and choice there are various methods by which you can you can consume you can smoke or you can vape you can hear this person is using a bong which is water pipe you can consume in in candy or foods of some sort and what happens is that if the person takes cannabis by smoking or vaping you they get a much rep more rapid concerned by the cannabis you it's eaten it's a much slower effect because it has to be metabolized well under those circumstances some people will take one or two pieces of candy or or a brownie or a piece of candy in a candy bar and say oh nothing's happening and then they'll take a second or third piece and by the time the third piece or fourth piece is ever consumed the the effect will become multiplied that's why people need to be very cautious when they take medication through food which is metabolized now it's very interesting to me that the vascular system the lymphatic system and the nervous system have all been well described for hundreds of years and yet the endocannabinoid system was only discovered in 1992 and as you can see from the receptors the receptor of CB 1 which is THC which is more the the portion that people think about when they think about affect psychologically or neurologically or cv2 which is also known as CBD and people think well how can possibly have a medication or a drug that affects all parts of the body I mean literally soup to nuts and we are urologist we know the difference and so we have to wonder what is it about this drug this Mitali the CBD or TC that really affects everything well the fact is that there are different receptors for CB 1 against CB 2 and CB 2 are principally the ones that that will affect things that your urologist want to take care of particularly in reducing inflammation or reducing pain and so when you understand that the receptors throughout the body are different then you understand why CBD and THC and generally marijuana will affect different people in different ways the facts of about cannabis are that it's been used for thousands of years and it's but I showed you the number of states 33 states and history Columbia where it's medicinal should be um this Columbia is also recreational um it's off-limits for scientific investigation it's classified as Schedule one as I mentioned be same as heroin and LSD and in fact there's more research been done on heroin and LSD than on marijuana because of all the laws and truly became a and has become a political plant and there's limited evidence for abuse yes it can be abused but there is limited evidence and that's once again because the research does not allow people to really find out what is in that plant the plant has a hundred and forty-four chemicals within it and we only know of a few so cannabis and evidence-based medicine is critical in my mind because that's what we've been working on as to clinicians all of our professional lives patient values and preferences and best evidence and clinical expertise all Center in evidence-based medicine and since it is truly a patient driven medication people don't will not go to a doctor generally speaking a urologist and say what do you think I should take and the urologist starts off by saying take cannabis that's not going to happen what happens is the patient comes in and says I want to take cannabis how will that affect me because it's um it's been controversial and and promoted by lots of different organizations and groups and of people finally the National Academy of Sciences the medicine looked at it and put out in nineteen ninety nine twenty one years ago of a book that showed that the it is effective conclusively effective for chronic pain nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy that is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as well as muscle spasm and MS now those are the three things that that the National Academy is founded it is conclusively helpful for but there are complications and that's why the complications and pediatrics and pregnancy is that you the grade there is greater number of NICU NICU admissions in women who smoke marijuana or consume marijuana while pregnant there's also premature births and underweight well you think about it if those women were to take any other drug even alcohol for example or or other drugs such as cocaine which are much much more addictive of course they too would get greater number of ICU admissions and premature deaths that doesn't excuse it but it just shows you that that drugs are bad for pregnant women there's no conclusive evidence that it causes heart attacks strokes and diabetes it doesn't cause respiratory diseases such as chronic like chronics cigarette smoking there is some thought that if you smoke every day multiple marijuana cigarettes it would have some lung disease or issues but knowing very very very few people do that and actually including in California for decades people were smoking considerable amounts of marijuana and and studies show that they really were not affected like they would be had they been smoking cigarettes it does not improve immune competence and some people have even thought it would be good for treatment of testicular cancer there's no evidence of that whatsoever but for cardiovascular effects it does elevate systolic and diastolic soon aunt after consuming marijuana causes tachycardia increases sympathetic stimulation decreases a time to angina and there is a slight increase in Aminah and MI for one hour post marijuana use so now just like everything else in life you gotta take consideration any comorbidities and so therefore if someone were to have significant cardiovascular disease you would say that it's a bad idea to smoke marijuana for any purpose now another myth is that it's a gateway drug that has been disproven repeatedly and yet it is repeatedly spoken about and so it's all you can do is try and try again the National Academy of Medicine in the Institute of Medicine in 1999 the same book that I reference before has indicated that it is not a gateway drug but what we really need is research not anecdotes so that people will be able to know what - if it indeed is helpful another myth is that it causes cancer does not and when a person comes in to be seen and they ask about cannabis in the medical in a minute and see that only has medical marijuana and frankly just the knowledge of knowing what in a state that has recreational as well or adult use as well the you just have to say let us look at what is eat what is allowed in each state and that is for the medical purposes but and also it's good reference for you to be able to determine whether or not there's medical marijuana that would be helpful in any particular state and you can say well I guess that's at least anecdotally if not evidence-based that it might be helpful so for example in Illinois interstitial cystitis is a qualifying condition for the use of cannabis and so if a person were in California and they said well I've got painful spasms because of interstitial cystitis you could say to yourself well it is allowed in Illinois there may be proof that it is helpful and I I can't god I cannot prescribe it but I certainly can say that it is recommended or at least possibly used in Illinois cachexia due to cancer is another common condition that is that people use cannabis for to stimulate their appetite terminal illness hospice care chemotherapy induced nausea muscle spasms that's why I put in interstitial cystitis here because if it helps them MS muscle spasms maybe an interstitial cystitis as well or for that matter other muscle spasms it's it's been stating to me how well in Parkinson's spinal stenosis spinal cord disorders and we course see patients that have and have those conditions which resulting geologic illness PTSD rheumatoid arthritis sickle cell anemia at least the pain associated with it intractable pain and every state has the the ability or I should say has stated that if doctors find a condition that is diagnosed as debilitating then marijuana in a medical state can be recommended pain is the most common reason for for using the medical marijuana 100 million Americans have chronic pain and so this is the reason why chronic pain is the most common by far and away the most common reason why people use medical marijuana others is multiple sclerosis chemotherapy induced vomiting nausea and cancer as I listed before so you can see that over 50% of the people will want to use medical marijuana for chronic pain why again why 50% greater 50% use marijuana for pain well in 2016 214 million prescriptions of opioids were used more than 60 million Americans consumed acetaminophen on a weekly basis over 30 billion doses of NSAIDs were were given and 80 million aspirins are consumed a day not all of course are for pain but that's 117 aspirin tablets for every man woman and child in the United States the opioid crisis in the United States is is absolutely an epidemic and unfortunately know about epidemics now but is that an epidemic rate as many as one in five whose are opioid addicted received opioids as prescription for non-cancer pain 11 million abusing opioids and a million thousand people are go to the ER every day for opioid misuse the the most chilling thing is 72 thousand people who die every year and that is more deaths there are more deaths since a year 2004 opioid than all the deaths that occurred on the battlefields in every war since 1775 it is a spectacular amount of people who have have died and as it turns out marijuana is a could be a substitute II and some individuals and does not kill and this is the reason why it doesn't kill I think that this is the most important slide there is why do opioids kill and T C does not and the reason is the receptors the the cannabis receptors are in the in this portion of the brain and in the cerebellum the opioids are in the this portion but most importantly they are in the brain stem for breathing and so this is the reason why opioids kill and cannabis does not there has never been a death due to overdose of cannabis but seventy-two thousand people a year die of cannabis overdose in the United States as time has gone on it's become more and more legal in various states but more importantly and in this particular sideshows it that Americans believe it should that medical marijuana for sure should be legalized sixty-two percent versus thirty four percent and just in 1969 when when I went I was when I was in college in medical school 84 percent thought of what should be illegal and only twelve percent legal so attitudes have change and that's why your patients are coming in to talk to you about it so the summary is cannabis is safe it is not a gateway drug and it has several urological applications you can see that annual desk 435,000 from tobacco seventy five thousand from opioids none none from marijuana a hundred from peanuts so you can see that even even peanuts are more dangerous than marijuana the finally one joke by Bill Murray I find it quite ironic that most dangerous the most dangerous thing about about weed is getting caught with it so the dangers are few the the potential benefit is great and in it in this particular talk I hope I was not trying to convince you to use it but I'm trying to come to you about and educate you about why some people do so thank you very much if you wish to contact me there is my email address I wish you a great day thank you", "UOHqixhs_Hs": "come on come on do you go do you like sweet baby boy alright we'll go after hi welcome to Angel's anything show thanks for coming on over it's good to see you today is a very special episode because I am gonna go through some items in this beautiful box that was not sent to me I picked it up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but", "u9FL4mIM6jU": "dr lim is an

can hear me thank you for that uh wonderful introduction alana it's my pleasure to be here um it was very comprehensive that's uh the introduction i'm not sure how much else i need to see but um just to reiterate i am an internal medicine specialist and i am very interested in the medical cannabis space um one of the reasons um that i got involved with this with this area was because i had my patients um or i explored the the cannabis uh with my patients and found that there was some profound benefits but there was a big lack of data and so the clinics um that i have worked and founded um with is a multi-disciplinary clinic and we are data-driven so our goals are to look at the data to collect the data and to better understand what cannabis can be used for and that's what i'm hoping to share with you today because parkinso disease is one of those diseases that there isn't just one thing that parkinson's patients suffer from there's a host of things and the current standard of treatment isn't if i could be honest and frank isn't great um and so um a lot of patients are seeking um other alternatives and that's what i'm hoping to be able to share and shed some light into uh today because i think cannabis does have a role okay so um as uh a summary of what we're going to talk about um we'll talk about a general overview of some parkinson's theory uh we'll look at the cannabis uh overview and then we'll go to some frequently asked questions okay so uh parkinson's disease right and so um when you look at the causes of parkinson's disease this is just a summary for what i think many of the attendees here probably already know there is things like um you know there's a genetic component to it um like michael j fox there's environmental causes you know listed here some pesticides and carbon monoxide there's this very interesting um thought that's going out right now about this gut brain connection whereby a lot of the gut microbiome actually causes influence to our mind and how we think and it can lead to some um to some changes that cause parkinsonian like uh symptoms then there are you know risk factors like age and a family history males are more likely to get parkinson's than females environmental exposures and then essentially what happens in parkinson's is that you get this breakdown of the nerve cells um and it's mostly the dopamine releasing nerve cells which is why things like the the standard of treatment is like cinnamon or carbidopa which tries to replace the the dopamine and the idea is that some of the symptoms of parkinson's and you'll see as we go through the theory that not all of them can be explained with just dopamine-releasing cells which is why that cinnamon only addresses some of the symptoms of parkinson's so this was a theory that was proposed that i really really liked and it talks about parkinson in stages um and so most people don't re most people when they think about parkinson's disease they think of you know things like the cardinal symptoms which is the bretokinesia which is a slowing of the movements you know or the pill rolling tremor um or they look a bit flat in terms of how they look right or they start tripping um but that you'll see here actually is kind of a later uh a later stage usually in the stage three right so but parkinson's disease may start as early as stage one and this is why i like this because there are subtle features of parkinson's that may um that may be um present before what people think like ah you must have parkinson's or they they start noticing the pill rolling tremor and that's when people start screening for it so when you look at it you know the in the first steps of parkinson's um or the first stage you lose things that are more non-specific so you get less spell you get things like you get constipated and that's as you go up from the brain stem up to the higher levels of the brain okay so just to give everyone here an idea or a review this this is our brain here and you'll see that um the lower parts of the brain are what's called the the more rudimentary parts this is like for you know your breathing center um and what differentiates us as humans is more the upper brain which is our complex thinking and our critical thinking so this stuff down here in the brain stem you know the the green and the whatever stage one it's sort of a yellow green um that's sort of the the primitive centers in our brain okay and so that's where you get things like constipation and smell and then as you move up you start to affect some of the substantia [ __ ] which is um which is where you usually um cause problems um and that's when you start getting symptoms like okay you get these odd pains that really you know you really can't necessarily pinpoint you get some mood just mood issues um fluctuating mood this is where people start noticing sleep right and so sleep is is um one of the things that's really affected in in patients with parkinson's right and you'll see here that you can imagine that when patients present in stage one or stage two it's rather difficult to say that yeah this person has uh parkinson's because these could be from lots of different things right sinus issues poor sleep could be from stress you know mood can also be from stress so it's not until you get to stage three that people start noticing things like okay you're moving slowly you're getting more rigid you're getting some freezing and then that's when you get the pill rolling tremor and then when you look back you start seeing that oh yeah i had all these other symptoms too but what's interesting also is that parkinson's doesn't stop at stage three right and so as you move up into stage four stage five stage six you start affecting other things that actually become more significant right so as you move up you get more emotional problems that's when you start getting more long-term problems and as you can follow this arrow up the brain as it goes up higher and higher you start getting more and more of the um of the areas in the brain uh that makes us unique as humans okay so the critical thinking the memory um the planning the executive planning and so this is parkinson's and i think it's really nice um overview um so just as a very general review all that i really wanted to show here was these are the cardinal symptoms of parkinson's these are like what people think of as classic but this is not all that parkinson patients deal with right because there's a lot of mood issues in parkinson's patients that may go under appreciated there's psychotic uh things that people can start to hallucinate and then there's cognitive like the dysfunction of thinking fatigue is a big thing you know we don't treat very well sleep disturbance is also probably related to fatigue and all of this is just trying to say that if we look at parkinson's we have to look beyond the pill rolling tremor or just the tremor we have to look beyond that we have to look beyond just the rigidity because there's so much more in terms of what affects our park a patient who deals with parkinson's um their quality of life what affects their quality of life pain is also a big one and so here more features you know you can look at them i'm sure that uh for the guests here or the attendees here who suffer from parkinson's they don't necessarily need to read this list because it's something that they already experience in their lives or in the lives of their loved ones so now let's go to uh cannabis so very briefly let's just talk about what like cannabis overview okay so cannabis is a plant this is a plant um there's two different types there's actually three different types of cannabis there's sativa indica and rudoralis root oralis doesn't really have any medicinal properties so i've left it out for the most part in the can sativa are more historical the way that canada has been growing because most of our products are hybrids and it just you know for the most part with the only thing i want to tell you about sativa and indica because you will experience this or you will come across this if you are looking at cannabis treatment is that the cbd or the thc okay which are your cannabinoids that you find in sativa and indica are exactly the same so that was one thing that i never quite realized when i first got into this into this field which is you know cbd if you get it from sativa sativa or cbd if you get it from indica is exactly the same same with the thc they're chemically the same what differs in the sativa and in the indica plants are mostly the terpenes okay which i'll talk about and the minor cannabinoids okay so um cannabinoids are these unique molecules um they're actually not necessarily only found in cannabis they can be found in other plants but for the most part they're found in cannabis um that that um affect the the the host usually through the endocannabinoid system cbd thc are the most predominant of the cannabinoids okay terpenes um are these other uh molecules that are found within the cannabis plant that essentially gives it the fragrance so you know when you smell the cannabis you can smell that's the terpenes but they also have medicinal properties um and in actual fact um terpenes are usually from other plants okay so like spices have terpenes like parsley has terpene and then they've just bred into the cannabis um out in the wild okay but again the only thing i want to mention here is terpenes by themselves have a have medicinal properties and when you combine terpenes with the cannabinoids there's some thought that they may act more synergistically together all right so how can you these are the these are the ways that you can take cannabis i'm going to talk about how cannabis can be used in parkinson's but just generally how can you take what are the methods of consumption or modes of consumption so you know the most common that most people think of is smoking okay this in our clinic is the least favored why is it the least favorite a it's hard to control what you actually get because you're smoking the entire joint for instance um and you may be trading a benefit for uh a long-term um side effect or not a long-term side effect but a long-term problem okay so like why would you get pain control and then get lung problems like why why do that when there's another way to take it if you are you know there's some good things about it because if you do smoke or vaporize it's it has a faster onset but it also comes off less it also wears off quicker if you're going to smoke though try to use a water a bong because it has a water filter on it vaporize is the other way that i think most people may see out in you know in the public and this one you can use usually is you have a dried flower and you put it into a vaporizer it heats it up and you know under different uh temperatures or or boiling points you can you can vaporize the cannabinoids and you inhale it this one you know there's probably some benefit to it uh because it's again very fast onset so if you're in pain you can you can get a you can you can take a puff of the vaporized uh product and you can get effect within usually about five or ten minutes but it also doesn't last that long it usually lasts for about an hour or two the most common in our clinic is usually in the oral route so either a sublingual buccal or a or a capsule okay and so usually you can use you know you hold it for 45 to 60 seconds underneath your tongue the big things to note here is that when you're taking an oral route whether it's underneath the tongue or an edible like like a capsule it can take up to two hours uh to onset okay edibles include capsules and and um with fixed doses and also edibles can include um uh baked foods or like cookies we usually for medical uh don't use uh edibles like gummies because again you you oftentimes trade one problem for another like these high sugary cookies or high sugary gummy bears um and so it has only a little bit of of cbd or thc in it uh mostly cbd and then you take all that sugar in and then there's topical that's coming out on the market um soon or it's there's some products already out on the market i think this has a lot of this has a lot of potential for localized pain um so how can cannabis help in parkinson's this is not just how can cannabis help in general but this is remember this my talk is specific for parkinson's patients how can it help so there are four really four main areas that we in our clinic have seen it having benefits okay so in sleep in pain in the tremor and in anxiety or mood disorders so what does the data show this is the truth about cannabis so is cannabis a miracle drug that cures everything okay so obviously the answer is is no right um is cannabis a real medication now normally in my powerpoint slide these would come up one at a time but in this in this way it just all pops up at the same time so um i sort of give away my answers right away but yes it's a real drug and here's what it can it can help for and we have we have really good emerging evidence that it's useful in things like pain in poor sleep in tremors anxiety and ptsd seizures um and inflammation okay so here's the stats here's what it looks like this is this is real life data from our from my clinic okay so this is for pain specifically for pain you can see here okay that of these people the predominant people had some improvement right in pain and this is all comers of pain right most of them can you imagine three like maybe a third of the patients had a significant improvement in their pain so you're talking like at least a 75 reduction and when you look at the dose it's an average of 25 to 50 milligrams per day 76 of our patients had an improvement within the first month this is actually improving as we get more data and we can be a bit more aggressive in our dosing um 82 right 82 had some improvement at the three-month mark right and the reason for this is because we can we can titrate the or or help the patients adjust their medications or their their um their yeah their medication um as we see them in follow-up and you look at this the average pain and this is pain again all cameras not just parkinson's patients so all comer pain their average pain that they said that they quantified was 7.4 out of 10 so it's pretty significant pain 7.4 out of 10 is pretty significant and the pain reduced by almost 48 by almost half okay so this goes down to about three point eight okay and again fourteen percent of patients improved by more than eighty percent when you look at these numbers this is this is comparable to the opiates okay except that we know that opiates have other issues like addiction um dr lim we have a question if you are up first something um there's a question here are there any issues with interactions with other parkinson's disease medications great question so and i'm going to touch on that a little later but i will answer it as well now the answer is is that cannabis does or cbd and thc they do interact or they can interact with medications now specifically to parkinson medications the answer is it depends because parkinson's medications like i like i had mentioned earlier isn't just one thing will it interfere with cinematic dance or carbidova the answer is no but will it interfere with some of the other antipsychotics or antidepressants that you may be con on as well the answer is yes will it be uh will it interfere with or interact with benzodiazepines which some parkinson's patients are on for instance for sleep the answer is yes and so it's important and we've realized this to have a team manage your care okay so you know i'll be the first to admit even with all my training i am not a drug expert okay um you know there's just too much to know but pharmacists i mean that's their job they are drug experts so that's why we have clinical pharmacists on our team to review all of our patients to make sure that there are no drug interactions so kind of a long-winded way to answer it but yes the answer the short answer is yes it can interfere with parkinson's drugs or inner interact we do have another one here does the dose include thc so yes so these doses are 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd okay i should have been more clear here sorry 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd and there is a little bit of thc and usually the doses of our thc are in the one to two milligrams and the reason for the thc is mostly mostly because none of the none of the cbd that we get in canada is hemp derived which means that there is always some amount of thc in our cbd now i will say that actually this may be a good thing because thc is really it's often needed for cbd to act better or to be more effective so a little bit of thc with more cbd actually is better but this is a cbd only dose this is just for cbd okay so let's look at the tremor so this one we don't have as much data and you can see that the numbers aren't very much but there are there is some improvement okay and so some improvement in our in our uh in our tremor patients uh just because the reason that our numbers aren't very high is most of the patients who are being referred to our clinic is for pain and anxiety and so um again most people experience some improvement and again a significant improvement in tremors um and the dose again about 25 milligrams per day is on average what these patients were uh had effect on so what about insomnia more data right so this is for people uh who have trouble sleeping average dose 26 milligrams per day again of cbd thc also has a huge benefit but we use it more cautiously especially in our parkinson patients because there is a risk of of uh hallucinations with with uh with or uh hallucinations or cognitive issues with um with thc and so we tend to use it cautiously i will tell the attendees here that cbd actually counters the effects of thc so if you have a predominant cbd like let's say you're on 50 milligrams a day of cbd adding say 5 or 10 milligrams of thc is not the same effect as going on no cbd and just taking 5 or 10 milligrams of thc okay so cbd actually directly counteracts the effects of thc and so you can see here that cannabis in both cbd and thc together can be hugely um [Music] effective at treating insomnia right so again you look i mean you know yes a significant number of people didn't find any benefit that's okay right but a great majority of people had significant improvement okay 83 at three months and then anxiety all right so when you look at anxiety um also a lot of people improve okay so 87 over three months average dose about 27 milligrams this is again predominantly cbd not very much thc at all because we know that long-term consequences of thc actually may worsen depression and anxiety um so this is uh you know the point that i'm showing this is really just to show everyone that you know the clinic is a data driven and b we are having data right um you can see here that not very many people get worse right all of these things very little people get worse and so it's safe and it's potentially very effective okay so um are there risks to taking cannabis and the answer is is yes right so there are side effects to cannabis thc i usually break them down into two thc is what we're mostly you know what we hear in the public um that's the stuff that makes people high it make you know so obviously it's side effect or not necessarily a side effect to some people who want it right it makes them high it makes them drowsy this is why it can be helpful in people with insomnia it can make people have um balance issues so they feel a little bit unsteady on their feet which can again we use this cautiously in parkinson patients because parkinson's patients tend to have stability and mobility issues already so we use this cautiously it can lead to dizziness again the same reason that we use it consciously because we don't want to make any of the the uh mobility issue in parkinson's patients even worse palpitations uh dry mouth um [Music] and so uh again and these things right hallucinations and worsening of anxiety and so we use thc very strategically and very cautiously in our parkinson's patients and usually only when there are on much larger doses of cbd so what's the side effects of cbd you know quite literally not very much there are some patients of ours who who report some loose stools or diarrhea i'm actually more convinced from a clinical standpoint that the loose stool and diarrhea is not so much from the cbd itself but rather the oil so the oil that we're using is an mct oil so um a medium chain triglyceride and some people you know if you take oil it's a bit it gives people kind of makes people a little bit gassy and gives people loose stools and i think that's probably more of what the what the issues are from rather than from the cbd but it's it is something that we notice um some people if they take it for insomnia some people get the the reverse they feel like they're totally energized that's rare but we've seen it um and there are some people who develop some lightheadedness or dizziness but we think in our clinic it's probably more to do with the fact that our cbd here in canada always contains some thc and there are some people who are just very sensitive to thc addictions is there an addictions risk so thc there is an addictions risk but you can see it is extremely small so just to show you uh on the line so this line up here is nicotine we know that nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs out there so this is smoking this is why smokers have a really hard time stopping and then you look here this black is alcohol okay we know that our societies have problems with alcohol consumption but for the most part most people don't get addicted to alcohol but you can see that it's got a significant cocaine is actually right up there not that addictive cocaine just as much as alcohol but you look at thc and look at it and this is a logarithmic scale so this is this is like this is orders of magnitude smaller and so you see that it's not a zero right but it's really small okay is there any addictions raised to cbd the answer is long-term we don't know but it doesn't look like it from a clinical standpoint um there are no there's no uh documented withdrawal symptoms so if you stop people are always worried okay if i stop my medication do i get worse in actual fact we found some really remarkable things with cbd whereby as we escalate the doses of cbd and our patients respond what actually they can do is once they reach a clinical response they stay there for like three months and then some of them for financial reasons usually they stop or they don't take it as often and they realize actually that the benefits are still there and so it's not something that i can necessarily explain except for maybe physiologically your body up regulates the receptors and it gets more efficient at this but i have patients who for instance take cbd for pain and after three months you know they would take it every day or twice a day and then after three months they would take it once every third day or you know once a week or twice a week so it's really very surprising with good control and then there are some um there are some studies out there that suggest okay maybe cbd actually can help with other addictions like you know for cocaine addiction or opiate addiction um i have a couple questions here of course sorry to interject again um is cdb obtained by prescription only yes so right here yeah so it's going to be right here so the answer is no um you don't you don't have to get um cbd through a prescription now i will say this though i'd like to think you know we're two years from the legalization of cannabis in canada and yet despite that believe it or not there is still a lot of grey market stores out there they're decreasing but they're still there and a lot of them have fled to online so i have still believe it or not there are patients of mine who order cbd because a friend told them to order from the site and the site is an unregulated site sorry an unregulated product site they're not they're not health canada approved and so they're selling gray market products and you know the fact of the matter is when i ask my patients it's the same price as the regulator product so i'm not really sure why one would go besides the fact that one may not unders may not realize that that's a great market site and so the best thing to do is if you're looking for it um you know go to a government regulated retail store you can go on the bc website and find out which stores are uh have a license and you can also find out which companies are are licensed through the bcbc government website um so hopefully that answers that question do you want to ask the next question alana first before i go into this sure some really good questions here a couple more can you recommend some strains brands where to buy doctors who we can talk to do you see patients yourself and prescribe cannabis it's a great question and i'm going to answer all of those as we go through i i promise okay um the next one is actually about cbd so maybe you want to answer that one cbd cbd isolate versus full spectrum cbd great question great question so cbd isolates are some companies out there that um that will sell you a cbd isolate um and so the the evidence for the difference between the two isn't great but i can tell you that clinically and from a theoretical and physiologic standpoint full spectrum is probably better and the reason is is that full spectrum allows more synergy so there's this phenomenon called the entourage effect that suggests that in combination the minor cannabinoids or all the cannabinoids act together and the terpenes to provide a more complete response rather than a single pointed response also there is some ancillary evidence to suggest that cbd isolates may not act as well because you'll need higher doses so for instance there's a there's a product on the market for seizures called epidialex epidialex is uh used in the treatment of childhood seizures that's all that it's really approved for certain childhood sweeteners and it's 99 cbd now you know you talk to the company and they'll say that it's a full spectrum but the fact is is that it's 99 cbd so it's actually really close to an iceland um even though it has the other things now if you look at the doses of epidialex for treatment of seizures you're looking at between 800 to 1500 milligrams that's a lot so if anybody has ever purchased cbd you'll know that a usual standard 40 ml bottle of 25 milligrams that's usually a standard is a thousand milligrams and so when you look at the epidiolex to treat childhood seizures you're looking at consuming one entire bottle twice a day right so it's a lot um and so it's a bit anecdotal so i can't don't go don't quote me saying that isolates are are not as effective because we don't know but based on all the information out there and try to gather everything um and putting it all together my sis my my opinion my medical opinion only is that the full spectrum is more efficacious or acts more or acts better or more effectively than the isolates and one more question yes um perhaps you can comment on this uh my doctor and neurologist told me there is no real proof that cbd works well that's so so i can say that unfortunately a lot of my colleagues continue to say things like this when it's not true and i've been trying to single-handedly speak to all of my colleagues across bc and across canada about this first of all um you know if they ever say things like that you can tell them about the phase three trial for the epidialettes that i just mentioned so that's medical cannabis epidialex is the is the cbd uh for childhood seizures that has phase three trials so um to not get too technical phase 3 trials where you get this randomized double-blind control trials is the gold standard for evidence and there is phase 3 trials for epidialex in childhood seizures and so there is lots of emerging evidence to say that cbd is useful a lot of the neurologists and a lot of the gps they just they say that because they don't know and so what i've been trying to say is that instead of saying no why don't we co-manage the patient through for instance through perceive md and then we can all learn together right and so that's what we'll be doing so for instance a lot of the um a lot of the physicians the ep the neurologists who did epilepsy at vancouver general hospital they didn't know anything about medical cannabis but their patients were all on it so what did they do is that we work now directly with them so we see all of their patients who are on medical cannabis uh or who are on cannabis and also happen to have epilepsy so now we share their patients and we manage the cannabis side and they manage the epilepsy side they're the pharmaceutical epilepsy side and we work together as a team so i think that that's a much better approach than saying nope there's no evidence don't go and try it okay so if that's all uh for now i'm gonna answer some of those other questions that were asked um but here so i think this is one of the questions i was asked should i just go get my canvas from a store and just try it out myself right because everything is legal i can just go to the store now i will tell you this going to the store and getting it from a medical uh prescription exactly the same product okay i don't want you to think that the store has sub has um has products that are inferior to the medical realm it's not it's exactly the same so you say okay well why don't i just go to the store to buy it well there's a few reasons one is that it's always better to get a medical practitioner involved if you're really trying to treat a medical problem right that's my fee that's my that's my stance on everything i mean if you have diabetes and you're trying to treat diabetes with your diet you should really try to employ the the help of a dietician so that you can do it properly and so that's one thing the second is that um in the medical route you you can get uh compassion pricing so if your income is below a certain level a lot of like perceive md for instance can help you register with uh with a producer that can get you a discount whereas if you go to a retail shop they're not going to give you any discount you just pay a retail price the third is in regards to pricing as well when you get a medical document for your for your cannabis um you can write it off on your taxes because now you get a medical prescription it becomes a medical um uh it's prescribed by by a physician so it becomes a medical expense so you can write it off on your taxes and some of the third party plans um are covering it okay um so those are the reasons the the and and you know it's it's here as well so the no medical supervision do you really want to just go and buy from a retail store and then try to dose it yourself you know if you're getting side effects who do you ask if there's drug interactions which we already know there are who do you go to right so those are the reasons that i usually give patients say hey like why would you go try to do this on your own when you clearly have um you know a medical condition for it why don't you employ um the services of of a practitioner now i will also say right now that all of our services are free okay so i don't want people to go out there and say well i would employ a medical service but if i could afford it but i don't have any money all of our services are covered under msp so as long as you are you know you you have provincial coverage you will not pay anything to get our services i mean obviously you'll have to pay for the product because we don't control that but our services you know you see a pharmacist you see a nurse you see a doctor all free how much is a cost this is another one of those questions that i always get okay so in general it's about i would say on average about nine or ten cents per milligram so if you're on 50 milligrams a day you're you're about five dollars okay um and a capsule they've come and come down in price about the same so you know if you're on 20 milligrams a day for instance you're spending two dollars a day okay so in a month that's about sixty dollars a thousand milligram bottle is about ninety dollars and depending on how how much your dosing is right um some people can get away with ours we have some patients who use 90 dollars every two months and some patients who use 90 every 20 days okay um and so you can see that again there are there are benefits right if you're spending you know 145 or 135 dollars a month it's you know and you and you'll be eligible for for instance compassion pricing and you get 20 percent off or 15 off and you get a tax deductible i mean it adds up right um this is the question that was asked okay so how do you get to be seen so we uh you can just have your gp refer to us okay um and i can give alana all of the referral information we can we even have a referral sheet that the physician just fills out and signs and then sends to us so we are a referral only clinic but again we are 100 covered by msp um we require referral either from a gp or your neurologist or any other doctor and what's the benefits of seeing us well you see a pharmacist to make sure that there are no drug interactions that we need to be careful about you see a nurse that can help with your intake and answer any questions you see a doctor who can also help and then you see an educator or a coach that can help you that can help you register with a licensed producer help you register for compassion pricing uh help you find help you place your first order and then you know once you get your product and it comes for instance in a bottle and you look at it and you're like i have no idea how to take this the educator can walk you through like okay this is how you take it and now we're doing everything virtually so you could just do it from the comfort of your home we use um a virtual care platform called ollo health that we can you know connect with you on by video or by phone and then we can help you through and this is what we help you with right okay so dosing side effects drug interactions education so that's it so this is the this is the uh the uh website for um perceive md this is our phone number in case you want to call us um yeah or you could just email us okay and again alana i'll give elena the whole package of what we need what you need to get a hold of us um some more questions here um can i ask for a prescription from my family doctor absolutely so yes any doctor can can fill out a prescription if your family physician or your physician is not has never prescribed cannabis before i can tell you that they're probably going to say no and the reason they're going to say no is because to prescribe cannabis is not the same as prescribing any other drug it's really health canada has really bungled it up and it's and it's quite it's it's not necessarily complicated but it's very different than their usual practice and so um yeah but if they've prescribed it by all means yes they can prescribe it and if you want they can send it over to us and then we can we can take that medical document and submit it on your behalf and help you and you know so you can use any part of our service right so if you say okay i only want to use your educator service you can have your family doctor um send us the medical document and we can we can send it to one of the licensed producers on your behalf and we can help you educate and we can help you apply for compassion pricing all that stuff that i suspect their office wouldn't want or wouldn't necessarily offer you and i'm not sure about this question if i'm reading it properly do you take pt from usa and cost i'm not sure what the pt means products maybe do we take products from the usa uh maybe guest 879 can you elaborate patient patient maybe oh do we take patients from the u.s um maybe maybe that's what it's saying so we can we can take private patients um [Music] yes uh and we can uh but it would have to be private paid because they wouldn't be they would no longer fall under the bc uh provincial coverage if you're from out of province we it would have to be private pay again mostly because the provinces don't have an agreement with each other for medical cannabis and for virtual if you're from the us it becomes a challenge because then we have to we have to um recommend the product that you have to go look for in the us which doesn't sound hard but the difference between canada and the us is in terms of regulations so um in canada the the federal government and health canada has mandated that all the licensed producers be uh regulated which means that they control you know things like dosing there has to be certain uh criteria for quality and for consistency of the label so if it says like 25 milligrams per mil that there is about 25 milligrams per mil in there so it's like accurate packaging in the u.s those regulations don't exist which means that the package can be anything and it could be completely different what's inside the package and so it's unfortunate which means that in the u.s you could have a much more variable response all right thank you um another question does cannabis help with dopamine levels the answer is no so cbd can affect things like your serotonin and your dopamine and your norepinephrine receptors but cannabis in and of itself does not increase your dopamine okay so now that's not to say that the it doesn't help with the parkinson tremor okay so you just remember that the parkinson tremor is there because of dopamine uh nerve cells have died or have been injured and they therefore can't act on subsequent uh nerves so it's like one nerve here that's dopamine releasing that acts on this nerve and this stops working so this nerve doesn't work normally okay but this nerve can be regulated directly by cbd okay so for instance if it's a hyperactive nerve it can be attenuated so it's less active just like dopamine would but it's not dopamine whereas cinnamon and the other dopamine agonist actually go in and give the body more dopamine which does the same thing to this to this nerve okay so it's called the different nerve okay and can we get a free consultation an initial consultation yes like i mentioned everything is free except for the products again we i don't control that but the whole assessment um this whole thing about perceive mb is free if we get referred to perceive is the consultation virtual yes yes we have moved to virtual for covid and also to better serve our patients um and also we realize that a lot of our patients they have mobility issues so being seen at home is better um yeah so for those reasons we've decided to go completely virtual um i don't see any more questions in the chat box but i have a question of course um so you know i think many neurologists might be cautious in recommending cannabis use and do you think this has something to do with the concern about the hallucinogenic effects or do you attribute it to something else and is there a high risk for hallucinogenic effects uh for people with pd or or does it just vary from person to person it's a good question so uh off the bat it definitely varies from person to person but the issue really how with neurologists or actually any physician who doesn't consider or won't consider recommending or or trying cannabis is really their own biases and no matter what i think sometimes um people may forget that physicians are human so they're just as human as anybody else we're we're not superheroes which is to say that there is inherent like we live our lives and we still get biased by things around us so you know if people or physicians have uh a son or a daughter who got addicted to cannabis or a friend's friend who got addicted to cannabis or they deal with addictions medicine themselves and they see people addicted to cannabis that they would say no this is not a drug but my argument for uh to that would be the opiates look at the opiate crisis that we're in right now okay it's a terrible crisis people die more people die from opioid overdose than from kovit but i would challenge any person to undergo major surgery without opiates no one would do it it's inhumane okay so the point being that cannabis just because cannabis has been abused it doesn't mean that it has no medicinal benefits because it does and so the problem is is that people tend to bring their own biases into their practice because we're just human and there isn't great there isn't great evidence yet but i can tell you that lots of things that we do in medicine don't have great evidence okay i'm sure that i'll uh some people here i'm certain of it must have been given gabapentin as a prescription drug in the past now i would challenge any of you to ask your physicians to show you what the evidence for gabapentin is and i can tell you that it's quite bad same with the opiates not great evidence for chronic pain use but we do it same with surgeries most surgeries have no good evidence that they work but we do it what i'm trying to say is i'm not saying that surgery is bad or that the opinion is i'm just organ pendant is bad or that opiates are bad i'm just trying to say that there are lots of things in medicine that we do that doesn't have great evidence because we learned over time that it works okay when your appendix bursts and we have to go remove it there's no evidence for that right no one did a trial to say okay if we didn't remove it versus if we did remove it do you die because you wouldn't be able to do that study but surgeons will remove that appendix that's all that's all i really have to say about that sure that's understandable you know i think that oh sorry just one other thing i just wanted to say because there was another point that you made there um that i didn't answer which is the other thing this is that most physicians think of cannabis as thc and so yes and i already mentioned it i am very cautious about giving my cannabis patients thc okay about giving my pd patients thc because a if they already have imbalance issue or dizziness at baseline and i gave them a whole bunch of thc and it just made it worse they're gonna fall and they're gonna break a hip and i'm gonna make them worse so for sure do i want my parkinson's patients high no usually not right but there are some instances actually when the disease is so debilitating that maybe getting a little escape from the reality of the terminal illness is actually a benefit but cbd on the other hand isn't doesn't have these issues right and so that's the problem is that a lot of the people when they when you ask them with medical cannabis they think oh you're going to smoke it and you're going to be thc it's really very far from what we do at the clinic yeah i was just going to say yeah that's understandable on the one hand despite its legalization for sure there is some stigma that is still attached to it and perhaps a misunderstanding between cbd and thc so i think when people think of marijuana they think of being high which is really attributed to thc um and a couple more questions here as well does cannabis help with stiffness so the rigidity i'm pro i think that question is probably referring to the rigidity that parkinson's patients feel where it's almost like things get stuck and the answer is is maybe and i don't know the answer necessarily because we don't we don't have good evidence for it and the reason that i say is maybe is because when you physiologically what causes the stiffness or the rigidity in parkinson's patients it's actually not to do with their muscles it's to do with their nerves okay it's the damage in their nerves that cause the sort of cog wheeling okay and that cog wheeling is if you can fix the nerves um the with cbd you can i guess theoretically or physiologically improve that rigidity now if it's strictly a muscle rigidity because there are some rigidity or stiffness from the muscles itself i don't know right there is some suggestion though that cbd is anti-inflammatory so if it's from inflammation then the answer is maybe it does help um but yeah i don't know the answer for sure okay great another question if my doctor or neurologist refuses to refer what do we do so you know if you try um and you really can't get referred uh we can you know we recommend usually like a walk-in clinic okay um to get a referral and if you really can't we have a no refusal policy all right and perhaps you can comment on this comment my mom was on gabapentin for years and it didn't do anything yes i saw that comment actually it's uh it's like what i said right the elements were kevin pence and it just sort of made me laugh when i saw it because uh i know lots of people like this and um and this is exactly one of those things we give things in medicine all the time based on what someone else may have told us and we've never really looked up the evidence and there's no evidence for it that's why gabapentin doesn't do anything does cbd help with pain yes and so that's why i put the slide up again to show you that it does help with pain your own you're looking at almost a 50 reduction and this is a really good question here how about patients already having hallucinations yes great question so in patients already having hallucinations i would certainly um opt for minimal thc which means that again like another reason not to just go to the to the retail store to get this different companies have varying amounts of thc in them so even though the bottle may say let's say 25 milligrams per ml of cbd the amount of thc in there is varies from accompanying the company some people have like 0.8 or 0.4 milligrams per mill and some people go all the way up to one or two milligrams per mil of thc and so if someone already has hallucinations our team would be very certain um to make sure we choose a product for the patient that has the lowest amount of thc in it um and this and and just mostly cbd uh and the cbd can actually potentially help with some of the hallucinations we have time for a couple more questions do you have patients who take is that patient yes so there are yes so i mean you know we've seen i want to say probably like 2700 patients now so you can imagine that we've seen just about every drug out there in terms of combination uh and so yes we have many patients on quotations it's a pretty common drug um and that's why our pharmacists work directly with the patient and the physician to make sure that okay if we're gonna start and there's a potential interaction these are what to look out for and that's why we see our patients regularly in follow-up so unlike you know some other clinics you know that may say okay here's your prescription for six months go away we make sure that we see we see our patients regularly because i mean it's a journey it's a journey that we go along with the patient okay and one more question here what would be or two more questions what would be the best time of the day to take cbd so there's no real best time to take cbd um it really depends so there are some patients that we have for instance that have predominantly insomnia issues and so we tell them to take it at night you know a few hours before they sleep but there are but but sometimes and it lasts the whole day the next day so it really depends on the person and that's something something that we usually try to help the patients figure out um usually the oral oil or capsule lasts for about eight to twelve hours okay and so you know it depends if you're trying to to help with the tremors in the daytime you may take you know twice a day in the daytime and at night or if you're mostly for tremors and it only bothers you in the daytime maybe you're just taking a daytime and not at night all right and what does oh sorry does thc build up or accumulate in your body so the answer is yes thc and cbd probably do accumulate um they're very lipophilic so they do probably stay in fat um but does that mean that you get addicted or does that mean that you actually get tolerant um and the answer is is we don't know there's some suggestion in the literature when you look at the addiction studies that um that people who use like a lot and i'm talking like a lot like 5 grams 5 to 10 grams a day that they do get withdrawal symptoms but 5 to 10 grams a day is is a i can't i mean for a lot of people they may not realize how much that is but that's an astronomical amount okay i think we have time for one last question here um uh two more questions then and i think that we can wrap it up here um i love that you guys have these really great questions thank you it makes for a better presentation i agree when we have that dialogue um how do we decrease drowsiness in the morning when taken at night for insomnia good question so you can either try to take it earlier in the evening so that its effects are not lasting as long so for instance if you're taking it two hours before bedtime and then you're finding it that it does help you sleep but in the morning when you get up it's you still feel drowsy or a bit groggy for a remaining two hours then you may push the dose back uh to take it two hours earlier at night or you can reduce the dose and the last question if using cbd should i stay away from alcohol i mean in general unless one is consuming a copious amount of alcohol probably not i mean if you're drinking you know one to two glasses of wine for instance a day is fine you know if you're drinking you know half a bottle of wine a day then that's a problem but it's not really a problem so much with the cbd because they tend not to necessarily interact it's more problem with the alcohol consumption and the fact that you're going to get drowsy okay great i think we can wrap things up now uh it's a little past two o'clock dr lam i want to thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to deliver such an informative presentation for our pd community it really was great and i also want to thank everyone for your great questions um and i'm happy to pass

show us how to make a perfect infused cream known as style because Nonna is such a pioneer in the cannabis cooking world I wanted to make her pastry cream what we have is two cups milk quarter teaspoon salt four tablespoons of cornstarch 115 grams of sugar we're going to take the cornstarch and we're going to swap it into the sugar a healthy pinch of salt going into the corn stretch whisk it together so we get a nice even blend we're in a separate commit you can either use two full egg I like a really rich deluxe taste pastry cream so I use four egg yolks instead of two whole eggs either work you're just going to districts get a different consistency for the pastry cream so we're going to take our four egg yolks we're going to take the sugar in the cornstarch and we're going to make mix it into the edges we have two cups of milk I'm just going to put it in a saucepan together with the vanilla beans so we're going to heat it up and so it's going to mix those vanilla beans in and pop it on the stove hot hot cream we're just going to slowly ladle some pastry came in to the eggs and what that does is the eggs slowly cooks evenly and you get a nice smooth put it and then we'll put it back into the saucepan and cook it until it boils we just want these like big bubbles like that so this is done we're going to put this through a clip just kind of make sure that if there are lumps in there we're taking them out so put it in there and you see the flecks of vanilla how pretty that is we're not done yet we're going to cool this down and then we'll add our weed butter to it you want to stir this every once in a while to make sure you don't get a film on the top of it as it cools down last step of our cannabis pastry cream so you got to put the canvases we have some note of style cannabutter that we made some scratch and we're going to add it to our pastry cream to give it that little extra kick [Music] this is where our pastry cream that looks really good put it in a pastry bag [Music] Thank You cream done [Music]", "rIPTxn7FNak": "[Music] what's up thank you for tuning into the canon guide today we got a really cool review for you make sure you like this video and subscribe so we can get more content to more people we got a really cool review we're gonna do a CVD topical self review cell boards artisanal self now we've been carrying this salad for a long time I my collective here you can see that product right there it is a coconut oil base pure CBD derived from 100% cannabis flowers now this is a very high dose CBD product especially for topical in the entire tin I believe is about 400 milligrams of CBD that they list there on the top and they do come in different strains mainly ACDC and Charlotte's Web I wish I had the you know original full tin it usually comes in a kind of the large silver tin and that can run I think it usually runs around $40 in the dispensary depending on the area of coverage that you need to cover can be less or more you know of a value for you oh it's kind of nice system support a small business it's not one of a you know very large conglomerate yeah so when you smell this it is essentially is unscented there's no aromatherapy oils or anything else in here to you know make it very fragrant it is just raw like smells like coconut oil really just really smell like cannabis at all but when you you know it is filled with cannabis when you use it the past couple of days my knee has just been totally inflamed I hadn't been able to walk on it properly and it was seriously just thrown pain just sitting here you know most most people would just take an Advil or Tylenol but this stuff's really bad for your liver so I opted to try out the topical CBD you see how that you know really helped my my knee injury the coconut oil is a little bit thicker sometimes you can almost seem like a solid at first but when you touch it it actually just kind of melts into a liquid oil right there and your finger yeah look at it just melts right into an oil just with the heat of your your skin aren't there a little bit does go a long way with this but I found you know for males so you might actually need more than if you're a female just because have a bunch of hair the hair end up absorbing a bunch of it so I kind of had to use more than I you know I think someone less like hair we'd have to use so I just kind of got a solid glob on there now almost my my top part of my knee was hurting like right above the kneecap so I went ahead got it on both sides of that as well as on top and around the kneecap and just rubbed it in nice and gently now rub me I didn't was a little bit you know sore if you have a really sort area it's again I heard two rubbed in so just you know you can be gentle with it and I believe it is best to do this at night now I use it throughout the day you can use it throughout the day it doesn't actually get you high or medicated but at night when you're sleeping your skin temperature increases and that's when you're gonna be doing most your healing so it's gonna really be most beneficial and you know be a little bit more receptive I feel at nighttime or early morning or maybe even after a shower when you're you know nice and warm then I would take a little bit more I would actually just essentially just coat the entire area and sometimes if you can find like a source or you know find where the paint's traveling from I've actually hit that area with a little bit as well and what I found although I was very skeptical at first because you don't think you know topical is gonna work because it seems like just a lotion but it really really took the edge off now it didn't completely take the pain away when I was active and trying to move on it and you know not doing good things probably but you know when I was just sitting here you know trying to be comfortable and rest it very very very much helped the just ambient pain and just you know just the pain that's radiating and pulsating when you're just trying to relax you know conditions vary and it's really hard to say this will work for you this will work for your condition but I would definitely give it a try there's a lot of different brands out there make sure you find cvd that's derived from marijuana flower not CBD isolate from hemp it has anecdotally been found to be much less effective the have CBD isolate why that is you know a lot of people can just say it's entourage effect or it's the terpenes and the cannabis plant maybe it's the miniscule amounts of THC or the other cannabinoids we don't really know for sure I found that I much prefer those products I found them to be much more effective and if I'm to be just more reputable their testing results tend to come from reputable sources within the state and they tend to have testing sources man I can do a whole video and that you know what I will I'm gonna do a whole video on CBD just misinformation because it's seriously my pet peeve CBD isolates that are just found in a wellness store that's advertising CBD is not going to be a quality CBD product yeah people might might hate that but just be very aware when you're looking for CBD online be very skeptical until you have you know less reasons to be just be skeptical of CBT online especially from dispensaries still be skeptical just make sure you do your research look into it know what your product contains yeah supports been some great people lab test is 100% flower bud ACDC CBD topical great stuff alright so sub Ward's artisan South find them

very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub

does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music]

love it next to the grow house since Jason Cranford pharmaceutical grade lab where he and his staff turned those plants into cannabis oil it's all really all about keeping the medicine clean so this is actual raw plant material this is how it looks when we first started out it's probably 20 pounds somewhere on there and how many of these do you have height 50 the medicine that you're that you've sort of devised for autism is it based only on this plant it'll be really easy for us to mix like a whole bunch of THC strains together that makes them CBD oil and do this to do that but the problem with that is consistency within batches if I give Eric a bottle today and then I give her a bottle a year from now it has pulled from the straight same plant then the lab report is you're gonna be the same so her product will be consistent and so what's in this what are we looking at here this is a strain that is very very low in CBD and high in THC what's a call I haven't named it yet THC has been shown to help with autism related symptoms easing chronic pain reducing insomnia and promoting appetite for wasting syndrome but it's also the psychoactive compound meaning this medicine will get kids high so what happens next like it's a plant how does it become a medicine all right I can't get my hands out of here [Laughter] [Music]", "6TWt_QNtiW4": "welcome to another episode of demystifying medicine marijuana also known as cannabis ganja weed and pot is an annual flowering plant it is a psychoactive drug that can be used for recreational and medical purposes there are over 500 chemicals in the marijuana plant but the most commonly known ones being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD the legality of cannabis differs per country many countries have adopted decriminalization laws to make possessions easier while other countries enforce stricter punishments the countries that have legalized are Canada Georgia South Africa arrghh way and eleven of the United States more areas have legalized the medical use even with the rise and acceptance and usage within the recent years there are so many common misconceptions with the two most well-known being that marijuana is a gateway drug and that it kills brain cells in a 2017 study it was found that 123 million Americans use marijuana while 5.3 use heroin assuming that all heroin users were pot smokers this would result in a value of 4.3% showing a weak correlation thus undefined not biological but more sociological furthermore there is no evidence to support the claim that marijuana has neurotoxic effects however it has been shown to cause short-term memory loss similar to that of drinking alcohol the studies in these regards have been inconclusive with some showing detrimental effects while others show protection against damages caused by Alzheimer's and Parkinson's medical marijuana is the use of the cannabis plant or its compounds to treat diseases and conditions it has been shown to be effective in a host of illnesses and in particular chronic pain and fiber the Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 50 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain this condition is characterized that pain that lasts three to six months or more and has effects on everyday life and mental health a 20-17 study in the Journal of Health Affairs found that the majority are sixty two percent of medical marijuana usages are for chronic pain and these conditions have substantial or conclusive evidence of cannabis being an effective treatment Friday myalgia is defined as widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue insomnia memory loss and mood swings in fibromyalgia the brain intensifies the signals resulting in a greater perception of pain although idiopathic in nature it can be onset by genetics infections of trauma or stress with symptoms increasing over time cannabis works through blocking spinal peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms that promote pain in blocking these sensors the perception of pain is decreased or halted they use the underlying biological and physiological pathways to disrupt pain relieving symptoms although most studies focus on marijuana and the effects of pain relief as a whole there are a few that looks specifically at fibromyalgia and a 2011 study it was found that 43 percent of patients reported strong pain relief 43 percent mild pain relief and the remaining seven no changes in the 2014 study by the National Pain Foundation it was found that 62 percent reported cannabis is very effective 33 is helpful and five percent sever had absolutely no effects a 2018 study published in The Lancet showed that cannabis was effective in both lowering pain levels and weaning off other medications another 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology showed that cannabis had significant favorable outcomes in all tested categories I wish I had received this treatment when I was first diagnosed I returned to who I was before and I regained my health are some of the testimonials there are many other treatments that can be used in the case of chronic pain among them non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs opioids epidural steroid injections sympathetic blockers over-the-counter prescriptions and therapy the other most used treatment method is opioids which are a group of medications derived from the opium poppy they're controversial showing a variety of positive and negative effects the positive effects of opioids are attributed to you fork feeling relieving the sensory and emotional aspects of pain however the negative effects of addiction reinforcement and dependency also persist the CDC and 2016 created 12 guidelines to make opioids safer three notable recommendations are non opioid therapy is preferred clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage and status of the patient should be re-evaluated every three months in a 2018 study done by the Institute University did you not see them illegal it was found that it takes one week for someone to become addicted resulting in over 3,900 deaths in 2017 which was 50% more than car accidents

you", "xAW6oB6E4fQ": "hey everyone I'm Shireen kasam the founder of my pain center calm the number one CVD resource for you to try and buy CBD okay what I want to talk to you about today is I get a lot of questions Shireen there's so many different CBD balms and muscle relaxants or muscle lotions out there which one should I get and that is true there are so many different types of CD CBD bombs out there that you have to make sure you pick the right one because you could spend 30 50 60 dollars on something that's not gonna work for you so how do you know what's the right one well one do your research and you can research all the products at my pain center calm we kind of break down what to look for in a product and what are the top things that our products have to check how much CBD is in the bottle and what's the size of the bottle so let's we're gonna get into that in a minute and then third just make sure that the the product has a certificate of analysis make sure that it's the correct amount of CBD that they're selling to you make sure it's not fake you know like a lot of people can now just put CBD stickers on their products so make sure you're buying your product from a reliable source such as my pain center calm we've spent over ten thousand dollars trying CBD products to make sure that we sell products to you that we really believe in that we actually use so like my mom has arthritis I have sciatica my dad has a torn rotator cuff as well as herniated discs my boyfriend is a firefighter so he's always sore and in pain and so we've only used we are only suggesting products to you that we truly truly believe in one of our favorite products is this green rose product is a muscle and joint and relief cream now here's what I was talking about about size okay this is a 1 ounce jar this whole thing is 1 ounce and there's a hundred and 15 milligrams of CBD in it that means the whole thing has 150 milligrams of CBD not every time you use it is it 150 milligrams of CBD so when I say it's a hundred and fifty milligrams per 1 ounce that is the same thing as somebody saying this jar has 300 milligrams in it and it's 2 ounces or this jar has 450 milligrams in it but it's three ounces do you see how it's all the same so technically only the price should be going up somebody shouldn't say to you that the the jar with 300 milligrams that's 2 ounces is any stronger than this one because it's kind of it's the concentration like it's all about the concentration so this one is actually one of my favorite products my mom uses this one for her arthritis on her hands I will use this on my sciatica it's a really cool application it's just a pump so it's it's clean it's easy to use and just pump it on there another one of my favorite products is this one which is a green roach product as well it's a muscle and joint but it's got heat relief in it now this one is two hundred and fifty milligrams for three ounces so it's a little bit less CBD than this one but here are the pros about this one this one I love especially at night this is one of my go-to that night because usually like I've brushed my teeth like I've showered I'm in bed I'm ready to go to bed and then my leg starts to hurt right the flare-ups start to happen either because you're laying down on your herniated disc or now your brain is kind of it's not worried about the day-to-day things you're doing so now your brain has time to focus on the pain so what I love about this one is it's a roll-on like literally it's just a roll-on and the great thing about that is you don't have to rub it and you can if you want to but you don't have to rub it in and it's got the heat relief so if you live in if you like that that feeling of like it's working for you it's great but I love it because I can just roll it on me and go to sleep like I don't have to get back out of bed to wash my hands so I love this product this one is my favorite personally because again I don't have to dirty my hands a new product that we recently started carrying is this active fit recovery and massage gel and this is great if you work out a lot if you're an athlete if you're in the gym a lot if you're if you're just putting a lot of stress on your body and your muscles tend to hurt or you've got shin splints or just sore muscles I tend to put it on before I work out if I'm gonna have a really hard workout and then after I work out after I shower but I've started using it at night too before bed because I have been working a lot out a lot and so my muscles tend to be really tight and really sore and this is a great one because this is just a this is a tub you kind of just put your fingers in it and you take what you want and apply it and then that's it and it's got its got like a menthol cooling effect to it so I really like this product too especially if you are a gym before you're starting for me I'm starting to get back into exercising so I'm I'm really aggravating

the last episode of the mystifying medicine in this episode we will be exploring breast cancer pain reduction through the use of cannabis cannabis refers to a group of three plants with psychoactive properties known as cannabis sativa cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis these plants are made up of more than 120 components which are known as cannabinoids the main two components being cannabidiol CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol THC CBD is a chemical compound from the cannabis plant it's a naturally occurring substance that is used in products like oils and edibles to impart a feeling of relaxation and calmness unlike its cousin THC it's not a psychoactive THC is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse THC stimulate cells in the brain to release dopamine creating euphoria according to the institute it also interferes with how information is processed in the hippocampus which is the part of the brain responsible for forming new memories cancer pain is a result of late stage metastatic cancers and primary and metastatic cancers that grow in the bone for a woman with inflammatory breast cancer pain or tenderness often is one of the first symptoms pain caused by cancer itself is more common in people who have metastatic or advanced disease breast cancer starts in the cells of the wrist a malignant tumor is a group of cancer cells that can grow into and destroy nearby tissue cancer cells can spread from the breast to other parts of the body and this spread is called metastasis if breast cancer spreads it usually spreads to regional lymph nodes these are lymph nodes on the same side of the body as the tumor in the following areas under the arm around the collarbone and around the breastbone currently the single lab is investigating the host response to cancer cell release signaling molecules they are currently investigating the mechanisms associated with cancer induced pain and cancer induced depression given the application of breast cancer pain and Canada we decided to ask dr. Gurmeet Singh a professor of pathology in molecular medicine at McMaster University a couple of questions Mead saying I'm a professor of pathology and molecular medicine and a senior scientist with the Hamilton health sciences so most of my research is involved in understanding how cannabis can be used for cancer induce pain and what we found is that currently there are no good treatments for calcium use pain and it appears that cannabis especially CBD might have an effect on cannabis induced pain so we've been looking at preclinical models of breast cancer which is taking marine samples like in in rats and treating them where the with the tumor and once the animals get into pain then we give them different doses of CBD or CBD plus THC or THC alone to see if it has any effects on cancer pain and currently it appears that there is some efficacy and there seems to be some sexual dimorphism that is males seem to be reacting better than females and we're trying to understand the mechanisms by which CBD and THC affect calendar's pain it appears that the immune system might be very important in in the generation of pain and CBD is known to affect the immune system specifically the macrophages and the t-cells and thereby it may have efficacy there are some reports saying that cannabis itself might be effective in limiting tumor growth but we ourselves haven't done any of this work that work has appeared in the literature especially from a group in Israel it appears that breast cancer also involves inflammation and interactions with the immune system and if anything the biological contribution is down regulation of the immune system by cannabis and thereby protecting the individual from cancer news pain most of this pains occurs in individuals who have breast cancer that has metastasized to bone and we in our models we look at what happens to the metastasis and it appears that cannabis limits metastasis and also is able to relieve pain to some degree we haven't really tested it in humans and these are very early preclinical studies we need to do a lot more in trying to understand the mechanisms by isolating the various t-cells and also understanding what happens to the hormonal levels in these individuals my name's Robin guard I'm a PhD student in gamete sings lab I'm in my fifth year and I study cancer pain and neuropathic pain so cannabis is funny because often treatments especially treatments for cancer or sometimes for pain will come from experiments in the lab basic science and they go to preclinical experiments and then they go to clinical trials and then they use them people but cannabis is a bit backwards since it is something that was used by a lot of people and then sort of demanded to be investigated in the lab so there's many reports there's a lot of case reports that cancer works for pain there are some clinical trial reports some small ones and there's a lot of basic science between it now I mean sorry supporting it but it's all very spotty nothing is really put together and cannabis is a complicated thing there's hundreds thousands of chemicals that come out of a cannabis bud and so nobody is quite sure what which of those chemicals are responsible for having an effect if any so the steps that need to be taken are isolating the compounds of interest doing proper preclinical science on them and doing clinical trials that can be reproduced and show an effect for cancer pain so a brief overview of cancer induced pain is I mean imagine imagine a tumor it's it's a clump of dysregulated cells if it's a solid tumor growing somewhere that it ought not to grow so what we often use in the lab is a model is breast cancer is growing in the bone so imagine this this massive", "eKQgJR39ofI": "hey everyone Robert here and today I will be explaining how to dose cannabis edibles for personal use this video is intended for those who are 18 and up and caution should be exercised when using animals as well as storing them this video is designed for personal use and it's not professional advice but moreso tips and tricks I have learned myself if at any point in time you're enjoying this video feel free to hit that like button and subscribe for more content like this so the first thing that we need to cover quickly is cannabinoids there are three main cannabinoids THC CBD and terpenes THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the psychoactive part of cannabis and will cause the high most people associated with cannabis CBD or cannabidiol is the non psychoactive part of cannabis which carries well-known medical effects terpenes are responsible for the smell and flavor of cannabis and have their own effects but are non psychoactive for the most part optimally you want a combination of THC CBD and terpenes for the best experience whether for medical or recreational use otherwise known as the entourage effect in this episode I will be discussing THC for the most part but it also applies to see with the intervenes the exact same way for example if I mentioned 20% THC the same applies to 20% CBD or 20% terpenes making edibles in figuring out dosages can be challenging so I will be covering two examples of how to dose in edible the first example will be if you have lab tests in material and the second example will be if you have untested material if you live in a state like California or Colorado lab testing of cannabis products is required for retail sale this is a great way to control the safety of cannabis in regards to pesticides molds and other harmful issues but also serves as an education tool for patients and recreational users one of the issues of cannabis testing is that it is not standardized yet meaning that THC CBD and terpene tests that you're receiving may be higher or lower than the product truly contains some brands will market their total cannabinoids as the THC percentage which can throw off consumers so make sure that you read any tests you may have access to carefully to ensure that you have the right numbers so for this example I will be talking about Hades og Hades og has 20 1.07 percent THC and 0.04 percent CBD program once again this is a rough approximate not every cannabis flower has the same cannabinoids and some tests may not be accurate but we will use this as a solid approximation for our edible dosage to calculate your cannabis into milligrams of THC multiply the percentages that you have by 10 will move the decimal point one point to the right this Haidee srg for example would have approximately 210 point 7 milligrams of THC program and about 0.4 milligrams of CBD program if I were to infuse a gram with this Hades og with a cup of butter my cup of water would have approximately 211 milligrams of THC and a half a milligram of CBD if I were to infuse 10 grams of this ad 13 with a cup of butter that cup of butter would have approximately 2100 and 7 milligrams of THC and about 4 milligrams of CBD this applies to all cannabis products you have whether it is flour hash Keef wax or trim if you have a lab test a gram of shatter at 80 percent THC for example that is 800 milligrams of THC per gram in some cases you may not have access to lab testing where you may not trust the results that you were given in this case I refer to important TC percentages as follows flour is between 10 and 30 percent THC Keef is between 20 and 40 percent THC hash is between 30 and 50 percent THC and waxes between 50 and 90 percent THC on average flour is 20 percent THC Keef is 30 percent THC hash is 40 percent THC and wax is 70 percent THC these are rough approximations for each product and some products may be higher or lower than the range as I mentioned for the most part these are good starting guidelines for most medical and recreational users so for example if I had 10 grams of hash I would approximately 4000 milligrams of THC in the finished infusion 5 grams of flour would be about 1000 milligrams and 2 grams of wax would be about fourteen hundred milligrams first off I need to mention the edibles can take anywhere between twenty minutes to three hours to fully kick in and edibles definitely hit harder than your average joint or bong run if you have eaten anything else that day that will also have an effect when the adipose potency as well as a handful of other factors so it is best to start off with a low dose wait an hour then increase is necessary in the United States the suggested single dose for an adult over twenty one is between five and ten milligrams of THC this means if you make a 100 milligram edible that by a state's definition is between 10 and 20 doses of THC if you are introducing a cup of butter of THC and have a cookie recipe which calls for 1/4 cup of butter and makes 12 cookies they would aim to have 480 milligrams per cup or approximately 2.4 grams of cannabis flower that would end up producing 4 batches of 12 10 milligram cookies so you could have a few over a couple hours and being able to control the dosing safely but like most things those dosages don't apply to everyone while I certainly suggest starting off at 5 milligrams for 10 milligrams for an everyday user this would almost be micro dosing prior to legalization in California there are four main doses of edibles 100 milligrams 250 milligrams 500 milligrams and 1000 milligrams some companies offered 2.5 milligram micro dose edibles and some companies offered 10,000 milligram edibles that would leave in a weed coma for a week the reality is your dose may be anywhere between 5 milligrams and 1000 milligrams or even higher but you need to work your way up slowly 500 milligrams and 1000 milligram doses are typically considered medical doses and are great for pain and other similar ailments and were utilized quite heavily prior to recreational legalization 100 milligrams is my go to dose per cookie as I can eat more or less as I see fit just as a quick background I have been smoking every day for a few years I suggest new users start off at 5 or 10 milligrams than 550 milligrams 100 milligrams 200 milligrams between 50 milligrams 500 milligrams and then 1000 make sure to space the edibles out at least one hour in between and only bump the dosage if the last experience then give you the desired facts for example if you go and buy a 10 pack of 10 milligram edibles go home and eat one an hour later you do not feel the effects as desired so yeah another 10 milligram animal and they get it in another hour next time you should start off with a 50 milligram edible then see how you feel out for an hour before consuming a second one once again this video is a personal suggestion and should be used only as an approximate guideline for dosing edibles for personal use make sure to keep your edibles and infusions out of reach of children and exercise caution after consuming any edibles but that being said I hope everyone has a wonderful day and if you have any questions feel free to post them below", "F9_syRGcN6A": "I know you love them your host the man's the mythological creatures the legend district critter man what having a good

Scott Lipson here thank you for visiting us a pain relief org I want to go over one of my favorite products in our pain kits this is included in all of our deluxe paint kits and that is our CBD Sal glide on 450 milligrams of CBD now CBD has gained a lot of traction and momentum Langly because it has been proven effective to help people naturally get out of pain what I like about this product is it's made in the USA comes directly directly from an organic hemp farm Dona Florida which I personally have seen them grow that help themselves when you open it up it smells like cannabis if you're familiar with how that smells this is not some type of product that you could just go around the corner and pick up at your local pharmacy highly proven and organic ingredients and what I like about it is no need to massage you open it up you could put it anywhere you have your pain whether it be the neck back shoulder hip or knee and we recommend applying this three to five times a day for maximum results any questions feel free to give us a call or email thank you", "JRqt7DCQnIs": "when you sort of create a robust healthy human then you know you can tolerate more of these things that doesn't mean you should holler you should force yourself to tolerate them but right you know in many of the people that we work with you know cutting out alcohol altogether to begin with is very important but then adding some of that back in can certainly have benefits for multiple reasons can we talk about CBD and THC we both live in states where that's legal now yeah and I can tell you I first started doing CBD oil last year and just to help out with with sleep I've heard people talk about you know it's good for back pain and all this other stuff and I found the curcumin is actually way way better for back pain than the CBD oil was for me although I haven't tried the lotions and stuff like that but then also THC and edibles especially like the OL spray or like a vape pen before going to bed I found that that helps me out a little bit with sleep if I'm if I'm struggling with sleep so I know there are obvious upsides and downsides I like to get some opinions on this we asked some data we don't even need it and we were we were actually talking about this over breakfast that's the kind of guys that we are yeah so the interesting thing is that CBD on its own based on the data that's available should not help with sleep so basically when they've looked at it and they've given people CBD alone or CBD plus THC the CBD alone can actually cause alertness and it may be to do with how CBD and THC affect cortisol metabolism there's some other stuff of it you know the the signal the ways they signal you know so some people may sleep worse if they take CBD and but when you add THC then people seem to sleep better so there's like a there's a synergism there however I can say for personal experience that I've tried CBD alone before bed and it certainly seems to help it certainly does seem to help me sleep and why that is I actually I actually don't know I don't have a study to say this is why I think there's the you know there's gonna be an interaction with all the other things that are going on in the gut CBD has certainly been shown or you know to improve got information got health I don't think that's an issue for me but that's particularly animal studies and now it's been translated CBD is now being used for in cancer therapies and for epileptics and they're starting to use it in people with inflammatory bowel disease so can certainly have a number of benefits I haven't tried the CBD plus THD THC was more of a thing I did in my teenage years but but have both been shown potentially to help with sleep the the potential downsides are obviously then can interfere with cool summers harbors and all this other stuff so if it's not causing it if it's not causing you benefit then you know there's no there's potential downsides for taking it so I mean we do think you know particularly for people you know heavy marijuana users there is some risk of mental health issues if that's coming from THC or other things you know of is obviously the the strength the concentration of THC in marijuana has increased dramatically over the last few decades so there's there's multiple factors that play there if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC with 30 milligrams of CBD before bed you know you're probably well under that that risk first hold but there are studies that show that it interferes with hormone metabolism called slow metabolism so it's just it's at the moment is kind of a try it out and see if it benefits you but equally you know we roll back to our continuous message which is why aren't you sleeping in the first place right you don't want to medicate yourself to sleep you want to find out what it is it's causing your poor sleep in the first place similar to the melatonin in the apple meadow that can help but but that is a band-aid off the band-aid that you not having enough melatonin because you're exposing yourself to bright lights at night all you know it's something like that right and so I think the micro dose with are the few times where I've done edibles where I get a like oh I can't do anything else besides eat potato chips today I just I don't like the feeling and so I I tend to I tend to avoid avoid that but I also have found that the mental health thing so I have the mental health problems running my family my dad was schizophrenic my brother was schizophrenic killed himself and so I know like that's the reason I won't do psilocybin and other things because there's a potential for you know even though I think I'm well past the age at this point where those symptoms would present themselves I do notice that the couple times where I've tried that an edible that is like Oh like this is too much the next day I it's like the roller coaster there you can't have the high without the low sort of thing and the entire next day I'm just like oh wait I should be happy right now but I cannot be happy this is a thing this is a story for anything that you take to try and change the way your brain functions but what we usually say is there's no biological free lunch right you can't ask your brain to do something which you wouldn't normally do and then expect it to be completely normal after so nootropics are a classic example you know you take these compounds are supposed to increase brain cognitive function various brain functions but it might increase function in one area but it makes you less good in another area and then so maybe well I will do I'll take a nootropic usually book the only time I do is before a podcast yeah and I know in afternoons I all I have this brush yeah yeah there is a nootropic crash for me I thought maybe I was unique in that because I've never heard anyone else talk about it but no I'm certain if experience the same and there are some some nootropics that are basically just like the kitchen sink everything's in there and this sort of light switches everything on you definitely notice a difference but then you gotta come down later so I often liken it to taking MDMA where your lights switch everything on you feel great and then you know a few hours later you have this you have this big come down and it's not the same for everybody again it's something that you have to experiment with yourself but but you know again we go back to why isn't your brain functioning as you would like it to why do you feel the need to take something to enhance your brain function are there other things you could be fixing and therefore you don't need to take that it's propak in the first place you know that's always where we're gonna go back to and then if you know occasionally you need to try something like that you just need to be aware they're asking your body or brain to do something you wouldn't normally do you might gonna you're gonna pay for it later yeah from either the THC thing is not to a point where it's or at least that I feel there's any sort of psychoactive effect it it's it's like micro dosing that's like one or two milligram sort of thing and the thing that helps me with is with the sleep is it prolongs the the period where I stay asleep another thing that has really helped me and I I've had to get really sort of diligent about it and I screw up still all the time water I drink a lot of water during the day but I stop at 5:00 p.m. I stop drinking liquids of 5:00 and that way I don't feel compelled to get up at 3:30 a.m. to pee which but sometimes when that happens I get up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm like I'm up I can't get back to sleep now and so I found those two things for me in the water is probably way more helpful than the THC to be honest with you so just something to think about any other words about THC no it's not something that really interested me on the c-word site about the stuff that's free like sunshine I'm very excited about where as yeah sunshine deficiency can definitely cause insomnia so like you can fix that first before having to buy a supplement we so we the one reason why we talk about CBD is because again it might help with people with inflamed guts and we see a lot of those so we know a lot of people who feel they've benefitted from taking you for some see yeah so that's an interesting thing that you bought up recently is that maybe you have some problem that's stopping you from sleeping and then you take another thing that makes that first problem worse and maybe introduces another problem but the net effect is still positive and so your sleep does get better yeah you", "TsRh2eqB9Rc": "[Music] medical cannabis is legal in many places in the united states

are trying to use cannabis as a better alternative to antipsychotic medications that are currently used to treat aggression in patients with dementia but often come with dangerous side effects what are the differences between the two better known compounds in cannabis thc and cbd does the difference even matter thc is the main psychoactive component while cbd is primarily a relaxant thc is more potent than cbd producing the same effects with a lower dosage while the legality of thc usage is divided across state lines cbd is largely legal while thc causes temporary side effects such as slower reaction times and memory loss cbd is predominantly free of any of these effects at present researchers are trying to repurpose a cannabis drug named satifx which is an oral spray license in the u.s and the uk the drug which contains both thc and cbd was originally used for treating patients with multiple sclerosis and is now being repurposed to help treat dementia it attempts to target symptoms of agitation and aggression seen in patients with dementia the drug is designed to be a safer alternative and perhaps more effective treatment for dementia currently there's a scarcity of pharmacological treatments and some of them are rather damaging and dangerous especially in the long term so they would prescribe off-label antipsychotics for more severe cases of agitation in terms of side effects satisfaction is a relatively innocuous substance when compared to other antipsychotics it has common side effects such as increased dizziness dry mouth and risk of increased falls particularly in an elderly population even though it still has some side effects it's already a licensed drug that had gone through rigorous and objective clinical trials we already have much better awareness of what the psychological risks are overall speaking the cannabis drug with thc and cbd has therapeutic potential in a behavioral sense it may increase drowsiness which is similar to a calm and relaxed feeling but we still have to wait for the results to know whether cannabis is effective for treating dementia you", "Sfpk2w-wGNY": "this is always a joy to talk about first of all dementia because it's very close to my heart in terms of taking care of dementia patients but I'm a geriatrician so I take care of older adults and if you want to consider what my specialties are it's in long-term care dementia and end-of-life or hospice and palliative care the buck stops with me I always say is unfortunately my patients die my goal is the best quality of life all right for the duration of their life the best part and the best quality of care so I also run a geriatric fellowship program training young physicians to become geriatric physicians for all of you in here and my advice and certainly when I'm in the training process I'm training them so that they know me and how to take care of me when I get older because I'm kind of picky but also I would recommend that geriatric medicine is a lot different than primary care medicine that's internal medicine or family medicine the whole principles are quite different and actually if you look back at what's happening in our primary care medicine you see the changes that might be occurring more of a holistic approach more of a team approach more of a shared decision-making and also planning for advanced directives in terms of advanced care planning so to speak what happens if I get this this or that as I get older dealing with dementia and the primary emphasis on this particular talk is is what can we do with regards to patients who have behavioral issues with dementia patients and it's marijuana possibly a role in terms of how we might look at alternative ways how we manage these behaviors in addition there's a lot of confusion before that's all right there's a lot of confusion as far as what the hell is marijuana and I would guarantee you that if I go around I bet you I might get 10 or 15 different answers of what marijuana is and then if I bring up the term cannabis what's cannabis okay so I hate to say this but much like I had to do is I have to learn some basics so I'm going to go over some basics so that when you see something advertised CBD oil is being advertised on every street corner that you can buy it here what is it that I'm getting because then what's the difference between marijuana and CBD oil or is there a difference I don't know so so I'm going to go into some basics and then I'm going to talk to you about some of the studies with regards to the use of marijuana where we stand with regards the use of that some of the positive pros and cons if you will of it and then switch into where do we stand with regards to the use in dementia or Alzheimer's dementia before I start I want to ask how many of you are caregivers or have experience with patients who have dementia good a good portion so you'll be definitely interested in where we stand with regards to the use of cannabis if you will in our patients who have dementia the first slide up here is I have geriatrics and polypharmacy good and bad news is we're living longer the bad news is is that we have more medical problems as we grow older and therefore usually that means that we're on a lot of medicines so in Doc's particularly our specialists like to prescribe a lot of medicines because they say you can't live without them I'm on the other side and the other side of that is is that I'm looking at people who are on these drugs but are having adverse effects of those meds and you know what a lot of the drugs that we use have what they call black box warnings that means that you could die from them so it's a constant balance if you will in terms of always assessing the benefit versus the risk overall and all of us as healthcare providers is do no harm alright that's easier said than done okay and you'll see why maybe as we go on so let's take a look the next slide is the problem behaviors are very common the most consistent abnormality that you're going to see over the course of dementia the course of dementia varies anywhere Alzheimer's dementia between eight to ten years but it goes anywhere from three years to twenty years all right so you can see the differences in terms of life span and now there are multiple types of dementia has anything in in this world it gets more complicated so we're finding different forms each of these different forms have a different we'll say memory effects if you will and other neurological deficits that we really have to be a student of to pick them up because it really does mean our this is this particular type more prone to behaviors versus not and if so how do we differentiate that and how are we going to adjust our medications okay and the behaviors are characterized for any of you that are involved in taking care of some dementia patients agitation verbal and aggressive behave behaviors all right and what does that mean hitting patients are hitting slapping biting kicking anybody have experience with their patients on that okay that's disturbing re or the good old yelling and screaming help me help me help me help me shut up well yeah all right and you just want to say that but these are all problems and they're difficult to manage and by the way how we manage them is different starting off by I want to say that the thing is a significant thing is is that there are serious complications that can be associated with that I can walk up to you and I could say you know you're a son of a [ __ ] all right and you're gonna slap me alright how dare you say that to me so number one patient may get hurt the other resident may get hurt and if somebody's trying to do a activities of daily living cleaning them changing them whatever it is they may get agitated they made kick and scratch is this comment yes it's very common okay and the question comes up is what do you do about it okay when the problem is is that the treatment options are very limited I can go through a list of about four different medicine medical medication groups and we've tried them all and each of them are associated with complications all right some more serious than not some of them as I said that can even result in death the more common drugs that have been used all right are now have the black box warning saying that you could die from this from sudden cardiac death that's only a minor not a minor complication but that's only one of the many complications that are associated with taking these medicines next slide please so possible solution can the use of cannabis be a benefit to assist in the management of these behaviors next slide so first thing is what is cannabis and what is marijuana so I'm gonna go through some basics and just so we all understand that and hopefully bring it home in terms of what we're looking at when we're trying to evaluate the benefit versus the risk of using marijuana or cannabis all right in our patients so next slide so the cannabis plants which are oftentimes said the marijuana plant so they use them interchangeably but it really is a cannabis plant alright and originally they were from East Asia but now as we all know they're cultivated throughout the whole world so everybody's growing marijuana all right original use was Industrial fiber seed oil hemp seed oil for example hemp seeds for recreational purses purposes religious and spiritual purposes to elevate the mood and lastly now more recently with the medication that we're looking at in terms of is this an appropriate type of medicine you actually have three different strains the most common ones there's probably several ones listed seva sativa the indica strain and one that we don't hear much about is this third strain which a true Dallas ruderalis and this Teva notoriously that strain so if you have a plant that's high or of this de Teva strain its where really most of the marijuana in quote marijuana as we can't say it which is invigorating uplifting okay and activating if you will makes you feel good as opposed to the indica stre which is more sedating relaxing sleep makes you sleep better okay there's characteristic and where CBD comes from okay so the next slide so the two main varieties that we see from coming from these plants and I'll start by saying there's a term that they use is of final phyto cannabinoids alright and we'll just use cannabinoids in general it's a technical term I realize that but the reason I'm using that is phyto means that there are the naturally occurring which is where marijuana comes from literally and then the endocannabinoids and guess what there in our brain we have marijuana going in our brain let's call it cannabis as opposed to marijuana all right so it's kind of tricky we'll get to that a little bit more so marijuana has a high THC content psychoactive intoxicating this is what we traditionally see on the streets and everybody's taking it particularly for all those medical problems that it's interesting how the young people have more medical problems than the older people when it comes to use of marijuana it's kind of interesting all right and then hemp all right which is basically CBD content in what we're seeing the CBD oils and different products from CBD that we're seeing on the market all right it's not psychoactive it's not intoxicating and again this is where most of the uses was in for industrial use again hemp seed hemp oil now the amazing thing is is that this last thing these are chemicals that circulate or that are fun in this plant there are four hundred approximately four hundred and eighty different chemicals that are in our marijuana plant hey and second of all of those known there's about 65 that have some chemical structure that are related to the endocannabinoids which are the ones that are circulating in our brain okay so it's a plant and you say well you know where should we really be dealing with this but how many of you familiar everybody's familiar with penicillin where did it come from it comes from a mold okay so it's be surprising how many things we might get up natural products that may be a benefit to us that we don't know about the problem is we need to study it and decide what is appropriate what isn't appropriate so some of the terms that you may hear marijuana the main ingredient in that is THC and that mostly comes from the flowers all right in the leaves of the plant when you get down to the stalks the plants this is where hemp is derived from from the stems and the stalks then you have terpenes and terpenoids and science interesting is it but how many Herot of aromatherapy all right everybody's heard of Roma therapy that's basically terpenoids it's a it's a class of chemicals that gives us scent all right I was recently in Amsterdam and it's like on every other corner is either a coffee shop which is literally a marijuana shop as opposed to a cafe which is a coffee shop or a head's shop all right which is all marijuana and it was kind of interesting because I went in there and they say well this is a lemon flavor this is a strawberry favor this is a caramel flavor I mean how many flavors do you have but nonetheless this is basically what they're talking about the terpenoids end up making the the smell and that they have very as medicinal effects such as lavender for example is relaxing to help you go to sleep so theoretically the terpenoids have some contribution to the effects of marijuana and then you have hash and hashish which is basically an extracted cannabis product composed of compressed purified preparations of stock resin gland and hashish is oftentimes the drug that they refer to which is the resident of the cannabis plant this is something that normally is smoked a lot so for some of the younger people this is probably old hat in here am i right now I'm looking I'm looking around for the younger nobody's even acknowledged he met alright and then lastly and this is where I got to keep in mind for those that are growing marijuana plants if you take a marijuana plant and you just crush it up put everything in it that's what you're going to get and you're gonna smoke it but you don't know what's in it and that's a real problem in a sense you don't know if it's got a lot of THC you don't know if it's got byproducts that are dangerous for you so and that's why buying street marihuana is really a raise as a concern in terms of what you're getting in that product okay so it's very variable therapeutic effect I don't know if you know but the recent statistics since marijuana has been legalized the number of ER visits associated with acute psychotic reactions related to that have gone up significantly okay so the only point is to point out some of the concerns that you have with what you're getting and and what effect it's going to have on you and the concerns that we all have and so if I has a geriatric doc is going to be prescribing a medicine for you or your loved one my concern is am i doing more harm am I going to create some problems okay so as I mentioned predominate temp is predominantly CBD this is normally what we're getting when we go and get some CBD all right has a lower concentration of THC it is the only legalized form of cannabis that can be prescribed without a prescription you know in order to get marijuana you have to have a medical marijuana card in order to get CBD you really don't now the good news is that it recently has been reclassified I think it's reclassified in thirty states Arizona is one of them so let me go back and just talk about when I talk about a Schedule one schedule to schedule one is no currently accepted medical use and the highest potential for abuse where do the opiates come they come in schedule two proven medical benefit all right but a high risk for abuse and that's why we have the open opioid crisis schedule 5 is medications with a low quantities of narcotics and low potential for abuse now I put robitussin does everybody know robitussin dm has everybody taking it you know that's a drug as central nervous side effects alright theoretically and the doses that we get or give you're probably not going to get much but actually so CBD has gone from a scheduled one all the way down to a Schedule five that's good news okay however the criteria must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration it can't have a content higher than 0.3 and that's vary from state to state some people will say 0.1% all right marijuana still scheduled as get Road ones rug so it's still not legal can be purchased without obtaining the medication of a marijuana card and the federal law keep in mind here's the difference a federal law it's still illegal CBD is still illegal some of you may have seen the news where the lady was arrested getting on an airplane she had CBD cream or oil or point mint of some sort and she was arrested it's under the airports are under federal jurisdiction therefore it's theoretically illegal and I want to mention that because from the standpoint of myself and treating this I have to be careful I mean if I do it in a federally regulated facility am I breaking the law and the question come and I don't want to get arrested not yet I mean you know I just got back one more just real quick gee oh that's I wanted to say so you really have to be careful federal law still has that Seabee oil and other cannabis cannibal dials are listening to schedule a and the newest drug which is mostly CBD is epi epi Leah Dix I don't know if you've heard about this but this is the medicine that now has been approved for seizures and young kids and really thought to be a benefit the studies look promising and there's a couple of new drugs that are coming out soon and ou allude to them as we go on next slide please so these are the benefits all right potential benefits all right keep in mind that CBD is a non psychoactive and there are very few side effects we've already talked about the pediatric seizures epidural ox is mine anxiety nausea vomiting inflammatory conditions paying Alzheimer's dementia Parkinson's disease but actually studied more in Parkinson's disease in an Alzheimer's dementia alright but so these are some of the potential benefits and now if these are benefits why aren't we looking at them more closely and try to determine you know what are these benefits and are there any potential side effects next slide on the other hand THC I'll talk a little bit more about the ratios THC is activating and a CBD counteracts that activation by cousin and relaxing so if you combine the two has thought that you may potentiate the effect of the eventual effective of any of the symptoms that you are treating on the other hand the CBD counteracts you just don't want to give the THC to you know having everybody sort of activated if you will that's what you're trying to suppress particularly in patients who have a cognitive impairment alright but pain is probably the biggest area where we're talking about and this is arthritic pain as well as what they call neuropathic pain or peripheral neuropathies opioid modulation we're gonna get to that a little bit more and I'm gonna tell you a little bit about how I think that there is some positive things coming out of the use of the marijuana that we're seeing in dealing with anxiety insomnia and spasticity the spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis so there is a new drug that's going to be coming out soon if any day is going to be approved for the use in patients who have must multiple sclerosis and has an appetite stimulant and I'm a little bit more or less disappointed in the one that we currently have we have a drug called Marinol and I think it's very expensive I've used it I think it's worthless drug and I unfortunately people still ask if we can take it and I usually say no because it is expensive and Medicare does not pay for it next slide so these are the synthetic cannabinoids which are Marinol is the drug that I talked about with regards to appetite stimulant epi dialogue which is for the pediatric seizures salty Beck says is the one that's now going to be produced it's almost there for spasticity with multiple sclerosis very positive outcome but good studies are eight that have shown the benefit and that's what really we need and then you have that naturally-occurring canna at cannabinoids which are marijuana in the derivatives and then now over-the-counter CBD as you as I mentioned you know I need any prescription you don't need anything you can walk in and you get CBD a buy it bottom line it's pretty expensive so bear with me again we're using CBD is it a benefit and I'll give you my own personal experience as a physician prescribing it for some of my patients next slide as you might guess we all know that smoking and vaping are big things I do want to tell you that I did bring along some brownies for you when you leave so I hope you had enjoy the rest of your day and just enjoy all right these are very common my wife just got some but I see quite a few people in terms of using this and rubbing it on our thrity joints I'm gonna say it's probably 50/50 and keep in mind you always have to think in terms of placebo something soft on your on your arthritic pain might make you feel better but it isn't really truly doing anything for the inflammation then the tinctures and oils this is what we are more or less using in our studies because it's easy for the patients to take the problem with the Edible is it's highly variable of how much marijuana if you will is in that particular cookie that you're taking and now you know in alcoholic beverages as well as soft drinks they are now putting CBD in those drinks and lastly transdermal patches and suppositories hopefully we don't have to get to that point to use those next slide so what is some relationship between plant cannabis all right the phyto cannabinoids all right and the endocannabinoid cannabinoids come yeah all right next slide all right so there is an endocannabinoid system in our brain and it consists of it's a biological system is composed of a lot of cannabinoids that are moving around in the brain okay all right and they actually ask as neurotransmitters I like this short order neurotransmitter transmitters basically what I'm saying is I say if you feel depressed okay the cannabinoids will have an increased secretion of those they'll hook onto the cannabinoid receptors and maybe counteract the depression so that makes sense to you you follow me so it's a chemical that attaches on or the chemical itself that's going to cause a reaction that's the same mechanism as all the other drugs that we use by the way right how many of you heard of serotonin okay so serotonin same thing okay basically the same thing and look how much we've studied with serotonin all right dopamine another one these are all chemicals that circulating the brain and have our neurotransmitters that create some kind of a reaction where they hook on to a receptor okay so the two that we know of now and there are many all right just what two AG and you don't have to know this but but these are mostly fun in the brain and then Ananda mind is the other one which is fun in higher concentrations of the body now the reason I say that is that they're all over the place so you have certain ones that are predominantly in the brain and certain ones that are predominantly in the bloodstream circulating in the body okay now they are also broken down and I maybe this is a little too technical but CBD and THC work a little bit differently CBD attacks this enzyme which breaks down cannabinoids okay and you don't want to do that I'm going to just say if you use Parkinson's disease you have dopamine and you have an absence of dopamine that gives you the Parkinson's symptoms so the question comes up is you don't want to take something that might be a benefit for you and decrease that okay on the other hand THC acts directly on the receptors alright and if it gives you more of a prolonged effect alright for whatever that endpoint is on the receptor depends on what system is in if it's in the system of the hypothalamus for example it may improve your appetite okay if it's in another system may help your memory if you will alright so there's different different mechanisms we just don't know enough about them yet next slide then these are the receptors cb1 receptors which are found mostly in the brain and spinal cord and then these they're concentrated in the brain regions associated with that behavior so again I mentioned the hypothalamus and maybe if we're gonna stimulate the appetite for example and just using that again cannabinoids you give them and they're going to stimulate the appetite you hear that the rationale behind the thinking behind is there a benefit for appetite stimulant and then the cb2 receptors found in a peripheral nervous system now this is where the anti-inflammatory approach comes in so it works on the immune system and it creates an anti-inflammatory so if you have arthritis theoretically all right it's going to make the arthritis feel less inflamed if you will as an anti-inflammatory drug and I don't know if as we get older the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs these of the advils and that person and a whole host of medicines that we take for our arthritis but as we get older there are more complications associated with it so for all practical purposes they almost become contraindicated in our older patients again what alternatives do we have for managing pain okay then I won't go into that x5 so let's take a look these are the things that internally in our own brain that they may be affecting appetite metabolism pain sleep mood movement it goes all the way down all right now the reason I say that our our older patients but better yet dementia patients have trouble with the appetite they may not eat they have pain that they can't describe so we don't know whether they have or have not pain but the older you get more likely you're gonna have arthritic pain sleep insomnia is a common problem people have sleep disorders all right and mood so it waxes in wane sometimes or more activated other times are more sleepy so we really have to deal with that but remember they also are involved in our basic functions our everyday living okay next slide so the latest term that's coming out is are there individuals which have a lower amount that are necessary to maintain good health vitality and well-being all right so this is called an end and kinetic cannabinoid deficiency and is there a syndrome that occurs now let me give you just a rough maybe guesstimate because it is being used how many people are familiar with fibromyalgia okay everybody okay good all right that's it's so about depressed effect aches all over okay do you think maybe it could be that there's a cannabinoid which affects all of these areas that that our patients complain of with fibromyalgia it's being tried so far there are no definitive results but I noticed that they are using it more and more and people who have fibromyalgia with the Hope Center because there is no good treatment so far all right there's a lot of treatment that's out there question is note I said good treatment so it's always possible to look into this so it raises the question is why are we looking at this if we look at dopamine deficiency serotonin deficiency why are we looking at the cannabinoid deficiency there's occurs in the brain next slide so and why is there more need this is certainly the reason why there's a need for more studies next slide ok I'll start off by saying is there a plus side all right to the use of marijuana that's been described we talked about all the symptoms and symptoms that are associated with it okay I feel hi that might be kids that are good a lot of these others were not sure of but we still use it with the hopes that we're gonna feel better have a good time sometimes it's the difference between taking an alcoholic beverage as well as a puff of marijuana that the trade-off is you're gonna feel better maybe with both which one has the least amount of side effects there are those what argue marijuana has the least amount of side effects I'm not going to go there but let's let's go studies have shown that that there is a reduction in prescription medicine so let's take a look at that a very important slide next slide so changes associated with state having a medical marijuana law in numbers of Medicaid prescriptions for drugs used to treat condition with medical marijuana look at this anxiety depression Lacombe a-- nausea pain psychosis seizures sleep the only ones spasticity quite sure why that fell out to be quite frank with you but the bottom line is so there are some studies that that you can look at CMS the Medicare Medicaid data and come up with there's less there's a reduction in the use of medications for each of these next one even more important okay in consideration of the opioid epidemic all right we have now look at over here this is every number of daily doses filled with the prescription drugs annually per physician in states with medical marijuana law by condition categorize category studied compared to the average number in states without a law look at the difference and and the one I point to is paying okay now we're in an opioid crisis no I don't want to say that we're gonna trade an opioid crisis for a marijuana crisis all right but the point being is as a river really need to look at this very very closely because we are in an opioid crisis and the question is do we have an alternative all right in terms of particularly going through withdrawal and some of the other medicines that we give to our patients who are addicted to opioids so that's a very important statistic I thought and perhaps a benefit that we need to look into a little bit more now as you know there's also on the other side in States who have legalized marijuana there's an increased incidence of motor vehicle accidents alright so a lot of negative things that obviously is quoted in the newspapers and you can quote it either way for those probe those anti marijuana use my concern is is that we just need more studies in order to make sure that we know what we're doing next thing next slide so this gives you an idea of the different studies if you take a look at the number of studies all right these are controlled studies 28 for paying 28 for nausea vomitting 14 for multiple sclerosis and if you take a look at the patients now the point is in order to have an adequate research study you really have to have large numbers and what's problem is is that if you go all the way down and looking here sleep disorder psychosis anxiety disorders alright there are very few studies you're really looking at them here and this is from 2:15 2015 now this was a meta-analysis so basically the Cochran study what they usually do is they look at all these studies that are put together all right that have been done on marijuana and they try to analyze whether they've been good studies or bad studies in this case they just looked to see if there were studies but take a look at these numbers I mean for twenty four glaucoma is something that wherever it is there's only a few six six studies for glaucoma and yet that's being billed as something that you can use marijuana for glaucoma and for eggs sleep disorders all right which are very common not only in our patients with dementia but in our older population in general so you could see there aren't many studies next slide so pain management since that is it so again here was again another Cochran study where they looked at all these different studies now note a lot of these with cannabinoid and with THC and the others are usually with pharmaceutical companies but if you really take a look all those dots are squares that are on the right side all right show that that favors the use of marijuana all right those on the opposite side know and negative I didn't go into each of these studies to see whether they were good studies bad studies whatever they may be I'm gonna point out some problems that we have with our dementia patients in terms of doing studies and how effective they are and the problems we have on judging whether or not they are really truly an improvement or not and I'll go into that a little bit later but the consensus is is that they probably do help in pain so let's take a look at that and can we find something the pharmaceutical industry is trying to produce an fda-approved drug alright which will have the combination of THC and CBD and to try to see whether or not it's effective or not and hopefully like some of the other drugs will get that passed so that you are able to take that whether you're it's federally regulated or not that you will be able to take that as a drug next slide don't go too far with this but I will tell you this all right and much as I talked about serotonin and dopamine alright there is some consider in some of the bay science is that maybe this is marijuana as neuroprotective now one of the things is with regards to marijuana they say it creates apathy all right over a long term used chronic use but we don't know what that chronic use is so the question is a little bit okay or is too much not okay so we don't know the answer to that so the bottom line is that but they it may be neuroprotective now again I don't want to go into this but I will solve it but much as I talked about serotonin dopamine and cannabinoids alright with dementia acetylcholine goes down alright and the drugs that we have available increase the acetylcholine alright and that improves memory that's just a very simple simplistic version of what happens in Alzheimer's dementia but THC competes competitively inhibits cholinesterase inhibitor all right that's what breaks down acetylcholine so and that's how the mechanism of these new drugs work is they they destroy the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine are you all following me on that I mean is that okay you got okay so I'm trying so that is one mechanism the other is is there's a still a theory that that this is an anti inflammatory process so we're looking at drugs perhaps that would be anti inflammatory in nature one of the drugs that promoted that maybe we don't even you don't even know about is is the statins are anti inflammatory and a lot of the benefits of the statins are from its anti-inflammatory effects so the question comes up is this is somewhat like an antioxidant and actually there's some pretty good studies with our diet that we take which is high in antioxidants is a good diet is one of the factors that you can be on to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer's dementia so I mean we can do a lot of this on our own the question comes up is is there an effect on from the will comb cannabinoids for right now in terms of perhaps delaying the onset or improving dementia in our patients this we don't know not looking into that now but there are some studies next day next time so these are the drugs now in in dementia studies that have been and I'm gonna kind of go over these a little bit quickly but Marinol is the only drug that has been approved and for appetite stimulant that's predominantly its effect we've used that and it supposedly causes decreased agitation I'm just going to tell you right now I think it's worthless I think it's an expensive drug that has very little effect and I don't prescribe it because it's not covered by Medicare first of all you have to pay for it I just don't think it's of any benefit so most of the studies that came out are really using low dose everybody's concerned with THC and for justifiable reasons it makes you high so if I have an agitated patient with dementia do I want to give them a drug that's going to make them more agitated okay so what they did is they they gave low dose of THC alright and and it didn't appear more beneficial than placebos in a small study only 58 patients received this and they received a relatively small dose of THC over a period of time did not have CBD in it so the question comes up or it may have had a little but mostly it was THC study so then they went to a little bit higher doses using cannabis oil and in 11 patients no I want to tell you again love and patience means nothing how many of people have heard of prevacid gonna have a scent I know even if you're taking it I'm gonna tell you it's a waste of money but alright the point being is is that the studies that we're done are absolutely ridiculous and how they have marketed that I think is really pathetic because they are making tons and tons of medicine on this drug it's not a drug you can get over the counter but I think it's actually like $60.00 a month something like that and I just think it's a shame it's it's we're a vulnerable society and we don't want to get dementia so if somebody advertises this drug no harm but you're paying $60 a month if you're on a limited income that's a lot of money okay plain and simply but these were done on hospitalized patients now the NPI is one of the tests that is good for monitoring behaviors in dementia patients and in non dimensions okay but mostly in dementia patients now these were patients who are hospitalized so we just say when a hospitalized patients is high with dementia is hospitalized there are 18 other different things that can be going on the most common which is delirium so we don't know if it helped of delirium or the dementia they seem to say that it was improved and maybe it's a drug that we should look at as opposed to some of the more toxic drugs that we use in hospitalized patients who develop delirium maybe we should look into them the Cochrane review all right basically found no evidence that cannabinoids are effective in reducing symptoms so that basically saying is all the studies it's inconclusive that there is any benefit that doesn't mean that they're abnormal next slide I like to study that recently came on it's a study from Sweden and it came out in this past in April of two night 2019 and they did and the reason I liked this study is because this is along the studies that we're doing in in our dementia units okay they were in a dementia directed care facilities and Jen mentioned to you that that I work out of a facility called Silverado and it's a dementia directed care assisted living facility all patients with dementia it's a prospective study so we're kind of starting with a baseline all right but anyway they did ten female patients I have no idea why they only included female patients as opposed to male patients with severe behavioral problems and they were given larger than previous doses of cannabis and here's this ratio CBD and THC so if you're gonna give larger doses of THC you want to counterbalance that with CBD now the question comes up is are we negating the effects of THC by giving the CBD or what nobody knows this answer okay we don't know this answer but they did monitor the behaviors and the results there was a 40% improvement and behavior scales and they used a decrease of psychotropic medicines now I will tell you here if I have somebody on psychotropic medicines alright and then I decrease their medicine you know they're more alert more active and so what are we dealing with we're dealing with the excess disability associated with these medicines so the idea is it was at the marijuana or was it us just decrease into medication okay improving up daily care and improvement in direct contact so if you're a zombie on mantra medicine and I take you off the medicine and all of a sudden you're communicating to me I'm just saying this is some of the difficulties that we have in studying this it's just not an easy thing to study however the relief there was no adverse side-effects which is great and there was relief was persistent after two months off the medicines and by the way when we take patients off medicines oftentimes they get better and stay better with or without marijuana so it is tricky next slide this is the Arizona study that we're talking about now first of all I wanted to talk about some of the problems we have encountered with regards to beginning this study and doing this study we're in the process of it now but you have to get a marijuana card and from Arizona the state of Arizona the question comes up is if you have a patient who has dimension no longer capable of making their own healthcare decisions then does the caregiver be responsible for getting a card but basically now the consensus is is that both the caregiver as well as the patient have to get a card now this entails now take a ninety-year-old with dementia who has had dementia for eight years do you think they have a driver's license do you think they have a recent photo huh yeah you hope not that's right so my point being is it's really hard to get this information and it becomes costly I don't know if any of you know what the cost of staying in a a dementia directed care facility I mean it's anywhere from 5,000 to 8,000 and and continually going up okay that's a lot of expenses now you throw an other expense on we are actually we need two cards we're gonna get the medicine for for free so you need to necessary offer me information and the left doesn't know the right to be quite frank with you as far as what the actual law is so and and there's still a lot of confusion and I hear different things and the other concern is liability issues all right facility will maybe not wanting to take an effective side effects now we're doing I want to consider this as a pilot study and not at what they call an institutional review board study which is much more scientific but I want to get some preliminary data then go and get a random randomized controlled study that would allow me to have more teeth in this so we're at this point we're using anywhere from 15 to 20 20 patients and keep in mind I don't know that I could get this done in a federal facility so a skilled nursing facility that's under the regulations of federal regulations I'm not quite sure I can do that and as I mentioned the liability concerns at this point though I'm at least glad that they have legalized marijuana medicinal marijuana in Arizona that allows me at least to opened the door and start these studies yes well you have to go through a Medicare I'm sorry I'm a marijuana prescriber usually all right so I'm a medical marijuana prescriber and so I can it's okay to order it I put my name I fill out a form that your PCP can do that also it's very easy to get a medication marijuana card rather so but for this in this particular study I'm the primary care physician for the most part and if I'm not I will get it through the primary care physician of whoever's the physician for the Alzheimer patient that's not not a patient of mine next fine all right so this is our study anywhere from 10 to 15 to 20 we have approximately 15 patients that are signed up about a 16 week trial we're using the cannabis oil that's been shown to be the best route for patients who have dementia with a 2 to run CBD to THC all right now the other thing I wanted to mention is if you're going to get THC it has to be quantify alright because if I get THC from you and you and you from a particular company it's liable to be a different mo I don't know the amount okay and that's one of the problems when particularly when you buy stuff in the street or on the market wherever you're going you don't know how much you're getting and that's a real problem okay and we're gonna gradually increase these doses every two to four weeks and see what kind of a Reese we are we're going to follow alright with a washout period of time much like the previous study and see whether or not we've done some benefit with this but again all those things that we talked about is it am I where I want to get as the initial start this on initial patience with behaviors before they are on the more serious and more toxic drugs alright we haven't got that far yet but hopefully that would be the initial drug that we might try and I'd like to try that rather than seeing patients on multiple medications alright so we're gonna use the appropriate scales we're gonna have nursing observation which sometimes can be really subjective as opposed to objective go looking at drug reduction including the use of breakthrough medications obviously looking for the adverse reactions and making sure that is there some reversion back to the original behaviors after we stop the marijuana okay next slide break from medicine is I order as needed medicine so if you really get agitated while I'm getting your behaviors under control I'll have them give you some medicine to calm you down during that period of time while I'm working on a broader perspective of getting your behaviors under control our philosophy has always start low so rather than starting high and knocking the patient out I would rather start slow and go slowly but occasionally a little bit may not be enough and you may need some breakthrough medicine okay okay everybody so the side effects perhaps one of the more common ones is increased anxiety associated with tachycardia and that's the THC that's what you get when you take marijuana okay you get a little bit more anxious alright some people all right that's one side effects of too much THC elevation of a blood pressure tachycardia decreased concentration sleepiness so then you get the CBD that might be kicking in headaches dizziness paranoia and hallucinations I mean most of our patients who have to mention behaviors are have hallucinations or paranoia and they have delusions so we don't want to make those worse and the number one factor that we have to look at for this is the drug drug interaction okay I've had a negative success not good success in fact I think I've made situations worse by combining marijuana with anti-psychotic drugs that bothers me it makes me very hesitant first slide do no harm all right so am i doing more harm or less harm and I hate to say this I don't know what the hell I'm doing with the marijuana I mean I really know because we don't have any studies so but this is the biggest concern I go back to the dopamine serotonin and now the cannabinoids in the brain and we're messing with chemicals in the brain so do we know what we're doing and where are we going with that so that's a my biggest concern offhand next slide so where do we stand at this particular you know I guess I've not had positive experiences using marijuana there are those that have had positive experiences now the other effect is is it a placebo effect too so I'm taking medicine but patients don't know so you want to anticipate that you take that placebo component placebo is where you give them something that's not really a medicine and you in a lot of our drugs that are tested are placebo and and and the drug you'd be surprised how many people respond to the placebo a good 20 30 percent respond to placebo and some studies much higher by the way and particularly the drugs that we use are anti-psychotic drugs by the way that we use we need better clarification of the current regulations regarding the use of marijuana and then we need more liberalization of the laws alive for more research you know we've tried for years to do research projects with marijuana but you have to go they need to be federally improved and it's illegal so you can't you can't get a study with marijuana because it's federally against the law and this needs to be changed I mean you can prevent whatever you want to do but let's studies be done so we have a better idea of what's going on so we have a lot of potential but we're not there yet next slide so our goal is provide the best quality of life our patients comes in all walks of life in all degrees of chronic disease all right and so we always need to be looking for ways that we can improve on the health and again here's the case of take you providing the best quality of life as opposed to giving medicines that are going to give you a poor quality of life it's a balancing act it's difficult there is no magic answer all right but this is what ultimately we're looking at and so the next slide so be careful what we wish everybody in this room that came to this lecture I'm sure is saying I hope marijuana is perhaps an answer that we can use in conjunction with making our patients feel a little bit better okay number one on the list by the way it's an industry all right and they are expanding in leaps and bounds and what do you think there's much money being invested in made in its success all right we are a vulnerable population okay and looking for instant relief we always have been will always be and I don't blame us but at the same time we can be exploited and I think I'm throwing the words of caution out and we're not sure yet of the short and long term you hear this constantly over and over we don't know what the short term we don't know what the long term effects are all right so basically we really need to be studying a little bit more before we jump on the bandwagon because you're seeing it on the internet you're seeing it advertised you're seeing it everywhere take this but there's a lot of people making a lot of money it's expensive it's very expensive all right probably more than your routine meds that you take that are prescribed by the doctors and in reality it's not covered by Medicare so and the last slide is what we're really doing is looking to provide that quality of care and quality of life that we want happy patients all of us should you know be in a good place when we're dying death is inevitable and my goal at least is to see that you are in the most comfortable place with the best quality of life and best quality of care not always easy to do but we work hard and that's where geriatrics and hospice Doc's are really important in trying to provide that so with that I'll stop and thank you and any questions we'll open it up to questions [Applause]", "clLoixOZx2Q": "hi everybody my name is jaime brambila my company name is heat cbd and grace health and wellness they're two separate companies heat cbd manufactures cbd products and great self-enrollment is a practice dedicated to teaching interested patients about the clinical use of cannabinoids so in august of 2018 my wife nicole was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer we learned that the cancer had eaten through her four five and six vertebrae and that she would require eight hours final surgery to correct it the metastases was the only thing holding her neck up when we got to memorial sloan kettering in new york the doctors had explained that her standard of care most likely would include six rounds of chemo radiation and many surgeries to remove the tumor masses so the outlook was looking very grim and but nonetheless we we wanted to go through it full force so the ironic thing is that well before this we started in the cannabis field with the delivery service in california where we were working with patients that were afflicted with critical ailments everything from epilepsy to autism ms and cancer we made the decision to focus on the medical rather than the recreational doing part from the responsibility from the people looking for alternative therapies so after nicole's diagnosis we decided to go full force into understanding uh the monster that cancer is and how [Music] and so we never i never expected uh the outcome of nicole's case um but you know we decided to make this a positive journey and that was nicole's request so that's what we did so the presentation today is going to be about raising awareness and raising awareness about this is successful implementation of natural and plant-based medicines used with standard of care for metastatic breast cancers so we know uh what we know about cannabinoid streptains in the ketogenic diet is that when they're used with traditional standards of care they're positive additions and so um why are they positive digits well they they work synergistically to improve the patient outcome so these compounds uh offer a cytotoxic effect as well as a palliative effect and the more well-researched effect is the palliative effect which will which we'll discover um later on the presentation we will explain in current detail what science understands about uh the effects of these compounds so a little bit of background uh story so cannabinoids exert cytotoxic and p and palliative effects uh by means of physiological modulation through the endocannabinoid system and our bodies are naturally able to produce endocannabinoids which interact with receptor sites within the endocannabinoid system and the purpose for this system is to create the state of homeostasis so all the all the functions that the endocannabinoid system produces it are still unknown and but what we've discovered so far is that this system is intricately tight almost every bodily function that we have silas simon and cylosine come from um magic mushrooms and if anybody is familiar with that uh these compounds are in the class of psychedelics known as tryptamines and these compounds are agonists of the 5h25ht serotonin receptor group which are g protein coupled receptors and that means that the the receptor sites are anchored to the cell membrane so what we important thing to keep in mind is that gpcrs or g-protein-coupled receptors have been identified to perform a phenomenon called heterodymerization or crosstalk and that basically means that when there's a similarly structured receptor one receptor gets activated by an agonist and another one that is similarly structured gets activated as well without the use of the ligand so ketogenic or low carb high fat diets these have been studied for their effects in our metabolism and what what they've been the researchers but they've been able to identify is that ketone bodies are produced in the liver and our bodies are able to use them instead of using glucose as fuel so this has a profound effect on our physiology especially in our cell metabolism anti-cancer mechanisms of action of cannabinoids psilocybin and ketogenic low-carb high-fat diets so in this presentation we're going to review is what current science understands as to the aforementioned compounds i will briefly explain the anti-proliferative anti-invasive and anti-metastatic mechanisms of each adjunct therapy as well as the palliative effects so we're going to start off with the first uh hallmark of cancer and that's proliferation what we understand about proliferation is that it hap it comes after the cell is mutated it's the first significant stage of a cancer cell progression and this is when cells start to divide and reproduce to start forming the tumor mass one of the very important things to keep in mind here in proliferation research is a protein called akt also known as protein kinase b and it's one of the most studied molecular mechanisms of uh because of its effectual potential effects of on apoptosis so the inhibition of akt protein uh initiates a signaling pathway that activates autophagy and this internal leads to programmed sultan also known as apoptosis so in other words keep uh important thing to keep in mind here is that if you turn off akt the cancer cell dies so how do we know uh cannabinoids exert antiproliferative effects well in pre-clinical studies uh cannabinoids uh have been studied for their pre their pro-episodic effects the specific mechanisms of how cannabinoids exert all these effects on cancer cells are still unknown because the system is just too complex there are many receptor sites and many lightings uh involved in endocannabinoid system function and with a recent study from the technion institute of israel done on identifying the heterogeneity and complexity of cannabis extracts as tumor agents we can see an example of that so the more well-known mechanisms of action though research from the completence university of madrid they published the one of the most significant papers on this subject uh it showed that activation of cannabinoid receptors triggers a signaling cascade that causes cell apoptosis and it's done through stimulation of endoplasmic reticulum which creates uh ceramide accumulation in the cell so that that's that's the route on which uh can happen how can ambulance turn off akt and then in another study that was published in a later day from the same university we can see that the pro-apoptotic effects are specific to erbb2-positive breast cancer cells which we know are the her2 new positive breast cancers so here we're going to show a slide uh just so you guys can see the the route the signaling wrap and here we can see that er stress is activated by the cannabinoid receptors that air stress uh activates a process called the noble ceramide the the nova synthesis ceremony and that activates uh something called p8 which eventually activates something called trip3 which eventually uh activates ckt and starts the process of autophagy and apoptosis so what do we know are the anti-proliferative effects of psilocybin the tryptamines uh such as cytosine psilocybin have the 19 have been observed to have strong and medium-high immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory and potentially pro-apoptotic effects that may cause the inhibition of akt and if any and if anybody of you are familiar with the signaling cascades called mitogen activated protein kinase or nuclear factor kappa b these are signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation cell differentiation and survival and normal cells so what they've discovered uh on tryptamines is that in lab models the when serotonin receptors are activated they also mediate heterodimerization and they and that's the coordinated crosstalk that we went over uh before so this happens between map case uh including p38 me kkk1 erk and pa3 kinase akht signaling pathways as well as nfkb and so this leads to an intricate fine-tuning of inflammatory responses by changes of cell signaling and we speculate that that's how akt is turned off by tryptomines and in the next slide i show an example of how um that heterodymerization that crosstalk happens when uh the five ht receptors are activated and this just kind of shows the the signaling cascade that happens in between so the second hallmark of cancer is hypoxia and one of the important things to identify here is an inducible factor called hif1 and basically what they've discovered what research has discovered is that when areas of severe oxygen deprivation arise this is called hypoxia and this happens in invasive tumors after hypoxia happens uh there's there's a signal that occurs by creating f1 that stimulates angiogenesis and angiogenesis is an important part of uh cell progression because that's basically when vascular tissue starts growing into the tumor cell mass and lymphatic tissue and that's how eventually this the cancer cells uh escape to metastasize so the next slide just shows a depiction of how hypoxia occurs and how the blood vessels start growing into the tumor mass to eventually form the metastases so there are many studies that show that cannabinoids actually block heph1 and in pre-clinical studies the activation of what the activation of cannabinoids in cancer cells cannabinoid receptors and cancer cells has shown to down regulate the expression of several pathways including v egf itself and hypoxia inducible factor f1 so the anti-angiogenic effects of psilocybin and cylistine uh cytosine is assumed to be a metabolite of psilocybin and it's assumed because the pharmacology of psilocybin is not yet well understood either but we know that this belongs to a class of psychedelics called tryptamines and in pre-clinical studies uh tryptamines have shown to have positive and strong effects on our physiology including immunomodulation anti-inflammation anti-tumor effects and these also include blocking hif1 through sigma 1 receptor activation so tryptamines activate sigma 1 and that's how if one is blocked in the cancer cell so now we reach the third hallmark of uh cancer progression and this is uh metastases and this is the final stage of um when a cancer i guess falls out of control uh the important mechanism here to keep in mind is id1 and what we've understood about uh breast cancers that express this mechanism this this agent id1 is that in breast cancers mammary epithelial cells expressing id1 are unable to differentiate they acquire the ability to proliferate and they invade the extracellular matrix so id1 is an important regulator of breast cancer progression that's why we're focusing on it today and so cannabinoids block id1 and out of all the agilent therapies that we're discussing today the one that counters iv1 uh that's been discovered so far is cannabidiol which is a cannabinoid that has a low toxicity profile and it down regulates id1 by modulating erk and reactive oxygen species pathways which eventually leads to id1 down regulation so i don't know if you guys noticed but i didn't touch on the ketogenic diets and the first two hallmarks of cancer and that's because um ketogenic diets work on on a route uh on themselves um they're separate from the routes that cytocyberan or cannabinoids connector and what we know about these diets is that they've been recently proposed as adjuvant therapies for cancer treatments because they target an effect called the warburg effect and that's basically an effect that describes that cancer cells predominantly utilize glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation phosphorylation sorry to produce atp and atp is very important for cell functioning some cancer cells lack the ability to metabolize ketone bodies because of mitochondrial dysfunction and also the enzymes that that help break down the ketone bodies so the rationale is providing the rationale in providing a fat rich low carbohydrate diet in cancer therapies to reduce circulating glucose levels and induce ketosis so the cancer cells are starved the normal cells adapt their metabolism to use ketones and so another important part of this is that ketosis therapy also reduces insulin insulin like growth factor which is also important for cell progression so what what are the effects the palliative effects that we know about so we know that these compounds have been recognized as effective palliative tools when used in conjunction with the usual standards of care the results are that symptoms are greatly reduced and in our anecdotal experience we've seen this uh time and time again with patients that are able to choose this and that happens it's important to stress this point because uh even though with cannabis uh half of the country uh has already legalized the medical use silas simon on the other hand is only legal in two counties in our country so hopefully we'll be able to change some minds today so that we can change that as well i'm going to go through some examples of how these compounds are good palliative tools and so many studies have shown the efficacy of psilocybin in cancer patients as agents to decrease the symptoms of depression caused by the side effects of standard of care so many studies have identified that students have established that simon and other psychedelics have uh very little physiological safety concerns but we still need to do more research to figure out what the psychological repercussions would be um so in john in one of the one of these studies that came from johns hopkins university they analyzed 51 patients that were diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer and what they found was that high doses of psilocybin produce a significant decrease in depression general anxiety and anxiety towards death it also produced an increase in quality of life and optimism and the important the important thing here or the uh thing that that is that creates the most impact is that after this these therapies were administered the result persisted even after um six months after the um the therapy was administered so cannabinoids we know that cannabinoids are safe and effective relative tools um people that have attended these symposiums have probably heard all about that and they have very good effects including an um antimatter effect uh antidepressant uh anti pain and the ability to induce uh sleep um i just briefly covered those just just to talk talk to them talk to you guys about them but what i want to what i want to emphasize on is the synergistic effect that these produce with standard of care and in recent lab studies from the completency university of madrid in collaboration with zelda therapeutics we've found that when we combine cannabinoids and estrogen receptor targeted therapies for example cis cisplatin or lapatinib in a petri dish uh what it shows is a positive additional antiproliferative response in cell cultures so the safety and efficacy of the ketogenic diets uh well these strongly depend on the type of tumor that is being treated in the genotype uh in involved so the information having a little mix up with my science so what we know uh so far about these uh therapies we don't have a lot of uh data on these because so far there's been just very little clinical data uh and single case studies that show the results of what this could do there hasn't been uh extensive randomized uh clinical studies yet but from the little information that we have we can we can see that these these therapies don't have evidence of interaction with standard care this most of the research conducted on these has been conducted on glioblastoma patients but there's also been recent studies that have found that patients with breast cancer equally benefit from these so the following study that i'm going to present is the case study that um captures my my wife's story and i'm going to briefly go through that uh just to explain what we did with her okay so i'll briefly go through this so protocols that were that were used uh we used standard of care she went through treatment every four weeks uh since the time of diagnosis to uh january of 2019 final diagnosis was august 2018 so she would take an infusion of taxation and herceptin progenitor and herceptin are the targeted therapies texas here's the chemotherapy uh we can see that she did a ketogenic diet in addition to supplements borage omega oils those are precursors to endocannabinoids you know pertinent adjuvants if they can be used uh vitamin b12 glucosamine pea which is a ligand of cannabinoid receptors and pre probiotic uh supplements and those we know now that work in conjunction with the endocannabinoid system so the doses that we administered of cannabis oil um they're relatively high and we can see that during several during different stages we the amounts of cannabis oil that we were dosing every day would fluctuate and that's because uh we you know through trial and error and through our method we were exploring with different uh cannabis strains and these were all whole plant uh cannabis extracts we can see that the use of psilocybin she had so she she had two heroic um sessions with psilocybin one happened in november 2018 the other one january 2019 right before she went for the pet scan that determined that she didn't have metastatic disease anymore and then here we can see the images right we can see the images of when the cancer was initially diagnosed and we can see the mass in the center and then this is the pets underneath that that's the pet ct scan that showed no evidence of metastatic disease and we can see clearly that the mass has shrunk significantly so what are the results so so she was diagnosed in september uh september 2018 the end of august uh so by october 2018 50 of the mass was visibly reduced uh her doctor could visibly see that 50 of the mass was reduced by october january 2019 uh pet ct scan confirmed no evidence of residual cancer or recurrent disease and that persisted today so in breast cancer patients tarsus mom is one of the best and most recent advances in the treatment of her2 positive breast cancer and although this strategy has been very successful the statistics show that about 75 percent of the patients with erbb2 over expressing tumors do not respond to tarstuza map and the ones that do respond which is almost 15 eventually develop metastases so this is why there's a need a tremendous need to develop novel therapeutic approaches so that we can improve patient survival in these patient populations there are many important benefits to initiating observational clinical trials to test these therapies but so far little attention has been given to do so and with correct research and proper clinical protocols minor side effects that can occur can be managed and accurate doses can be studied so that we can deliver proper therapeutic benefit so now now we're going to talk about the economic viability of producing an observation clinical trial using cannabis oil in contrast to the cost and time frame to produce a cancer drug so we went we went through an exercise using nicole's case study as an example um and we used the parameters from the case study the amount of oil that she took and the time frame and we went into weed maps we took a little survey to figure out what a gram of oil uh could cost and so two grams of oil is what we considered for you know a clinical trial to prove whether or not these these therapies have have these effects and what we came up with is that so we did a rough estimate and the cost on a daily basis for uh for a patient using this this therapy can range from sixty two dollars per day to a hundred a 120 per day and so considering the five months that this cost um can range between ninety three hundred dollars and eighteen thousand four hundred dollars roughly so now now we're going to observe a study that was published in the journal of american medical association and jama in september of 2017 and it analyzed the investment and return of 10 different cancer drugs that were recently brought to market from separate developers so what this study concluded was that the average time frame to develop a cancer drug was 7.3 years that's a considerable amount of time the median cost uh the medium r d cost and they broke it down into three categories because there are three uh you know categories um in the in the drug development uh pipeline right so novel or self-originating drugs those are drugs that discover uh new novel uh targets and cancer cells those um the medium r d cholesterol is 899 million dollars uh next in class which is uh a step above the science of what we currently understand so these are drugs that develop the science that we currently know a little bit better and those the medium r d cost is 473.3 million dollars and then we have acquired drugs on the low side of the totem pole which those cost 328.1 million dollars so that's the r d cost now all together and we know that r d plays a big role in price for drugs uh the median cost to bring a cancer drug to market was 648 million dollars and obviously this is this is an immediate estimate um there was a lot of uh range in in between those numbers so with all this with all this that we know if we can convince our lawmakers and medical professionals to give the described therapies the recognition they deserve and facilitate regulatory and financial conditions to research the true medical potential of these compounds we can assume that these results would impact lowering of cancer drug costs lowering of research and development cost increasing quality of life of standard of care and the increase of quality of life through pre and post cancer treatments for patients and with that i want to just uh thank the team uh at the end of this presentation for all the hard work that we did together um bringing this case study um to to light and uh here in the picture we have dr sulak lindsey myself caroline and tom my wife uh next to tom there so thank you guys", "q4maAFJSWAA": "[Music] I'd like to welcome everybody today's presentation on CBD in the treatment of Alzheimer's addictions and mood disorders I'm your host dr. Donnelly Snipes in this class we're going to talk about how we can use CBD in the treatment of addiction CBD and its impact on mental health issues CBD and its impact on neurodegenerative issues like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as hit a real high-level overview of CBD adverse events toxicity and drug interactions that is going to be really important because a lot of our clients may decide to try to self-medicate with CBD in addition to other medications and I'll just foreshadow for you CBD oil or CBD interacts with just about every medication out there so we do want to make sure that they're aware of that and hopefully agree to if they're going to try to start taking CBD do it in a physician supervised capacity all right cannabidiol is promise for treatment of substance use disorder CBD is short for cannabidiol and recent models implicate major brain circuits involved in reward salient C so how were warding something is motivation and memory and learned associations in substance abuse we call those triggers in maintaining addiction which may be largely modulated by the endocannabinoid system or the receptors in our brain that respond to cannabinoids and that includes THC as well as cannabidiol the endocannabinoid system or ECS modulates dopamine that's really important to recognize it also has an effect on noradrenaline and Sarah but we'll get there when we talk about addiction though one of the things that we have seen with addiction and try to avoid saying we know because we don't really know a whole lot for a hundred percent certain but one of the things that we've seen repeatedly with addiction is that addictive substances and addictive behaviors cause a dopamine surge the endocannabinoid system is there to try to modulate that dopamine so you don't get those surges quite so much alcohol nicotine and THC which is not CBD it is another cannabinoid that's in marijuana but alcohol nicotine and THC all increased dopamine levels via nerve terminals modulated by the in endocannabinoid system important to recognize that when people are using these addictive substances they are activating that endocannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system including receptors cb1 are which you don't need to know that for the test or anything but there is a particular receptor in there that represents a necessary contributor towards cellular adaptations in the transition from recreational substance use to a use disorder so when this CB 1 R is activated it causes changes or it facilitates changes in the brain cells in the system that facilitate the move from recreational use to dependence and and tolerance and all those other things the ECS mediated synaptic plasticity may facilitate emotional learning and memory processes in increasing emotional responses to substance related cues basically what that's saying is the enactment endocannabinoid system encourages the brain cells to be a little bit more flexible to be a little bit more receptive and responsive and which facilitates learning when though systems are activated that kind of primes the brain for learning based on memory so now they're in this wide-open situation think about a classroom you know when you create a classroom you want it to create an environment that's conducive to learning so you do certain things in the classroom and you don't do other things in order to make it so most people are comfortable there they have the materials they need to learn they are not distracted the same sort of thing goes on in our brain when our brain has the right environment to learn it is much more receptive to things and the endocannabinoid system facilitates that condition in the brain antagonism which means shutting down locking off turning off whatever you want to say antagonism of that cb1 are receptor reduces alcohol induced sensitization and nicotine relapse so they're finding that CBD may reduce the people from developing tolerance and sensitization to ethanol and it tends to make them less likely to relapse on nicotine CBD is non rewarding it doesn't have the psychogenic properties of THC that is super important to remember especially for people who are in recovery because CBD is not going to get them high it had acts on other receptors in order to facilitate other processes it acts on a number of receptor systems including the opioid system the serotonin system and the cannabinoid system so when people take CBD they are modulating those symptoms systemically administered CBD which means orally or intravenously by a doctor I guess but generally we're talking about oral systemic lis administered CBD regulates mesolimbic dopamine act that's important to know and potentially reduces substance-induced dysregulation so when people take CBD orally it keeps them from having that dopamine spike that may occur when they take substances because when we take substances that dopamine system gets dysregulated it just goes wide open and CBD seems to modulate that a little bit treatment with CBD blocked the rewarding effects of morphine and heroin and prevented drug and stress induced reinstatement of condition place preference lasting up to two weeks post administration so that's really interesting now conditioned place preference why do we care about this when somebody receives a reward receives a stimulus gets that dopamine rush in a particular place that place becomes associated with pleasure in substance abuse counseling we talk about this as you know a trigger being in that place being in a bar or if you you know use heroin when you're at home you know being at home could be a trigger and when people were given to CBD it seemed to block those memories and reduce the preference for certain places that are associated with use which is really awesome so it kind of reduces those urges a little bit and it lasted up to two weeks post administration CBD reduces a lot of different things and as always in this presentation all of the hyperlinks will take you to the Articles that I got this information from just to keep it clean I do the hyperlinks but CBD reduces in most people the overall level of alcohol intake the motivation for ethanol it's keeping them from becoming tolerant to it but it also kind of takes some of the rewarding effects out of it since its modulating that dopamine release it reduces anxiety and impulse which is helpful not only in alcoholism but a whole host of other mood mental health and even neurodegenerative disorders alcohol related to ptosis and fibrosis in the liver is also reduced because CBD reduces lipid accumulation so reduces that fatty liver it stimulates Auto Fei Jie so the liver the body starts eating consuming getting rid of whatever you want to say bad cells and it modulates inflammation we know that alcoholism causes inflammation in the liver and CBD helps modulate or reduce some of that inflammation now this isn't a pass where somebody can take CBD and then drink all they want I don't want them to start thinking that way because the addicted brain will go there but it is interesting to notice that CBD may be able to help reverse a little bit some of the liver damage done by the intake of alcohol CBD also reduces oxidative stress by inducing death of activated hepatic stellate cells this is again something you're seeing that autophagy oxidative stress is when you have byproducts and residual residues of things that have processes that have happened in your body and they can build up and be toxic which is why the stress part and CBD actually causes some of these cells that have gone a little wonky to be consumed to be gotten rid of it also reduces alcohol-related brain damage preventing neuronal loss by it's antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties okay when people drink one cause of brain damage is due to lack of enough thiamine because alcohol blocks thiamine uptake and results in where Nicky korzak or Korsakoff syndrome CBD doesn't seem to help with that so that's one issue but the other issue is that the ingestion of alcohol leads to systemic inflammation and CBD because of its anti-inflammatory properties does seem to reduce the inflammation and reduce the damage to the brain cells because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes CBD in stimulant disorders CBD has reversed toxicity and seizures induced by cocaine not saying again this is not like taking naltrexone or something that with opioids that is an automatic reversal but they have found that it has helped heal the body some when somebody has used cocaine and had had toxicity or seizures it reverses behavioral sensitization induced by M FET amines and it reduces motivation to self administer cocaine and meth we're speculating again that CBDs function in modulating that dopamine and keeping it from you know going wide open is what reduces motivation to self-administer because the high is just not so good it's just like CBD also increased the extinction of cocaine and amphetamine induced conditioned place preference just like I said on the last slide or the slide before because it is reducing the rewarding say reward salience of those places and of those things then what when it's administered then by administering that you're also reducing the trigger salience you're reducing the urges to go there mechanisms involved in the protective effects of CBD on addiction to psycho stimulant drugs include prevention of drug-induced neuro adaptation hopefully it's preventing by addressing that that receptor it's preventing that neuroplasticity that encourages people to move to problematic use it encourages somehow they don't know how exactly but it does encourage the eraser of aberrant drug memories so it helps with some of those for some people they say it helps with their drug dreams that they have elimination of cognitive deficits induced by psycho stimulant drugs so it helps the brain become a little bit healthier an alleviation of mental disorders that are comorbid with psychostimulant abuse you'll learn in a little while that CBD interacts on opioid serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine systems so it is impactful for just about everything in the DSM for not everything but just about cannabis and mental health disorders anxiety social anxiety depression especially depression related to anxiety when somebody's just stressed out for so long they start to develop this sense of hopelessness and helplessness all of those have shown extreme promise for treatment with CBD CBD has many additional targets within and beyond the an endocannabinoid system it's not just that one system it also activates 5ht which you remember our serotonin receptors adrenal receptors so that's your norepinephrine system and your mu opioid receptors those are your pain receptors your heroin opioid related receptors CBD interestingly has the opposite effect of THC in the prefrontal cortex which is where we have our higher-order thinking and our impulse control and in the amygdala when people take THC a lot of times it increases their respiration it increases their heart rate and it activates their amygdala it activates their stress response system CBD seems to have the opposite effect which is interesting when we get down in a few minutes to talking about the implications of treatment of PTSD with CBD CBD either as a mono therapy or added to regular antipsychotic medication improved symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with promising effects especially in early stages of the illness in terms of garden grown marijuana again it's really important to recognize that THC is a major component of your garden grown cannabis it's really there are special seeds special plants special whatever you call them hybrids that you get theoretically to produce hemp which is where the CBD oil is extracted from so garden grown cannabis may not have the same effects because it does have those higher levels of THC now remember some illnesses some conditions actually respond better to THC but we weren't talking about that in this particular presentation so I left those out but do think about the fact that CBD and THC have some opposing psychological effects in one study I didn't find a whole lot of studies on CBD and PTSD but in one study 91% of patients experienced a decrease in PTSD symptom severity as low as evidenced by lower scores on the pcl5 at 8 weeks post treatment as opposed to their initial baseline well that's pretty encouraging again we want to look at where is this coming from since the PT up since PTSD does involve hyper activation of that amay d'leh and it does involve a lot of those other the serotonin system and other things it seems like the endocannabinoid system specifically CBD helps modulate that and kind of get it back to normal I've used the analogy repeatedly of a warm bath and when people are really anxious angry stressed-out hyper vigilant it's running like running hot water wide open and when they're super calm it's like running cold water wide open and it seems like the CBD gets in there and kind of monkeys with it so it's an adequate not too much as getting through but enough is getting through Alzheimer's and dementia cannabidiol or CBD is a phyto cannabinoid which is helpful as an antioxidant to reduce oxidative stress an anti-inflammatory and an agonist of dopamine and serotonin remember antioxidants we talk about all the time we want antioxidants to prevent aging we want antioxidants to help help fight cancer we want antioxidants to help prevent the degeneration of neural pathways and development of Alzheimer's and dementia so antioxidants not only in food but also in CBD are really helpful at reducing oxidative stress Aunty means getting rid of and oxidant means those ox that oxidative stress we already talked some about CBDs anti-inflammatory properties and then remember agonist means increasing dopamine and serotonin so it increases the dopamine and serotonin systems Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are both characterized by inflammation systemically and oxidative stress CBD is also helpful in patients with epilepsy restless legs and multiple sclerosis now with restless legs that has a a lot to do with dopamine imbalances with epilepsy and multiple sclerosis the CBD generally is used in epilepsy for seizures and in multiple sclerosis for tremors CBD as opposed to THC did not negatively alter cardiovascular parameters body temperature psychomotor or psychological functions nor did it induce a catalepsy or a trance-like or seizure like state like THC does in some people it doesn't put them into this zone it really doesn't have much of a psychogenic effect at all based on his pharmacology CBD may be useful not only in Alzheimer's and dementia but also in other mental health and behavioral conditions that have symptoms such as agitation self-injury anxiety aggression like autism spectrum disorders for example so based on its pharmacology CBD may be useful for reducing agitation anxiety psychosis aggression depression pain plaque formation in the brain and oxidative stress all of those things we work with to some level everyday now CBD is not typically strong enough if you want to use that word to really help a lot with sleep unless the person is having difficulty sleeping because of their anxiety or agitation it may help there now I didn't specifically research CBT and you know sleep or CBD and insomnia but it may be helpful as an adjunctive to what the person is currently doing again CBD interacts as does THC cannabinoids interact with a whole host of medications so it's really important to with your patients if they are going to try it because some are just determined that they want to try that and get off prescriptions or whatever that they do need medical consultation other things that CBD does it helps with pain obviously inflammation is an underlying cause for pain in a lot of people autoimmune to see diseases cause systemic inflammation in the body so when people have something like Crohn's disease or fibromyalgia or you know even diabetes is associated with systemic inflammation depression interestingly enough is correlated with systemic inflammation and I have a video on the YouTube channel on leaky gut and gut health that helps explain you know how depression and stress actually can lead to systemic inflammation and vice versa how systemic inflammation can lead to depression and stress asthma now that's not typically associated with mental health issues so to speak but when people are asthmatic some people have anxiety I know my daughter when she was little she had breathing problems and she was terrified to go very far away from home she was terrified to go out hiking and do fun things because she was afraid she would have an asthma attack so there is a certain amount of agoraphobia or anxiety that can be associated with asthma especially bad asthma but that aside if somebody has asthma they found that CBD is an exceptionally potent bronchodilator so it does help open up those bronchioles so people can breathe easier and osteoporosis interestingly enough that's not really associated with inflammation but I didn't have another slide to put it on as people get older especially women as we get older and our estrogen levels change we become more susceptible to osteoporosis cannabidiol CBD as well as some other cannabinoids stimulate bone growth and may be able to help prevent osteoporosis so that's something to look at again why do we care for a mental health from a mental health perspective well because osteoporosis can be painful bone broken bones broken hips from osteoporosis can be painful and debilitating and as we if we feel ourselves getting more fragile it tends to impair our self-efficacy and impair our our mood and our outlook to answer your question Robert all CBD mixtures are not created equal CBD is not regulated by the FDA with the exception there is one drug that is used to treat seizures in epilepsy that has been fda-approved but anything you get over-the-counter is not regulated by the FDA it is also not supposed to make any claims about being able to cure or treat any diseases additionally if you get your CBD oil from acme calm and you get get it on in June and then you order again in August from Acme com same manufacturer same place same even same size jar you may not get the same potency of CBD there's also a lot of variation between producers in the actual potency of the CBD in the tincture that you're getting or the oil or whatever method you're getting it in so no all CBD products are definitely not created equal and you can't even guarantee that you're getting the same dosage even if you get it from the same supplier every single time do be aware of that it's just like all of the workout supplements and stuff that are on the market there's a lot of loosey goosey nests which is it's very frustrating and it can be very scary additionally the dosage for CBD when you go to one manufacturer they may recommend XYZ dosage you go to another manufacturer they may recommend something you know five ten times higher so the recommended dosage is all over the place or the recommended serving size they can't call it a dosage is all over the place which also means you don't know what potency in many of these studies they were very careful to either not say or give a range of the dosage that they used because you know we don't really know yet since cannabic an avid aisle is so new on the market we don't really know what the appropriate and helpful and therapeutic dosage is yet which is again why you need to get a naturopath or somebody who is very familiar with CBD involved in the process if somebody is going to be taking it so what are some of the adverse effects in toxicity and I note here that all of these symptoms can be seen in people when they take CBD at doses higher than recommended for human consumption but like I said the potency is a little bit loosey-goosey you know between suppliers and the recommended serving size varies dramatically between suppliers so the dose that is quote recommended for human consumption really hasn't been all that well established yet but the FDA has weighed in a little bit but when people take too much they can have developmental toxicity so it can impair physical and cycle development if they are still growing embryo fetal mortality and we're going to talk about that a little bit more in a minute but it actually prevents or inhibit implantation of the embryo and it can cause birth defects central nervous system inhibition so and that's the same as a lot of your depressants it can cause slow to reaction times slow breathing slower heart rate to a very bad place neurotoxicity you're too much of a good thing even though it Fioretti helps regulate a lot of different systems in the brain if you take too much just like anything else it can be toxic hepatocellular which means liver injuries and abnormalities we need to be aware that yes it can't help heal the liver but in doses that are too big it can also overwhelm the lip liver and cause problems itself spermatogenesis reduction so the development or creation of sperm is reduced so that sperm count is gonna go down male reproductive system alterations and it goes into you know the size and weight of testes and other things if you want to read about it the articles in your class hypotension so low blood pressure diarrhea vomiting and fatigue however you know I'm putting that out there so you know that CBD yes it's natural but it also can be harmful just like a lot of other natural things that are out there there are a lot of positive effects if used appropriately and it's important to just be aware and and be cognizant of this and yes Logan the seizure medicine is epidemics CBD adverse effects cannabis and CBD use is rising among pregnant women in one study an estimated 4 to 20 percent of 18 to 24 year old pregnant women were using some form of cannabis products now that included THC as well as CBD but that's a that's a lot of pregnant women CBD inhibits embryo implantation and placenta development remember they need the placenta to get the nutrients in order to develop appropriately and prenatal cannabinoid exposure not just CBD but to any of the cannabinoids potentiates the harmful effects of alcohol increasing the risk of the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and craniofacial malformations and eye defects really important to recognize that not only is CBD potentially harmful to a fetus and cannabinoids potentially harmful to a fetus we know that alcohol is potentially very harmful to a fetus when you put them together they potentiate each other so it's I mean it's even more powerful than like one plus one is two it's like one plus one is six really important that pregnant women are not drinking definitely not drinking and using CBD or cannabinoids or cannabis marijuana concurrently and preferably not using cannabinoids either so let's go down to drug reactions and there's a lot of them remember I told you that CBD interacts with just about every drug on the market hmmm well here you go let's go through this laundry list and talk about why we care the first one is sort of a easy go by guide but it doesn't cover all of them however any of your clients who are taking drugs that have a grapefruit warning on them like boosts per\u00f3n or a lot of the antipsychotics those drugs are metabolized by cyp2d6 which is inhibited by CBD so if they're taking that medication then the metabolization of those drugs may not go the way it's supposed to which means in most cases the drug levels are going to bill up to toxic levels in the system way too quickly so it's really important if there's a grapefruit warning on their drugs not to take CBD that's you know just one of those rules but that warning is not on a lot of medications steroids and corticosteroids are used for things like asthma arthritis and other inflammatory conditions we need to ask people are they taking steroids or corticosteroids when my daughter used to get sick she had she was born with lung problems and so every time she would get sick it would go to her chest and she would either develop bronchitis or pneumonia just like that and she would have to be on a nebulizer in order to reduce the inflammation in her in her lungs sometimes she would even have to take oral steroids if it got that bad why do I bring that up because some of our clients may be you know not taking any drugs at all you know any medications at all taking CBD and then they get sick and they get prescribed steroids or corticosteroids it's important for them to recognize that oh this new medication I'm taking might interact with the CBD that I'm already taking they need to let their prescribing physician or physicians know if they're taking it statins these are the drugs that people take for cholesterol most people I know unfortunately who are over the age of about 50 are on some level of statins and you know we could argue whether they need to be or not statins also have some interesting effects on mood just as a side a side effect but if somebody is taking statins CBD will interact with those CBD interacts with calcium channel blockers those are the medications you take for high blood pressure certainly don't want to be monkeying around with that remember CBD can in high enough doses can cause hypotension so if you're taking medication for your blood pressure to reduce it and then you take CBD with it guess what your blood pressure may go through the floor antihistamines interestingly enough HIV antivirals and immune modulators because the CBD is it's in and of itself a immune system modulator sometimes it works with sometimes it works against the HIV drugs and you know depending on what cocktail the person is on is really important to know the interactions I'll put all three of these together benzodiazepines which are your anti-anxiety medications antipsychotics which is like your seroquel and your house all and antidepressant medications and herbs including things like st. John's wort all interact with the gaba system the serotonin system and/or the dopamine system your antipsychotics typically are responsible for reducing dopamine levels so if somebody is taking CBD which increases dopamine you're kind of working against yourself here antidepressant medications increase serotonin and potentially dopamine and or norepinephrine CBD potentially also increases all three of those and so you may put people into a position where they are at risk of things like serotonin syndrome serotonin syndrome is deadly if people get too much serotonin it spikes their body temperature and results in tremors vomiting potentially loss of consciousness a lot of really bad stuff and it can happen after just one dose it's not something that has to do that they have to do you know for a week or two weeks or months at a time sometimes we see when we talk about serotonin syndrome a lot of times we're talking about when we're talking about serotonin and serotonin syndrome we're also talking about when people take it with antidepressants when they take two different antidepressants together or they take antidepressants and opioids which actually both increase serotonin or they take antidepressants and this is a favorite one of the teenagers dextromethorphan which is a cough suppressant a lot of teenagers for a while don't know if they're still doing it we're taking mega doses of dextromethorphan rectally in order to increase the rate of absorption and the dextromethorphan actually increases serotonin levels and they were some of them were getting so much they were developing serotonin syndrome so serotonin is really nothing to monkey around with if you don't know what you're doing like I said herbs were looking at 5ht as well 5htp as well as st. John's wort anticonvulsant like klonopin or clonazepam beta blockers another thing that is used for blood pressure proton pump inhibitors which are things like zantac and there's one that begins with a P and I can't think of it right now but you take it for stomach acid and even oral diabetic medications any of these all of these interact with CBD and it will affect the amount of circulate that certain amount of that medication circulating in your system or the absorbability or availability of it in some cases it reduces and in other cases it increases the point is to know what what the interactions are now one interesting place you can go is to drugs calm and they have an interaction checker see if I can get it to come up okay so to answer somebody else's question as well as to show you how the drug interaction thing works you put in the medication or medications that the person is taking and then it'll tell you drug interactions for this one it says statins and cannabidiol cannabidiol may cause liver problems and using it with other medications that also affect the liver such as statins may increase the risk of liver damage so that's what that's all about so that you just go to drugs calm or search for drugs calm drug interaction checker and I've used it with a lot of my clients to help them understand the side effects of some of the medications they're taking as well as to check for side effects of the medications they're taking with other things like herbs over-the-counter drugs even alcohol CBD is showing promise as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for a variety of things ranging from Alzheimer's and addiction to Parkinson's and schizophrenia I mean if you go to PubMed and I'll go there in a minute you're gonna find tons of articles in your classroom I think I have in the additional resources section I think I have about 17 articles that I cited in in this presentation there's just a plethora of information and I'm really excited that this is coming out but right now they still don't have good recommendations for dosing and even if they did if you're getting the CBD over-the-counter you can't guarantee that you're actually getting that dosage of CBD in that formulation CBD does not have the psychogenic effects that THC does however THC has been found to be more effective at addressing certain issues over-the-counter CBD is non standardized so dosages even from the same manufacturer but in different Lots may have different potency CBD interacts with most medications so it's vital to consult a physician prior to using it the dosages like I said of CBD in the literature varied widely currently there are a couple of CBD based medications that are FDA approved for the treatment of seizure disorder finally remember that CBD oils may also have traces of THC generally not over 0.3% y'all know one of my favorite things is pubmed and I can never remember the long address for it you just type in pubmed cannabidiol and we'll just do an PTSD and i guess i stumped it because it took a long time you can go over here and you can shorten the window so you only see stuff from the last two years I always have free full text checked because I like to read the actual article not just the abstract and you can set additional filters like species I always have mine checked on humans because I'm not as interested in what it did to the rats but then all of these you can you can look at of somebody asked about cannabidiol and insomnia so let's see proof of concept there so then going with just the abstract that one hasn't been done yet they're talking about what they will do result 72 adults had primary concerns of anxiety and poor sleep anxiety scores decreased in 57 patients and sleep scores improved within the first month in 48 patients but fluctuated over time and CBD was well tolerated in all but three patients so theoretically this may be something that comes out as a newer intervention that is less harmful to the brain than Anna histamines and some of the barbiturates that are currently available for insomnia something to keep your eye on now all right let's look at let's look for that see if I can find anything on the FDA on CBD yeah yeah potential harm of CBD the FDA really doesn't like CBD they want to tell you about all the scary stuff so right now like I said in the research the dosage a lot of times wasn't even noted but other times it was there was a very wide spectrum of what they were offering for it no the research studies that we looked at or that I looked at did not talk about CBD isolate full-spectrum or broad spectrum we can look at those real quick let's see it appears all of those have THC removed but in the full spectrum and broad spectrum they have some of the other cannabinoids that exist in the marijuana plant in there and you know THC is the psychoactive one so if that's what a lot of the drug tests measure for but each one of the cannabinoids has its own independent properties and usefulness and things so I can see why some people would look for a broad spectrum CBD in order to get as much benefit an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as possible without the THC but you notice neither NIDA nor stomps I had anything about that on them what isn't interestingly it appears this article on the National Institute of drug abuse is quite positive about the potential promise of cannabidiol for therapeutic use so I'll put that in here for you guys to read in-depth let me answer your question Logan let's see yes I would say Logan the I mean anything with dextromethorphan that is being taken in addition to a CBD can't have a potentiation effect and the triple triple sees themselves or dextromethorphan alone can cause can in high enough doses can lead to serotonin syndrome so it is that is one of those things that can be really scary oops No oh hush here is a video I did do on serotonin syndrome if you're in Florida and you need medical error prevention you can get CEUs for it but if you don't care about that then you know just watch the video if you're interested in learning more about serotonin syndrome and what the symptoms are are there any other questions I've really enjoyed all your questions about CBD I am still learning about it obviously along with you guys but I was I really enjoyed going through the research and yes I saw somebody else commenting I'm not sure where you're seeing the ads at there shouldn't be any ads during the during the class but unfortunately Google is creepy aware of what you do I swear sometimes they just hear what I'm saying and I'm not even looking online and I start getting fed ads about it so you probably will start seeing some ads about CBD oil one thing you can do if you want to there are some free open-source ad blocker programs my husband has them on his computer because he really hates ads to no end but you can also install those if ads bother you I usually just kind of ignore them but they are distracting for some people alrighty everybody if you have any other questions please feel free to email me at support at all CEUs com otherwise I will see you on

epilepsy or Charlotte was pleading with the government for a special prescription to license and distal cannabis oil for her son you cannot take away an antiepileptic medications you cannot stop it abruptly yeah it has to be weaned in the first done things so I'm sayin tune that chord this morning please give me back at police medication today because he needs his medication this is not anything to do with recreational but you're just silent as death warrant so please give it back he's not a doctor Philip he's a minister so he should be listening to the doctor in Canada well after the success of Charlotte's campaigning the law was changed and last week marked one year since the perception of medical cannabis was legalized in the UK but despite the change in the law many doctors are still hesitant to give out the drug and we're joined this morning by doctor Javed Abdel Moneim to separate the fact from the fiction good morning new you so first of all I guess we should understand that what what is it in this cannabis that's supposed to help medicinally well there are there are lots of compounds in cannabis it's a whole plant but the the ones that people believe are active are called cannabinoids there are two that are most important it's CBD you may have heard of that and there's another called THC now that's the one that can cause a high it can cause ill effects but CBD is the one when in combination people think could be the ticket so what is the current law in the UK well the court as you said it changed that just about a year ago law says that specialists not GPS that's the important part specialists can prescribe cannabis based medicinal products only if other treatment options have failed and if they feel there really is a benefit so there must be NHS guidelines in place for prescribing cannabis what do they say yes now the guidelines are there the guidelines are very clear medicinal cannabis can be prescribed only when clear published evidence of benefits exists and other treatment options have been exhausted now those are in draft but that's pretty clear it makes it very very difficult to for example you're certainly not going to get it from your GP right but you've you visit this is the cannabis with the THC in it the because CBD you can you can you can buy absolutely it's available over-the-counter CBD that's that's deregulated in that sense and THC is still the part that's illegal but the you know the evidence over which works in what combination from which diseases is that is what's still not why aren't the doctors prescribe why is it not being prescribed it's a combination of things firstly that guidance it's pretty clear if you if you haven't exhausted other treatments you shouldn't be doing this secondly it called for more evidence there really isn't enough evidence out there that's utterly clear about one agent versus another and thirdly its infrastructure for example Billy had it prescribed but it cost him a thousand pounds a month the import licenses the customs the the protocols for moving the substances into the UK just aren't that so it sounds like the evidence in the infrastructure needs to catch up really with what the laws say and the THC but just explain why is that so helpful what is what what is it so there you go all it's a THC III say it as an acronym it's the high causa that's not necessarily as helpful it's the CBD that is and no one knows how or why and it's certainly the CBD that has more suggestion of help in chronic pain in epilepsy that's difficult to treat and so forth but there are also people who wish that both should be used in combination you say there is a lack of evidence is there evidence ongoing are we actually looking at this now because it's essentially it's a natural product absolutely and it's been around for thousands of years so there was a call for evidence into eight research areas there is soon to be announced potentially a trial a project looking at about 20,000 patients to follow them over the next two years and that's been brought about by a group of patient advocates a certain charity and actually a cannabis medicine or cannabis production company and and and the NHS group that looks over this has said it would be great to have this evidence so watch this space and is that currently sort of a range of conditions that we know that it's helpful for absolutely I mean it's actually licensed in the NHS for use in after chemotherapy it's also licensed for severe epilepsy but again this is only when other usually licensed medicines have been exhausted and the patients aren't getting the benefit from what's already around and more commonly used now people who buy the CBD over-the-counter they say it's useful for sleep for anxiety for potentially for appetite people use it as creams for their skin a whole host of myriad of ailments but that's slightly different that over-the-counter sort of you do they work let me know they are they good the evidence just isn't there but does that mean they don't work I mean cuz there's a lot of online evidence of sort of testimonial where people will say oh my god this has changed my life so it's that only count that I will listen I'm I'm I'm listen if it's CBD not known to cause harm right if it works for you placebo or otherwise I'm quite happy because it can get very expensive but I mean it depends sort of the the what you're buying and how much is in it and this that and the other because it varies and I think that's the problem that people find they're going doing well I don't know what's right for me I don't want to buy exactly and the over-the-counter CBD is actually only a food regulation type item so that isn't thoroughly controlled like a medicine sometimes you don't even know what's in the bottle to you mention that it's this is this has been ongoing for thousands of years people have taken cannabis for ailments for obviously for other reasons why is it taking so long for this and there there are mums and dads desperately concerned about their children why is it taking so long I think there's a social cultural eminent element doctors just aren't used to prescribing this one too the evidence just isn't there the last guidance that came out in August really did almost put a hold on it but that's going to deliver potentially next week they'll finalize the guidance I don't think it'll change much extremely upset about I'd be happy to be wrong yeah thank you thank you I'm coming in today you", "YHWOpgRz-V4": "it's a health condition that affects one in seven people in the UK and this week my next guest has me at headlines after revealing she used cannabis oil to help cure her migraines on TV presenter Jenny Powell joins us now alongside dr. Hillary and Johnny I mean these were debilitating migraines this was taking days out of every single month for you we just couldn't leave the house yeah it's interesting because it's only very much later on in life for me sort of mid forties when I when I discovered that I was actually suffering from the first of I just thought was a really bad headache or a virus and I remember I was actually filming it was freezing cold I was about 46 bit stressed and it was that time of the month and I just had this awful searing headache I felt sick and actually for the first time ever thought can't work and I had to ask if I could just sit down for a while and start working and since then sort of on a sort of regular basis normally I think for doing my hormones and when my periods start I've just had this awful migraine where sometimes three to four days I just can't can't function can't you know can't make tea for everyone can't do the school around can't go to work and it's something that I didn't really I never thought about it you know with people say I've got a migrant that always she's just got a headache you know but why did you have to lie down you know what why is it so dramatic because you look fine but actually and it changes your character I've been really sort of disgruntled and snappy and you know I just I want to talk to anyone I'm actually not held to live with and it was held to go through as well and had you been to the GP there and and gone down there yes tried various kind of mini yeah I'm not great at popping pills I'm all for being preventative and saying but why am I getting them you know what can I do to prevent them rather than right well every month I've got to have this this stack of pills to stop me suffering so much so you know for me that there was sort of like as a safety box it was you know where I'd have these pills there is sumatriptan yeah which kind of worked but I'm not happy with that really I'd rather find out why I'm getting it yeah and what I can do about it or May a more natural way of getting over it and this is then how the the cannabis oil can abide it with your partner actually suggested it yes yes my other half Martin he sort of researches a lot into system well first of all from nutrition but authored to health and sort of holistic ways of looking after yourself and it was a friend of his who actually was epileptic and she's done a lot of due diligence with it and discovered that it helped her I'm just saying this he's all for everybody's different you know I'm not an expert but you know I started to read up on things and discovered that you know for headaches it could help so I tried and it's been like three four months and I haven't had a migraine which for me is life-changing really yes and it could very well be the placebo effect who knows Hillary but where where do you stand on this because if you're saying you've got three or four months there with like this terrible migraine what Jenny describes really well is menstrual migraine and this is very common so many women in the days leading up to their period and during their period they can get migraines on a frequent basis and part of the reason for that is is a falling off of Eastern and levels just before a period and a rise in chemicals called prostaglandins which can cause inflammation and pain and and normally we treat those we can treat those with Eastridge n' just before the period we treat them with with medicines that can stop the inflammation and that would be the traditional way forward now there's huge hype at the moment about CBD products as sold as health supplements legally in this country things everyone's jumping on the bandwagon and you really don't know what you're buying so some will contain a lot more CBD than other products which may have hardly any and there is research done it being done on how therapeutic CBD can be in things like neurological conditions headaches migraines anxiety depression a lot of works being done but we don't yet know how effective CBD is and what concentration you need yes you can buy it provided it satisfies all the safety and sort of regulatory necessities but you don't know what you're buying and some of it can be really expensive now it's worth trying and you've tried it and it seems to work for you and that's fine what it doesn't have in its THC which is the psychoactive chemical that you're not getting a high but you are getting some pain release with an awful lot of people don't quite know what is that you hear they're trying a health supply which is legal cannabis is a Class B drug and it's still illegal to to use and possess and supply so you know you've got to be there is a big distinction this CBD doesn't contain the THC which which has this that gives you the high is the psychoactive and activity but it may be that for some people when they use a decent concentration of CBD does give them relief against pain and some people even think it could be good for conditions like Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety and depression yeah just drops I just take her you know you sort of work up to what sort of works for you but for me just a couple of drops underneath the tongue for about 60 90 seconds and I do it twice a day but like I say you know it works for me I think and I've been very careful I've done the due diligence on what I've got a sort of certified organic non sort of toxic drops that I use from hemp so you know you have to you have to go out there and do the research yeah but it is tricky because it's you know it's very expensive as well and if you get the wrong one you know and there are plenty you can buy online which will have more concentration and others you can buy and health food shops might have very very little if any you know so just be careful and do you diligently it's a waste of money otherwise you", "fqNfGj8jwFY": "arthritis is a very potentially debilitating condition it affects millions of Canadians and there's actually a lot of different forms of arthritis the most common form that most of us think of when we hear the word arthritis is osteoarthritis and so that is typically the wear and tear that most people eventually especially if they live long enough will experience on their joints and that can be arthritis of the shoulders the knees the hands and that's just your general wear and tear and what people who experience this type of arthritis what they usually complain of is that sometimes they have a mild amount of stiffness but as the day gets on and they start to use those joints the inflammation starts to get worse and the pain starts to get worse another form of arthritis though that a lot of people don't typically talk about is inflammatory arthritis and so you can consider this as a slightly more severe form of arthritis where in addition to the inflammation it's actually your immune system is kind of attacking your joints regardless if you have osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis one of the main goals is managing pain and so when it comes to pain management you're stuck with anti-inflammatories which are your advils or your naproxen of the world tylenol or opioid painkillers and sometimes steroid injections work but if you have multiple joints it's hard to inject steroids all over the body nonetheless cannabinoids have become extremely popular and the arthritis society here in Canada they mentioned that almost one in two of their members reports using cannabis for arthritis it's typically osteoarthritis that patients are using cannabis for but what we're seeing in the clinic is that this is a huge burden to society and a huge number of referrals coming in come for arthritis a lot of the patients will use high CBDs typically and what they become back and report is that their joints feel a little bit more fluid they're having a reduction in the nation and they feel like their functioning has improved some patients will use a little bit more THC but it's usually in the evening where the pain will affect their ability to sleep so they'll use a little bit more THC and that will help them sleep and sleep is really important to managing your mental health and if you're in a chronic stress state then your pain is also going to be worse the next day we were actually the first health charity to have focused call on medical cannabis to understand what impact it has on arthritis patients but coupled with that if something is being used as a medicine we think that it should be treated as such so things like it needs to be taken in the context of a health care provider making sure that it's monitored properly but also people should have access to medical cannabis the same way they have access to their other medications so right now people actually can only obtain medical cannabis through mail order as one example which could be challenging unlike other medications you would pay tax on medical cannabis which is not something that we expect or is true for any other medication so their number of things that we think that if something is being used properly as a medicine it should be treated as such and we also know that many people who are authorized to use medical cannabis are actually taking it for arthritis so in that context we've heard a lot from arthritis patients about what medical cannabis the impact that it has on their disease most importantly we want to make sure that at the arthritis society we're trying to speak on behalf of patients and patient experiences and for something that's been authorized for almost twenty years now we hope that people can have access to medical cannabis in the way that they should but you know really emphasizing that there is so much to learn and we don't want to jump to conclusions but we want to make sure that we're paying close attention to medical cannabis and giving it the attention and resources that we think it

we're going to talk about how to make our cannabis oil which we made last week on the video link that down below we're gonna talk about how to make this into an awesome healing hopefully pain relieving salve so or a cream or a balm it's super easy to do at home and I'm going to show you how to do it right now my name is Andrea I'm a cannabis wellness coach for moms I help moms who are really struggling with just how tough life can be sometimes after you have kids and you had no idea it was gonna be that rough and you know that there's a better life but you're not like entirely sure how to get there that's where I come in I help you use cannabis exactly the way that you need to for your day in your life and I walk you through a bunch of other wellness practices that you can implement so that when you graduate my program you're living a much much better life than you are now that's the point so if that sounds like it would float your boat reach out to me at Rubio cannabis calm alright so I didn't talk about what we need today so first of all we have our half cup of cannabis oil that we did last time you can see that it's not liquid it's our live in Canada and it's cold here already so it solidifies so 1/2 a cup of your infused oil and then these are the basics you can go nuts on scythes and add like a whole bunch of different oils and combinations of things I went to my cannabis coach colleague who is the bomb making this stuff I he doesn't like 9,000 times a day and then we also have somebody in our group who makes this stuff for a living so I asked them how to do it like this most simple and easy way to say you and me all the googling so here we go this is cacao butter or cocoa butter I think people say it both ways it's basically the oil that they get from the cocoa bean and it feels amazing I was just playing around with that this is beeswax and this is shea butter so you can get those just out of your local health food store I'm sure amazon also sells them you're also need a tablespoon or if you're fancy then I prefer to use a scale because it's really actually hard to get a table actually gonna add it to my income I stopped today because this is for somebody else and I don't know if you want to smell like peppermint but you can add all those oils as well and then you're gonna need a double boiler or I think I'm just gonna do it right in here so I'm gonna get set up in the kitchen and we'll see you there all right so we're ready to go I have my infused oil the coconut oil that I just warmed up in the microwave I'm just gonna try to infuse it right in here but it's not gonna work and then I've created a double boiler here so that just means that you have a little bit of water in the bottom so that it reaches the bottom of the second pan and you put the second pin in and then pour your ingredients in and the reason that we do a double boiler is so that you don't you don't want to burn your oil you don't wanna get your oil to the point where it's smoking because that's bad so I'm just gonna add in my infuse my cannabis infused oil and then I ended up really having to shave the beeswax because it was so hard so this is beeswax here on top and then the shea butter and the cocoa butter the cacao butter so you put this all together this takes a little while you want to put it over like don't put a rolling boil on it or anything and when this all combines together then you're done so I'm gonna let this melt away and I'll show you what it's like at the end and just so you know I'll have all the instructions for this as well in a link down below not sure if I remember to tell you but there's an ounce or two tablespoons of each of the three other ingredients that we added in here so but that links down below so make sure you grab that so that you don't need to watch the video every time you want to make this okay so everything has melted all together you can see that the liquid like you can see through the liquid now so I'm just gonna pour it back into my mason jar I happen to have one of these for canning which makes this a whole bunch easier there we go this takes about a half an hour to set up so obviously we wait because it's gonna be quite warm and then you can apply this topically which means apply it to your skin so if you had sore hands or a sore back or sore knees this would be perfect for it there's absolutely no way for the THC in here to get you high at all so there's no worry about that and because this is a one-to-one straight it has CBD and THC in it then it will help with pain on both friends and inflammation so yeah this is gonna set up and I'm gonna send it off to the client and see what he thinks and we'll go from there thanks so much for watching this week's video I post new videos every Saturday I'd love if you subscribed and hit like if you liked it and if there's anything else that you would like to learn about please let me know and I just wanted to show you the final product it's quite creamy as you can see and when you wrap it on it takes a little bit to rub into your skin but it feels fantastic because of all the great additives that we added into it and then it absorbs quite well so I'm excited to pass this on to my client and see if it will help with his back pain if you have any questions please just reach out and I can answer them in the chat Thanks", "2rDTmvp1Bmc": "is used widely in textiles medicine and food but what is the difference between it and marijuana here to answer that question please welcome medical doctor and health coach dr. Elaine chin and naturopathic doctor and I mean my goodness we're hearing CBD THC we're hearing it all the time so it's nice for us to just sit down and get a definition of the difference between hemp and marijuana so I'll start with you doc what's the difference well definitely it's all confusing because you've got common names and then you've got scientific names so cannabis is a scientific name and marijuana and hemp is what we call common names okay so I think let's just leave it that because we're not doing biology 101 today okay and both of these plants or all these cannabis plants produce a combination of THC or CBD and they're the active ingredients that we get the stimulation or the relaxation effects okay so there's a difference though between the CBD and the THC and what would that difference be well one is what we call psychoactive such as the tea tea and one would say CBD is generally the one that's not addictive and is calming and you'd never get really high on that you wouldn't okay but you might from the THC you technically you do let's talk about how hemp impacts our bodies and I'm gonna throw this one to you Elizabeth great so as Elaine mentioned both the hemp and the cannabis the marijuana they all contain cannabinoids so you've got your THC and hemp it's very low less than 0.3% so there's none of the psychoactive effects your body also makes its own set of cannabinoids to bind to your brain and to different receptors in your body so they have the effect of regulating hormones and of maintaining overall body balance or homeostasis okay so if people are concerned with things like nausea inflammation chronic pain then hemp can be a really great solution that doesn't have any other psychoactive effects okay interesting so I actually I got you took a swab from me dr. Chynn just the cheek swab and it was you know it was very easy in order to give me an exam and to test me to see what the impact would be of CBD right CBD and THC okay so we got my exam results everybody and they were incredibly boring what did it say and we're being truthful here yeah I've got the right here she's boring because she's normal yeah yeah it's like cannot be normal metabolizer normal metabolizer average average and average this would have killed me in grade six what that fundamentally means is that if I gave you a dose regardless of it's a THC CBD combination or one or just the other for different reasons I would give you the normal standard dose and I would expect a normal metabolism rate and a normal effect rate of how you break down your THC or CBD okay and then we also looked at the psychoactive our anxiety side effect risk factors for you yeah you don't have it yeah and equally important you don't have the effects of a THC dependency risk factor the reason why you would administer or take part in an exam like that would be in order to see how you're going to take on and metabolize it something like CBD or th there's a lot of patients are wondering this is right for me so now we're gonna bring slides into this conversation to say if you're not sure let's look at your genetic predispositions and we also in our office measures something called neurotransmitters which are your brain chemicals okay is the impact of THC and CBD so we'll know what to give you more or less of okay do you have is there such thing as like an average dose that you would start out with if someone had average results yes so most prescribing physicians will start at the lowest dose and titrate you up just to be careful another thing worth mentioning is the the form that you take it in so if you're taking it sublingually under your tongue or in your mouth you're absorbing up to up to a hundred percent more than if you're taking it orally and you're actually ingesting or eating it the potency in eating something is vastly reduced so the four makes it each difference so what are the main benefits do you think Elizabeth like why would people turn to a CBD or a THC or hemp products yeah the main benefits are I mean all the cannabinoids have different profiles and so the product that you're getting is dependent upon the cannabinoid and also another class of molecules called terpenes upon the profile of those but the main benefits are they're anti-inflammatory they could help with sleep with mood with brain conditions those are the big ones and also gut health nausea you know cachexia or difficulty with weight loss around cancer there's all kinds of benefits and more being released as the data comes out any warnings that people should be aware of before they decide that they want to go pursue this as a you know as a remedy i would say go to a physician that prescribes cannabis rather than just go to a recreational snoring like wing it right make sure you with a doctor they know what they're doing they've done this before yeah and I understand a lot of people are saying well my family doctor is dismissing it it's only because I think they haven't got that time yet to kind of do the research do the information so but some of it is prescribing anything else we should know give it a go if traditional medical drugs aren't working for you okay good that's good information thank you for clarifying a lot of that for us both of you", "K-ZCzmZLSrc": "[Music] I'm Ian Mitchell I'm an emergency physician in Calais British Columbia at the royal inland hospital I'm also an associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia and locally I'm a clinician at the can solve clinic today I'm gonna be talking of a tale of two drugs those drugs are THC and gabapentin we're talking about their history how they've been used their research basis and why physicians feel that those two drugs are so very different and should be treated so different I'd like to begin with some history in the history of cannabis begins millennia ago cannabis is one of the oldest domesticated plants in the world going back it's used in to ancient China and Egypt in the Western world we found out about cannabis through India where physicians brought back cannabis to be used in North America what was used for over a hundred years by some of the best known physicians in the English world including Sir William Osler who believed that cannabis was the best treatment available for migraines at that time Canadian drug companies fought amongst each other over who provided the best quality cannabis to Canadian physicians and patients cannabis was criminalized in 1923 in Canada for reasons that are still unclear the history of gabapentin is much more modern gabapentin was invented in 1974 by drug company called parke-davis parke-davis as well as distributing cocaine and cannabis also invented pcp ketamine and gabapentin ria the party people love drug companies gabapentin was approved for sale in 1993 for the treatment of seizure disorders we look at the mechanism behind these two drugs cannabis affects the endocannabinoid system we all have a system within our body that responds to cannabis and also responds to chemicals within our body that are similar to cannabis these chemicals called anokhin I'm annoyed helped to regulate our mood or sleep and our appetite on the other hand gabapentin works in a different system it was initially designed to work on gaba receptors however lingo research shows it actually affected calcium channels on nerve terminals looking at the research base of these two therapies we find that the research that spend on cannabis is overwhelmingly looking at harms over 90% of the research money that was ever spent was focused while looking at the harms of cannabis very little was spent looking at benefits part of the difficulty in studying cannabis is there is no supply of research cannabis in America to look at the benefits the government give you as much cannabis as you want to study the harms but if you're looking to study the benefits of cannabis you are not allowed to have any that's recently been reversed however the cannabis that the government has been sending to researchers has been of low quality and containing mold and has been unable to be used in research studies ken is not much different in Canada red tape and hurdles mean it is more difficult to study cannabis in Canada than it is to study heroin turning back to gabapentin we can look at the research in gabapentin as being part of a criminal enterprise and that really focus on a physician called dr. scott rubin who's incarcerated for falsifying data in research studies he played a big part in the researching of gabapentin and its uptake by physicians Pfizer the drug company marketing gabapentin realized that there was little money to be made in just the seizure management aspect of gabapentin so they sent sales people out to doctors offices to convince them to use it for many other conditions in populations that had never been approved for children old people as a result gap in and a huge uptake among physicians but ultimately Pfizer had to pay out the largest consumer fight in history four hundred thirty million dollars for their fraudulent Mis marketing activities we find that this pattern continues however with industry paid physicians still be much more likely to prescribe gabapentin looking at what effects these medications have on people both gabapentin and cannabis they have a similar side-effect profile their side effects include dizziness sedation coordination problems cognitive impairment people are often very much more concerned about the mental health aspects of cannabis and how there are some adverse effects associated in that way particularly with schizophrenia what we understand is there is an association with cannabis and schizophrenia if people start using cannabis at a very young age and they are prone to getting schizophrenia their symptoms may come out earlier and be more severe but it does not appear that cannabis by itself can make someone schizophrenic it can only affect people who are already vulnerable to condition there's also the myth of the amotivational syndrome this is an idea that stoners sit around all the time and are very lazy and that just hasn't been borne out by research turning back to gabapentin we find that we have new concerns about mental health and gabapentin from recent research we know that it increases suicidal ideation and that's most often in people between the ages of 15 and 24 people who are much more prone to be suicidal already it's also impairing for driving gabapentin is both drugs can be abused both cannabis and gabapentin we know from older research that approximately 1 in 9 people who use cannabis recreationally may become dependent on it although this is based on old figures and may not be reflective of current conditions physicians were told that gabapentin was not addictive was not abusable and this of course is not the case there is a large illicit market for gabapentin particularly in prison it helps to make the effects of opiates more prominent unfortunate also helps to increase the rate of death associated opiate overdose there is a withdrawal symptom from gabapentin that is not as severe as with alcohol but is still unpleasant and no one should ever stop gabapentin cold turkey because of this withdrawal syndrome cannabis has been very heavy rake heavily regulated since 1923 was made illegal it was made partially GLE in 2001 in Canada with the advent of medical cannabis and we had full legalization of cannabis in 2018 gabapentin remains unrestricted in canada available by prescription it does not require triplicate as opiates do or other addictive medications do gallopin has been rescheduled in the United Kingdom due to epidemic of misuse the Canadian Medical Association the standard for Canadian physicians holds that the evidence is insufficient to use cannabis for neuropathic pain they are supportive of gabapentin and that certain research have called them out on this saying there have been overly cautious about cannabis per se the CMA has been somewhat silent about gabapentin their journal the Canadian Medical Association Journal has articles noting the abuse the over prescribing and the lack of efficacy of gabapentin but the Cana Medical Association at this point has no moves to restrict physician prescribing of gabapentin of note there is no Sunshine Act in Canada so it is difficult to know who is getting paid by companies to help prescribe - gabapentin moving on to some myths there are a rich mythology around cannabis first being that it is common to have cannabis that has been contaminated with fentanyl this has never been proved to be true there's no confirmed samples of cannabis with fentanyl in it fentanyl is actually destroyed if people smoke it in a joint that has to be smoked in a different way off aluminum foil there's also the terms indica and sativa that are still commonly used at one point this represented difference between the two types of plants and Petacchi that type of effect they would have on people however over the last few decades hybridization amongst these plants has rendered these distinctions meaningless and is no longer possible to look at a name to look at a label and tell what is in that plant or what the effect it's gonna have on a person myths around gabapentin are few there was a gentleman in the UK who was claiming that after taking gabapentin he became gay I haven't read any research studies supporting that so far looking at the clinical indications for these medications for cannabis we have indications for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting for spasticity for PTSD and for chronic pain but many people have raised concerns about cannabis being a panacea and applied to every condition out there and we hear this especially for physicians but just for comparison I'd like to read off the indications for gabapentin and what people are prescribing that form and we find the doctors are prescribing gabapentin for acute pain chronic pain post-operative pain neuropathic pain they're prescribed for tremors seizures and muscle cramps they're prescribing for depression mania herpes zoster tardive dyskinesia restless leg syndrome fibromyalgia cancer diabetic neuropathy interstitial cystitis arthritis anxiety pancreatitis chronic cough occipital neuralgia migraine bipolar disease drug dependency alcoholism alcohol at all opiate withdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal doesn't work for all these things the evidence just isn't there it's unclear whether gabapentin works for much of anything however we've seen a tremendous rise of gabapentin and that's come from large amounts of pharmaceutical money being used to promote the drug it's being heavily up take it because now physicians are much more concerned about prescribing opiates or restricted by their college for prescribing opiates for their patients so they have to turn to an alternative the fact that it may not work very well sinks to the bottom there's a perception of safety with gabapentin that is really not true we now know much more about its side effects and its impairment risks there's been a tendency of physicians to say well if the gabapentin is working is not working for you that we should increase the dose and there's been many studies showing that increase in the dose does not add to any pain relief but only increase the side-effects nonetheless this is a very common prescribing pattern within British Columbia so if we look at the protocols for treating neuropathic pain which is one of the main reasons that gavin pensions around gabapentin is certainly high up on the list when we look at an algorithm for managing neuropathic pain that comes from your pain family physicians they also include opiate analgesics in tramadol which are terrible drugs for neuropathic pain and have significant side-effects Tanna monoids only appear as a third line agent unfortunately if you look at evidence to support gabapentin which is the first-line agent I quote from a study here there is moderate to high quality evidence that anticonvulsants are ineffective for the treatment of low back pain or lumbar radicular pain there is high-quality evidence that gabapentin oiz have a higher risk for adverse events these are medications that do not work well for the indications they are prescribed and they have significant side-effects and yet they are among the most commonly prescribed pain medications from physicians today so this brings us now to a state of reality pain and evidence-based medicine we have limited evidence-based medicine about cannabis because for many decades we weren't allowed to do the research and we're in a research deficit so we don't know how well cannabis works for many conditions on the other hand with gabapentin it's been researched thoroughly and what we're finding is that it has been well researched enough to know that it does not work for most conditions as prescribed for and it has significant harms so there are many patients with chronic pain and some of them will be helped by gabapentin but is a very small number and certain does not justify the number of prescriptions being written for this medication there are very few prescriptions written for cannabis because physicians shy away from this from lack of knowledge but it can certainly be an effective medication for patients and if we move on to a summary from one of the gabapentin studies it reads even absent clinical trial trial data it is possible that drug X may help some patients who have clinical features of neuropathic pain in the same way that not every patient responds to medication with proven eck efficacy for the condition there are some patients who may respond to medications even though efficacy was not demonstrated in a clinical trial the problem is that throws out evidence-based medicine says you shouldn't pay attention to studies I think you should pay attention to studies but the studies haven't been done for cannabis with this equipoise and what we understand certainly some patients are going to be helped by gabapentin and it doesn't mean that needs to go away but it needs to be far more restricted than what it is and physicians need to consider the cannabis with a similar side effect profile and more effect on neuropathic pain maybe a more appropriate selection for these patients and they should consider where the research comes from and the bias behind these both of these medications thank you", "GcLpuOoOS8E": "[Music] it's not uncommon when people come in for them to describe to us that they've been experiencing atypical behavior acting in ways that aren't like themselves and this is not so uncommon with post-traumatic stress disorder [Music] and people with post-traumatic stress symptoms often attempt to take care of their problem on their own people drink they use substances they misuse substances as a way of coping seven to eight percent of the general population each year are affected by post-traumatic stress disorder or ptsd it manifests itself after an individual goes to a shocking stressful or for lack of a better term a traumatic experience leaving an individual in a very disturbed state the disorder can affect people of all ages and is commonly seen in military veterans victims of sexual assault or abuse and even witnesses of terror attacks and natural disasters symptoms of ptsd can begin to overcome an individual three months after the traumatic event and these include flashbacks where you relive the event over and over while even feeling the physical symptoms such as the racing heart and sweating [Music] individuals with ptsd can have difficulty falling asleep difficulty concentrating and can feel socially isolated develop extreme anxiety while also having depression within the brain the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex are the primary regions that are affected by ptsd while the neurochemicals cortisol and norepinephrine which are responsible for the stress response also tend to show increased activity in ptsd patients imagine the worst possible day of your life now imagine reliving that moment over and over and over and over again and with each passing moment the fear that it may happen again only grows greater for a lot of ptsd patients they only see one solution one effective way to cope with their problem and this leads us to substance abuse in recent years ptsd has been shown to have a link with substance use disorder in which individuals frequently use these substances to cope with their struggles but today we'll be only focusing our attention to one of these drugs cannabis or more commonly known as marijuana so what is cannabis cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can be smoked ate in an edible form and drank in liquid form the psychoactive substance within cannabis is known as thc also known as tetrohydrocannable this is a molecule that is responsible for eliciting the euphoric effects that it is known for cbd is another major component of cannabis however it is not relevant to the studies we will be examining so when canvas is ingested it causes the brain to release dopamine which is the reward chemical for our body and this is the fundamental mechanism by which cannabis affects our brain body and mental state so now we've talked about ptsd and we've talked about cannabis but how do they relate to one another we'll take a look at two studies that examine the effects of cannabis on ptsd does it help or does it hurt the symptoms in a study conducted in 2014 researchers examined 2 276 military veterans who were diagnosed with ptsd their findings were astonishing following an analysis of their symptoms they found that those military veterans that never used cannabis had the lowest level of ptsd symptoms such as depression anxiety and sleeplessness however it is interesting that those who started smoking cannabis following ptsd diagnosis saw a rise in violent behaviors in contrast those who stopped smoking marijuana also saw a decrease in certain ptsd symptoms [Music] in a more recent study conducted in 2020 404 individuals with ptsd were put on a medical marijuana regiment in which they inhaled cannabis these individuals tracked their symptoms on an app for 31 months and had a total of 11 000 responses they tracked symptoms such as intrusive thoughts flashbacks irritability anxiety along with many others after analyzing the results the researchers concluded that there was a 50 percent decrease in all ptsd symptoms immediately after using marijuana like all studies there are some limitations there needs to be more controlled research so we can truly understand the effects this is a new and advancing field and it's necessary to explore all avenues to see how cannabis can improve or deteriorate our mental health now where does this leave us can we say for certain that cannabis cures ptsd definitely not but we can certainly also not rule it out as a potential treatment what we can say though is that for certain individuals cannabis does prove to lessen the severity of their symptoms while for others it may increase them like any medication before taking any course of action it is best to consult your doctor and understand both the possible benefits and the risks this is demystifying medicine presenting ptsd in cannabis help or hurt you", "WCZkmm2w3UM": "[Music] we don't know that much right now especially compared to what we know regarding the effects on the brain lungs and heart for example but research on the effects of cannabis on kidney function is largely limited to a few retrospective cohort studies those studies have included smoked recreational cannabis either in healthy people or they've evaluated any lifetime use among people with kidney disease so there are some differences between recreational benefits and medicinal cannabis such as the route of administration uh the dose the frequency of use and all of these can have different effects on long-term outcomes so these studies did not demonstrate any association between cannabis use and the development or progression of kidney disease because of this though in order to answer this question we conducted a study among people at high risk for kidney disease and we did demonstrate an association between chronic cannabis use and a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate among people with kidney disease we presented this research at kidney with 2018 and the uh we're planning to submit the manuscript for publication shortly so many people use cannabis to treat a variety of ailments among people living with kidney disease it's estimated that about one quarter to one half of patients experience chronic symptoms such as pain nausea anorexia sleep disturbance anxiety and depression and several of these are approved indications for medical cannabis uh in across the united states in various states additionally anxiety depression and insomnia are the most common psychiatric conditions that people self-treat with cannabis so there's evidence supporting the use of cannabis in the in patient populations without kidney disease for treating several of these symptoms most of the evidence is focused on chronic pain nausea and anorexia or loss of appetite additionally many patients living with kidney disease and those on dialysis experience substantial chronic being it's estimated up to 50 percent of patients can experience chronic pain now over 60 percent of dialysis patients have received at least one opiate prescription annually and approximately 20 of dialysis patients take prescription opiates chronically but we know that the short-term and chronic use of of opiates are associated with increased morbidity and mortality uh among people with kidney disease so cannabis could have a potential therapeutic role in the pain management among these patients and in fact the national academies concluded that there's substantial evidence for the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic pain while several meta-analyses and systematic reviews on cannabis use including the prescription cannabinoids have given some mixed results for treating chronic pain well one thing that i could think of is that you know cannabis consumers are no longer the stereotypical lazy stoner the prevalence of cannabis use in the united states and worldwide has increased considerably over the last decade but particularly among people over the age of 50 and even more so over the age of 65 and and this patient population is enriched with chronic illness including chronic kidney disease we know that adults with chronic medical conditions are more likely to consume cannabis than healthy individuals however we don't really know the long-term health effects of cannabis use on some of these conditions so it's that much more important to understand its impact on kidney disease", "lSWq35pDZNw": "welcome to shades of

those that are trying to help each will share their unique shade of migraine tara is committed to the goal of transforming the lives of those suffering from migraine by creating solutions to reinvent the migraine paradigm by placing people at the center of everything they do you can visit www.imtcva.org Institute gives us scientific and practical information about the use of cannabis or marijuana for treating migraine originally geared towards physicians this 20-minute presentation is chock-full of information helpful for anyone using or contemplating using cannabinoids to treat their migraine disease or chronic pain Thank You Ric for inviting me here it's been a pleasure to be part of this organization it's my second time participating and you know today I'm gonna talk about a topic that's fun but yet it's also a little controversial I grew up in the 80s so it's thinking about you know giving the title hope with dope but then I thought about stigma and decided to keep it to keep it to just cannabinoids so today I'm going to talk about criminology I'm going to talk about pharmacology I'm gonna talk about fetish pathogenesis I'm going to talk about some clinical research and as well in particular Rick asked me to talk about physician or clinician expectations and also patient expectations and they're going to briefly mention some cutting-edge research that we're doing at dent which has a large - large practice to begin with but we also are involved in medical marijuana or cannabis so basic terminology marijuana is frequently you know thought of to be a synonym for cannabis but it's not the terms are different cannabis is the botanical term for the hemp plant that contains cannabis sativa cannabis sativa is different from cannabis indica so cannabis sativa is a tall lastly branched with long and narrow leaves there's a picture of it there on the bottom right corner this provides more of the high feeling the energetic buzz feeling it's up till uplifting feeling the ratio of THC to CBD is it has more of a THC component versus CBD I'm going to explain those molecules in a second and recreational users users typically seek this train to get more of the high feeling cannabis indica comes from India it was found there in the Hindu Kush mountain range as well these are short conical dense branches with broad leaves provides more of a stoned feeling and people also use it for sedation pain relief and anxiety benefits as well there's a slightly different THC to CBD ratio and typically medical users prefer this strained over the other one in terms of history it's been around for thousands of years it's actually even mentioned in the Ebers papyrus with some use for pain related disorders but one of the earliest known use has been found in China and plant stems were used for ropes and linen flower seeds especially the resin can be sort of extracted to give psychoactive chemical properties termed cannabinoids so the different types of cannabinoids endocannabinoids are endogenous these are lipid based neurotransmitters one of the first discovered was an and amide and I'm gonna mention that a little bit later and when we talk about pathogenesis phyto cannabinoids these are the ones listed here these are come from more of a natural base and then synthetic cannabinoids either FDA approves these two in particular are FDA approved for the treatment of nausea and and severe nausea shows associated with cancer related pains these synthetic cannabinoids that are FDA approved have more of a regulation in terms of the actual compound itself versus the synthetic that are out on the street these are manufactured by chemists chemists and their chemical structure has changed there have been some warnings associated with that which I'm going to touch on a little bit later on so there are synthetic cannabinoids that are approved by FDA and then there are other ones that people buy online and their structures actually modified they are not coming from natural plants so just to know some of that terminology in terms of the pharmacology tetrahydrocannabinol was first identified in 1964 by Mechelen and by smoking in one cigarette or joint you can contain about 0.5 to 1 gram of cannabis only about 20% is absorbed in the lungs it's rapidly metabolized in the liver you can also have because of its solubility you can have accumulation and fat taking place that's why you can even detect it in the urine two weeks down the line as well oral consumption can produce prolonged but poor absorption so some people who may try something orally and don't feel the effect will keep eating and then later on they just are completely wiped out because the delayed effect more on pharmacology so there's several primary cannabinoids from cannabis so there's cannabidiol cbn caneta i'm sorry a cannabinol cannabidiol which is CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol so THC has more of the psychoactive property CBN is about one tenth of the psychoactive property as THC and CBD has no real psychoactive property adverse effects of marijuana so on the left you can see some of the short-term effects which include memory impairment motor coordination altered judgment motor vehicle accidents sometimes even psychosis and paranoia on the right side it's somewhat controversial it's debatable so I'm not going to really delve in too much into that that area is still controversial in terms of long-term effects of heavy use who uses marijuana there are patients people who use it for recreational they also use it for medical reasons and some use it for both as well now what's in marijuana marijuana contains hundreds in and maybe more different cannabinoids so here's a breakdown of several different cannabinoids CBD focusing on that in particular has several different properties antibacterial inhibits cancer cell growth nor protective benefits both promotes bone growth reduces sugar levels all these other ones that are listed here that you can see where are the cb1 receptors there are several different parts of the brain so it's a medulla which is involved which has a chemoreceptor trigger zone the cerebellum the basal ganglia cerebral cortex the hypothalamus and the hippocampus as well as a spinal cord now I like this article is published in the green journal it's not that green journal it's a different green journal and I like this because it really talks about pathogenesis and right now we we know a lot about migraine pathogenesis and we know because of the newest you know information on neuro inflammation so it's really interesting is if you look at the research that's already existing out there wood cannabinoids and where it potentially affects the receptors there's a parallel between my grandpa thought physiology as well too for example systemic effects there are variants in the CNR one gene which encodes for a cannabinoid one receptor which results in decreased expression of cb1 associated with migraines and the trigeminal vascular activation we know that the trigeminal vascular system and the trigeminal cervical complex all play a big role in migraine pathogenesis we have peripheral and central activation of those too there's been some research on people who have deficiency endocannabinoids and particularly an and amide and possibly there's a relationship between that and the pathogenesis of migraines - that's still an area that needs further research as well if you take a look at the cortex you have sebum antagonists that suppress glutamate neurotransmission by inhibiting NMDA MDA receptors you also have cb1 receptors that suppress cortical spreading depression which is a precursor for migraines in the vasculature you can see that there's some effect on blood vessels and effect on blood vessel dilation induced by cg RP as well as capsaicin midnight ro coxide in addition you have Ananda mite that is an agonist or activates trip v1 which is involved in also trigeminal vascular activation trip v1 is another area of future study it's actually being currently study in a potential target for future migraine treatments so it's exciting to see that the cannabinoid research actually parallel some of this as well there's some effect on platelets as well and when in relation to platelets there is some research with 5-hydroxytryptamine or v HT receptor ends and migraines in the brain stem so we know that there's a peripheral activation there's also a central activation of migraines which involves a sending pathways that go through the pair Iraq or dr. gray the thalamus to cortex and there's descending pathways that go down as well too and persistent activation of these pathways lead to something called allodynia which was I think mentioned earlier in some of the rat models so what's been shown as a cb1 receptor actually is involved in it with activation of the periaqueductal gray area and also the rostral event remit uh medial medulla as well so here's a quick chart that looks at all this sort of combined together this concept of endocannabinoid deficiency which some people may have a genetic predisposition to or have genetically may have that results in increased glutamate signaling which may lead to cortical spreading depression as a potential oral migraine trigger and basically what I just said is summarized in this diagram here now why is it difficult to do research because it's still listed as a schedule 1 drug including some of those other agents I know dr. goshawk back there is doing some research and he might be able to provide some insight just one on with LSD I believe so he might be able to elaborate how difficult it is to do something like that so it's not an easy process so that's one of the challenges to doing research on cannabis or cannabinoids is because of the the scheduled nature of it other research includes the current research includes in most of the trials in the USSR retrospective studies so these are you know there are no prospective trials where we actually give patients medications and follow them through but there are some European ones which I'm gonna highlight just one quick abstract on the most of the ones that are existing right now are very short not enough patience and a lot of confounding factors in those studies which include tobacco use and comorbid illness as well so I practice in New York State so right now the approved uses for medical cannabis is cancer and all these other ones that are listed the newest one that was just added not too long ago is PTSD so I actually looked up word Island and Rhode Island has a very similar approve approval for these disorders as well recently Rhode Island had a Department of Health Center advisory and this was through other states as well and this had in particular due to the synthetic cannabinoid these are produced these are you can buy these online and what some of these people that manufacture them were changing the chemical structure so they actually added something that was making it cause increase bruising it was affecting vitamin K so just to be aware of issues with synthetic cannabinoids that you can buy online there are also legal issues in these vary by states that would encourage you to look up things in your own state you can't travel out of your state for the most part you can't drive with it there's risk of DUI laws allow federal employees to fire for positive drug tests whereas there may be some protection with state employees as well and it cannot be used in certain institutions such as group homes nursing homes or hospitals so what I mentioned before some of the limitations of retrospective clinical trials is that you know there's limited data from that that we can we can use so I found something you know a recent a meeting that took place in the Amsterdam and it was some German researcher which has a little bit more liberal rules in terms of research I was a prospective study at small study where they took some migraine patients and cluster patients and initially gave them THC one group and another group had cannot CBD only they found that adequate higher doses and result in about 50 55 percent improvement in overall frequency and severity the second phase they gave the migraine patients amitriptyline and also THC CBD combination and they found an improvement as well what's interesting about this is that in the cluster headache patients the only patients that improved were the ones that had some background history of migraines as a child as well so this is a very limited study and I only have this in abstract form it's just to highlight that a prospective trial is more you know it gives us more data than a retrospective trial so just to comment about what's going on at dent the cannabis clinic these are the number of patients that we've seen so far in a in a year or a year and a half period majority the patients are being treated for chronic pain 69% approximately about 30 to 40 percent of those about 30 percent of those are chronic migraine patients this data is from doctormick vague who's one of the leading researchers on concussion and she actually has one of the largest population of concussion patients about 800 in one particular study that she's undergoing right now so in a subset of one of her studies she's actually studying in about 149 individuals with chronic pain who were certified for medical cannabis and they were given concussion related diagnosis of post concussive syndrome she was using five sort of pillar pillars as a treatment modality so these were mood sleep headache dizziness and concentration issues and what she found was that there were three of these had had more significant improvement over a period of time with medical cannabis use versus not and these were there was an 80% improvement in mood and 78% would sleep and 76% with headache so the and that's one of the findings the second important finding in this particular study so this study is published in the abstract form and it's submitted for a publication as in a journal and further analysis of this of the study are being done right now as well - so 80% of the patients experience significant improvement activity limitations symptoms emotions and quality of life this is not showing as clearly but it's showing you that there was an improvement in quality of life pre medical cannabis use was 27% post medical cannabis use it was 43% so there's an improvement it was successfully significant there's further analyses being done with this particular study so stay tuned in fact she's actually presenting this at the American Academy neurology concussion meeting that's taking place later on another finding from this study was the optimal dosing was a byproduct a combination of THC to CBD a one-to-one ratio with a combination of a tincture those three times per day and the inhalation component was a 20 to 1 ratio as a vapor pen and this is more used as an immediate relief which which is not used all the time but just more of a breakthrough pain the cost was 269 per month which is a little bit high but cost of this varies from state to state as well - and hopefully this will decrease over time the the last finding of this particular study was 14% of patients reported side effects all were minimal and all were and 70% were related to administration route whether it was dry mouth or cough so this was fairly tolerated so how do you go about doing this I mean not too many places have a cannabis clinic first you have to contact your physician they have to be certified they have to certify you and then you get registered you apply for a card you get a registration then you go to a dispensary to purchase your product so what are some provider expectations so maintenance of CBD products takes about two weeks to of regular use before patients can start to notice any relief of symptoms the change in cannabis ratios should be done in two to three month and month intervals increments cannabis is dose dependent cost-prohibitive so it does cost more the more you use so you know patients are you know they they want to minimize use and at least and get the most bang for their buck as well too so they might adjust some of their dosing on their own taste of tinctures may restrict use as well to the vaporization is contraindicated for COPD and asthma some drug interactions to be concerned about so opioids you may need to decrease the opioid dose as well - one thing to know is that some of these patients that are coming in with you the you may not feel comfortable giving the medical cabinets if there aren't a high dose of opioids so you have to coordinate with pain management to help them titrate down their dose now if you feel comfortable doing that you can do that but I think most clinicians feel more comfortable with who I was originally prescribing them to lower their dose there's a lot of active research going on now with the use of medical cannabis and getting people off of opioids so that's another area of study and is a big need for that as well - so stay tuned for that research to come out as well you may need to decrease the anxiety dose as well too tricyclic antidepressants they have sedative effects monitor increased side-effects of SSRIs anti retrovirals they may be enzyme inhibition or inducing effects related to that and seizure meds as well may need to be adjusted due to the pharmaco dynamic related changes now establishment expectations so this Dement this depends on the amount of prophylactic products the patients are going to use and their ability to afford their products a lot of the patients that we're seeing are not able to afford some of the products at the dispensaries at the rate right now so that's one of the limitations so what some of them wind up doing is they get approved they wind up using their or smoking marijuana so that's something to be aware of as well - patients may have some reduction in migraine associated symptoms but this may take time CBD maintenance so it does reduce muscle pain anxiety improve sleep the increase in tincture dose must be done slowly to prevent any adverse effects such as dizziness and drowsiness it can take about two weeks to develop any kind of consistent use of CBD to notice any positive effects once again THC provides more immediate pain relief in this is more done in the form of a vape form as well too so this is going to be important they can't take this to work they can't drive within six hours after use it will create a high and it may worsen anxiety or paranoia just a few more slides I don't know how we are on time wait okay so alright so there there's improvement that takes over time you need to set these realistic expectations for these patients this I got from the the Rhode Island Department of Health just to show you what people are doing in Rhode Island so this is the data from two thousand sixteen to seventeen there's about 4500 patients that have been being treated for chronic pain and those are some of the other indications and who's writing this in Rhode Island majority are internal medicine family medicine and not so much neurology further research needs to be done i want to thank dr. laszlo Metzler who is leading the campaign at dent doctormick Vig who provided some of the research data

understatement i had two very young children my daughters were four and two years old and um just i was flawed i didn't think that that i would be a breast cancer patient during treatment bernice o'donnell experienced many common side effects of chemotherapy at the time medical cannabis wasn't legally available with chemo i ended up being nauseous like so many other chemo patients and um to combat that the doctors prescribed anti-nausea medication which was helpful however with chemo you end up having difficulty for me at least um difficulty passing food and then the anti-nut anti-nausea medication made it even more challenging to pass food current day if i had gone through it i would have i would have tried the medical cannabis as of july 1st patients in virginia now have the option of using medical cannabis through virginia's regulated medical cannabis program patients have been able to find relief from the side effects of chemotherapy by using medical cannabis relief for issues like pain nausea loss of appetite and sleep disruption as well as anxiety not to mention pain that may be associated with the cancer itself jen michelle padini of virginia normal says medical cannabis can be an alternative to opiate prescriptions she says data from other states struck a core with legislators in virginia looking for a solution to the opiate crisis it will have the same results here in virginia that we've seen across the country where we're we're seeing a very quickly about a 25 percent reduction in opioid overdose fatalities and increasing up to about 35 percent after just a few

anxiety or paranoia i know just the cannabinoid for you for marijuana morning news i'm brooke burgstahler cannabinoids are chemical compounds found in cannabis by far the most well-known cannabinoid is thc or delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol but lately there's been a lot of hype around delta 8 thc a cannabinoid cousin of delta 9. delta 8 thc is chemically different from delta 9 thc by only a few atomic bonds while delta 9 can exist in cannabis strains in amounts up to 30 to 40 percent delta 8 only exists naturally in fractions of a percent nevertheless companies are stoked on the idea of extracting and concentrating delta 8 for its unique effects word on the street is that delta 8 thc gets you high but to a lesser extent and without the anxiety it's also known for its appetite stimulating analgesic and neuroprotective properties and anti-nausea effects in a 1995 study conducted by dr rafael meshalim eight children with cancer who were being treated with different drugs along with chemotherapy were given delta 8 thc in conjunction with chemo and as a result vomiting was completely prevented with side effects reported as being negligible so obviously delta 8 thc deserves our attention there seem to be both medical and recreational benefits to the cannabinoid are you into delta eight throw those thoughts in the comments and thanks for watching today's

what i do with them um i make sobs and i uh actually eat them i use it in uh with coconut oil and i put in my coffee every single day except saturday and sunday which uh i give my body a break but it does amazing things and i will share that with you so don't throw away your roots keep them bad boys they got to be uh dried hung up and dried and then i'll cut it off bro that good stuff is all right happy growing everybody since uh you have now washed and dried your roots they need to be really washed and dried and if you have grown organically if you've been using salt-based um nutrients i probably wouldn't do this if you're going to put this on your body or in your body you you want organic roots are filters for your plant and basically it's in your soil it's bringing up in into your roots so make sure that uh you are organically based what i do is i break my roots down i've got me uh these fisca big o clipper dills but basically you just cut your your roots down into the smallest pieces you can get and then what i'll do is i'll put mine in this uh mortar and pulse stone granite whatever it is and try to get this as powdery as possible so you're going to have all sizes um whatever you have if you have a little um ninja food processor thing that'll work too but you want to get it as fine and as powdery as you could possibly do i don't know these words um the words uh the scientific chemicals that i'm going to put up on the screen so you can see it but one is for protecting your liver and the other is um a cancer killer and what this cancer killer does it sends a signal to the to the cancer cell tells it to commit suicide it um hypothesis i think is what um what it causes and that's like say if you have a a tadpole when a tadpole turns into a frog it sends a positive this chemical to the tail to tell it to die and then that's how the frog will lose its tail basically does the same thing to a cancer cell cancer cells don't have the trigger that tells it when it's damaged to kill itself it just doesn't do that so what this does will do that i am not a doctor i i can't tell you um i don't want to tell you you know eat this stuff um how i do it is uh you need get a get from you know talk to your doctor if you're if you're in a situation where you got cancer or something i don't want it to ruin anything like say i i can only tell you what i've been doing um i put it in in coconut oil and then uh once it's extracted out i pour that coconut oil into a little jar i take take a teaspoon every day in my coffee except for saturday and sunday which i give my body a rest so i work i have it in my coffee i just put a scoop in there and then you need a creamer of some type like a powder creamer that it'll attach to easier for your body absorb if you're going to use in sauce i take that same um coconut oil and i will put it into my assab bomb making process um like i said i'll put the chemicals up what we're looking trying to extract out of there um i they're crazy words so um two ounces or two ounces of this you want to cut this up in two cups worth into your i put it in a crock pot your own crock pot here along with about four or five cups of water two cups of organic coconut oil um i like the organic um i don't think it makes too much of a difference it's just the carrier but i like coconut oil it uh it hardens up um if you put it once this is done you're going to cook this thing for 12 to 18 hours i go 24 you make sure you replace the water as it you know evaporates out simmers out but you want to um the oil will stay and that's what's going to collect all your uh your chemicals that we're looking for um like say i'm really after two um but you know we don't know what the uh what the other ones do um but for solves and stuff it's absolutely wonderful it's great stuff don't throw them out keep your roots so you're chopping them up roots coming off they're going to be all sizes i break them down and i got some big ones small ones i'm going to use this to grind it up and then put it in my coconut oil and i say i'm gonna do it for 24 hours i will put those chemicals up so you know what they are if you have any questions you're welcome to come to our uh facebook group it's called growers helping growers it's just a bunch of people that uh every we have every type of grower indoor outdoor hydroponic you name it we got it from professionals to people that just started yesterday we can answer your question growers helping growers just come and visit us and are you gonna ask the question in the in the comments i only do it this style i don't know of any other way this is the way i do it like i said and i've been taking this for over a year now um five days a week and uh i'm feeling great but i don't know about you but this i like to say i'm not a doctor um i'm gonna make that disclaimer now don't be taking this stuff it could do damage to your liver i don't know talk to your doctor but if you put into sobs you're pretty safe but if you're going to consume it you might want to check with your doctor if you have any questions like say come visit us at growers helping growers on facebook

LAST WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THE SHORTAGE WILL LAST UNTIL NEXT YEAR. MARIJUANA MEDICATION MEDICAL REPORTER DINA BAIR HAS A WARNING. A NEW STUDY RAISES THE RED FLAG ABOUT CANNABINOID INTERACTING WITH PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS WITH THE RENEWED LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL POT AND THE GROWING POPULARITY OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA. PENN STATE RESEARCHERS SET OUT TO SEE HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT DRUGS AMERICANS WERE ALREADY TAKING. THEY FOUND 57 PROBLEMS. THE REMARKABLE FINDING WAS THAT WE IDENTIFIED 57. DRUGS THAT HAVE A NARROW THERAPEUTIC INDEX AND THAT MEANS THE RANGE OF AFRICA SEE TO TOXICITY IS VERY NARROW AND THE PRESENCE OF CANNABINOIDS CHEMICALS FOUND IN CANNABIS COULD TIP THE SCALE TO THE DARK SIDE WHICH ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS PATIENTS TAKING BLOOD THINNERS LIKE COMMIT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF SOMEONE WERE ON THAT MEDICATION WERE SUDDENLY THE AD THE HIGH DOSE OF CAN AVENUE AID NO MATTER WHAT THE SOURCE THEY'RE AT RISK FOR INTERFERING WITH THE METABOLISM OF THAT. COUMADIN AND HAVE AN ADVERSE REACTION MORE THAN 8 MILLION AMERICANS ARE CURRENTLY TAKING BLOOD THINNERS. AND MANY ARE OLDER SEEKING MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR PAIN RELIEF OR CBD OIL WITHOUT KNOWING THE COMBINATION COULD BE DISASTROUS WOMEN STATES LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL WHEN THEY RECORD OR THEY LEGALIZE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. WHAT'S NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS THE FACT THAT IT MAY INTERFERE WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DRUGS OR CARDIAC SOME AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AN ANESTHETIC CALLED PROPOFOL ANESTHESIOLOGISTS NOTICE THE INTERACTION IN SURGICAL PATIENTS FOLKS THAT ARE HEAVY USERS OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA FORCES TAKE MORE PRO FOOTBALL TO SEDATE HER SURGERY, THE LIST IS LENGTHY INCLUDING BLOOD PRESSURE DEPRESSION, BIRTH CONTROL FIRE OI AND CANCER MEDICATIONS OFFERING GUIDANCE. PENN STATE RESEARCHERS SAY PATIENTS TAKING DOZENS OF DRUG SHOULD BE CLOSELY MONITORED IF THEY USE CANNABINOIDS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. DOCTORS DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY MAKE MEDICATION DECISIONS PEOPLE DON'T DISCLOSE. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE USING ILLICIT RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA OR AS YOU SAY CBD OIL THAT THEY CAN GET OVER THE COUNTER OR MEDICAL MARIJUANA THEY DON'T THINK OF THAT AS A MEDICATION NECESSARILY AND I DON'T WANT TO PAINT IT THAT IT'S NECESSARILY A BAD THING IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MONITOR AND BE CAREFUL THOUGH THEY ARE VERY BIOACTIVE THE VERY BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES THAT GIVE MEDICAL MARIJUANA POWER. ALSO DIMINISH OR ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF OTHER DRUGS MUCH LIKE A DRUG TO DRUG INTERACTION. BUT EVEN CBD CAN CAUSE AN ISSUE WE'VE SHOWN THAT ALL CBD OILS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL. AND SO THE FDA FOR INSTANCE JUST HAD TO RECALL A CBD OIL PREPARATION THAT HAD TOO MUCH LEAD IN. SO I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE AGAINST USING OVER THE COUNTER CBD OIL FOR INSTANCE AND IF THEY ARE USING WHETHER CBD OIL OR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA JUST DISCLOSED THAT TO YOUR DOCTOR. SO THAT THEY CAN PLAN HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT YOU WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS. THE RESEARCHERS SAY THEY PLAN TO ROUTINELY UPDATE AND ADD TO THE DRUG INTERACTION", "i8ITLj9AHdQ": "hello again everybody and welcome back to your career economists in today's episode we will be making CBD coconut oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button for those of you that are new to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much so I'm gonna leave a link to my CBD MCT oil and that's gonna kind of go over the entire deke art process so I'm just gonna run through a really quick today I've already packaged up my biotics flower and I have that right beside me here this is 24 grams of Vioxx flour which came in at 21.1% CBD and this is our bag of flour so I'm just gonna put this in the oven for 30 minutes D carb at 250 degrees okay so while we're waiting for the flour to D carp I'm gonna go over some of the materials you'll need to make the CBD coconut oil first you're going to need coconut oil now I have organic coconut oil just run to the middle nothing crazy I got this larger container at BJ's you can pick it up yourself you always get it on Amazon I like to use organic stuff same thing with my MCT oil it's just if you're going to be putting this kind of stuff into your body you're gonna want it to be organic and we've put all that effort into making our head flour organics so why not just buy some more more organic products the other thing you'll need is you'll need to measure out 2 cups of coconut oil and I'll get into that too but you definitely don't want a measuring cup and of course in today's video we'll we will be featuring the magic butter machine now this recipe can be used without a magic butter machine but for today's purposes we are going to be using a magic butter machine some people use crock pots some people use a bunch of other stuff I just like the magic butter machine because it's just a no mess situation its cleanup is super easy but you can't use another household kitchen gadgets so now we'll wait for the flour and we'll start making the oil okay so our canvas has just D carved in the oven so before we take it out we are going to add the coconut oil to the magic butter machine again if you're using a crock-pot or whatever the recipe is still the same but your device is going to be different so here I've measured out two cups of coconut oil and you're just gonna put it right in try to get as much of it as possible I know coconut oil can be a pain because of its solid texture and you know it melts at like I don't know 75 degrees or something like that so what I like to do too is take the glove and I'll just kind of use that to get the coconut oil off I can always wash the glove all right so that's all the coconut oil now we're going to grab our D carb M flower smells awesome and gonna add it right in make sure you get everything get this out of the way make sure everything's out I'm gonna put this right on lockdown I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in all right and so the magic butter machine recipe typically calls for two hours at 160 degrees but I like to do 160 degrees for four hours I like the longer cook so that's it now we just wait for the machine all right so the magic butter machine is now done it's been four hours and we're going to take the top off here now looks to be pretty nice not a whole lot of mess this time around which is great shake it off a little bit and now we're gonna slide this scoop off the edge let me show you inside here very typical for this machine you just want to scoop off the edge get as much as you can that plant material holds all that CBD all the good stuff that down I put the glove on my right hand and I am going to pour [Applause] he's gonna get all that juice out of there looks really good so now we'll put this off to the side just back up now there's some plant material down there in the bottom so I'm just gonna scoop the rest of this out all right give this one more good squeeze you can see right there just squeezing it get the most you can out of it that looks to be it so we'll put this in our sink and that is it so what I'll do is I'll take the coconut oil I'll put it in these mason jars and I will let it rest it will risa Lydda fie and you can do what you want with it now the great thing about coconut oil is you can add it to your lotion you can cook with it you can use it as a lotion you can pretty much do anything you really want with coconut oil it's kind of a really good way to use CBD but that's today's recipe that's all I have for if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now those links will be in the description below I'll also put the recipe for this in the description below and until next time thanks for watching", "d_CPWJw9Los": "On Nature League, we spend the third week\nof each month exploring a current trending article from the peer-reviewed literature. Scientific information isn\u2019t just for scientists-\nit\u2019s for everyone! It just requires a bit of a break down. [CHEERY INTRO MUSIC] For this month\u2019s De-Natured segment, we\u2019re\ngoing to look at an article released in August 2018 in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation Psychiatry. This month is all about plants, and in this\nmonth\u2019s Lesson Plan we began by mentioning that most organisms on Earth depend on plants\nto live. Not only do plants provide oxygen to the atmosphere,\nbut they serve as the energy starting point for many living food webs. But in the realm of human medicine, plants\nand their isolated compounds can yield much more than oxygen and food- especially in the\ncase of cannabis. In this paper entitled, \u201cEffect of Cannabidiol\non Medial Temporal, Midbrain, and Striatal Dysfunction in People at Clinical High Risk\nof Psychosis\u201d, the researchers report the results of a new clinical trial that investigated\nhow cannabidiol, or CBD, can affect individuals at high risk of psychosis. So here\u2019s what\u2019s already known. Cannabis is a genus of flowering plants- plants\nthat have been used by humans for thousands of years for a multitude of purposes. Two well-known varieties of plants in this\ngenus are commonly known as hemp and marijuana. Two chemical compounds have contributed to\nthe well-known nature of Cannabis plants. The first is cannabidiol, or CBD, and it\u2019s\nprimarily found in hemp. The second compound is tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and it\u2019s primarily found in marijuana. While both compounds have the exact same molecular\nformula, THC is psychoactive, meaning it can create a high, or euphoria. But what do cannabis plants have to do with\npsychiatry? That\u2019s where brain chemistry comes in. The reason our bodies react to CBD and THC\nat all has to do with the fact that human brains have an endocannabinoid system. Alterations in this system are associated\nwith the symptom of psychosis, which can be generally defined as a loss of contact with\nreality. While some research has shown that regular\ncannabis use can be a risk factor for developing psychosis, especially in teenagers, these\nfindings specifically refer to THC. The other compound, CBD, can actually have\nthe opposite effect. In fact, some clinical studies have shown\nthat CBD has antipsychotic properties for people with certain mental disorders. Despite a growing body of evidence that CBD\ncan be beneficial to those suffering psychotic symptoms, scientists have yet to figure out\nhow. To address this, the research team observed\nthe effects of CBD on three specific regions of the brain in people at clinical high risk\nof psychosis. The first of these regions is the medial temporal\nlobe, or MTL, and its primary function has to do with new learning. The other regions are the midbrain and striatum,\nwhich also contribute to learning in the form of helping to encode and update information\nin our memory. To observe the effect of CBD on the brain,\nthe team had participants perform something called the verbal paired associate learning\ntask, or VPA. Participants at clinical high risk of psychosis,\nreferred to as CHR, were recruited as well as healthy control participants who were not\nat CHR. For the purposes of this video, we\u2019ll refer\nto CHR participants as high risk participants to get away from being too bogged down in\ninitializations. In the study, high risk participants were randomly\nassigned to a CBD treatment or placebo treatment. After taking the assigned drug, participants\nperformed a VPA task while having their brain scanned using functional MRI. The healthy control group didn\u2019t receive\nany drug treatment, but they still did the tests and imaging. But what exactly did the VPA task entail? It actually has three separate testing conditions:\nencoding, recall, and baseline. During encoding, participants answered yes or no\nto whether a pair of words went well together. So for example, \u201csharks\u201d and \u201cawesome\u201d\n- definite yes! In the recall condition, participants were\nshown one of the words they saw during encoding and asked to say which word it had been paired\nwith. The baseline bit was a control of sorts where\nthe participant looked at a blank version of the setup they\u2019d seen during encoding\nand recall. The response of the brain during the VPA task\nwas measured using fMRI. Specifically, the scan measured the blood\noxygen level-dependent, or BOLD, response of the brain. Basically, this allowed the researchers to\nmeasure the flow and composition of blood in the brain during the encoding and recall\nparts of the VPA task. Then, they could compare these responses to\nthe baseline results. So what did they find? Overall, high risk participants who were assigned\na placebo had several regions of the brain activate differently than people in the control\ngroup. Similar to previous studies, these regions\nincluded the three thought to be associated with psychosis. The specific hypothesis the team was testing\nwas whether participants at high risk who were given CBD would have a level of brain\nactivation in between the activation levels of the control group, and the high risk group\nwho were given placebo. The team did find this middle ground activation\nin the striatum during encoding, and in the parahippocampal cortex and midbrain during\nrecall. These results suggest that for these specific\nbrain regions, CBD may help normalize brain responses in individuals at clinical high\nrisk of psychosis. This article was published in the one of the\nmost prestigious families of medical journals. In addition to academic circles, the results\nhave made headlines in the news as well. Here are some reasons why I think this study\nis capturing both scientists and citizens. First of all, the results are directly relevant\nto helping humans. Unlike some other articles that we\u2019ve discussed\non De-Natured, this study has a direct human end use, and an important one. Mental health disorders affect people in every\nwalk of life, and in the case of psychosis, as many as 3 in 100 people in the U.S. will\nexperience the symptom of psychosis at some point in their lives. Another reason I think this study made the\ncut is because the research team was the first to do something. In this case, they are the first to give evidence\nof how CBD acts in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms. This is a major level up from just knowing\nthat CBD can reduce these symptoms. And of course, whenever there\u2019s a promising\ndiscovery in the medical field, there\u2019s the potential for profit. There is a growing body of literature supporting\nthe use of CBD for medicinal purposes. And that means major money for those involved\nin supplying the product. In the United States alone, hemp-derived CBD\nis predicted to soon become a billion dollar market, and that\u2019s without federal legalization. There is undoubtedly a lot to gain from using\nthis particular plant product for medical treatments, and money is certainly part of\nthat gain. The devil is in the methods section when it\ncomes to issues in experimental design. However, this research team did a great job\nof removing potentially confounding variables and removing bias where possible. For example, the study design was parallel-group,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized. Randomization allows the researchers to remove\nthe bias that comes from assigning specific people to specific treatments. It\u2019s picking names out of a hat instead of, say,\nbecause you like their asymmetrical haircut. Double blind trials are ones where the participant\nand the researcher aren\u2019t in on who was assigned which treatment. That way, the researchers are less likely\nto be looking for certain associations. If a researcher knew a participant had been\ngiven the CBD, they might start looking for some kind of result, or jump to conclusions\nunintentionally. We just can\u2019t help ourselves when it comes\nto investigating things- it\u2019s impossible to not start explaining what we see, and double-blinding\na trial is a great way to avoid that. What about the \u201cparallel groups\u201d bit of\nthe research design? This piece is actually more of a limitation\nof the study. In parallel group studies, each participant\nonly receives one of the treatments, and then those people are compared to separate individuals\nwho received the other treatment. In this study, this meant that the high risk\nparticipants either received the CBD or the placebo, but none of them were actually observed\nunder the effects of both. With a non-crossover design, the baseline\nis a bit iffy. I mean, just think about how different we\nall are when it comes to chemical reactions! Take alcohol, for example. Comparing you sober to a friend who\u2019s had\na bit to drink might be a completely different story than if you reversed the roles. Luckily, the researchers do an awesome job\nof pointing out limitations like this in the discussion section of the paper. They mention the issue of the parallel design\nstructure, and suggest that a study be done where each high risk participant be tested\nwith both the placebo and CBD treatment. That said, they mention that the two high\nrisk groups were reasonably similar in terms of demographics and baseline health measures. This does, however, lead me to another critique\nof the study, and that is the sample pool of participants. One potential problem area has to do with\nsample size. There were 15 high risk participants assigned\nCBD, 16 high risk participants assigned the placebo, and 19 age matched healthy controls. While these numbers do allow for testing statistical\nsignificance at the cutoff levels the team was interested in, more is almost always better\nwhen it comes to determining the strength of an effect. There\u2019s also the issue of diversity. In the table showing sociodemographic measures,\nthe paper only reports age, sex, and education level. However, there\u2019s no mention of variables\nlike race and ethnicity, meaning that this could be yet another psychiatry study done\non a Caucasian sample. Conducting research on participants of varied\nbackgrounds is essential to understanding the full picture of drug-brain interactions. Here\u2019s the thing. Humans and non-human animals have been using\nplants for medicinal purposes throughout the history of their time on Earth. Understanding how the chemicals in certain\nplants can affect our brains is a really complicated area of research, and a study like this one\nis just a single piece of that journey. As the research team put it themselves, this\nwasn\u2019t so much of a clinical study as it was a proof of concept, pilot study. It\u2019s exciting to imagine what we might find\nnext when it comes to this amazing kingdom of life on Earth. Thanks for watching this episode of De-Natured\nhere on Nature League.

"i'd like to welcome you here to the seminar thank you so much for joining us whether you're joining us live or you're viewing this later as a recording we are so happy to have you with us my name is naomi hoffer i'm the program manager for the sherry servado berson brain cancer survivorship program and with us also in the background here as part of our program is alexa greenstein who is our survivorship nurse practitioner and mary des tree who is our marin expansion program liaison who's expanding our supportive care services for survivors and caregivers to our marin patient and caregiver community this webinar is part of our regular living well after brain cancer treatment webinar series which is part of our growing survivorship program thanks to a generous donation from cherie cebrato brisson i know many of you many survivors are interested in medicinal cannabis and have heard a lot about it but there's a lot of questions so what do we know and what don't we know we're going to talk about that today with our experts so first of all we're going to be talking a little bit about the history and overview what is cannabis and what are the components what are the therapeutic uses what do we know that it's used for and what it might be beneficial for we're also going to hear about the research and current findings that we know exist right now what do we know about this and um then turn around what this means for you as you're considering using this for your own therapeutic uses so after we hear uh from our panelists we're gonna have some time at the end for q a and we invite you to submit your questions using the q a box and then we're going to have an after the show segments where we will hear from survivors and hear how those who are using it for brain tumor recovery and management of side effects how it's going for them and we'll have a chance to hear from you as well and hear your questions so i feel very privileged and honored to introduce two speakers with us today who are very well versed in this subject matter dr donald abrams is the immediate past chief of the hematology oncology division at san francisco general hospital and professor of clinical medicine at ucsf he has an integrative oncology consultation practice at the ucsf center for integrative medicine the osher center for integrative medicine and we are pleased to have him also as part of our regular survivorship programming at the ucsf brain tumor center alongside his expertise in cancer nutrition and botanicals dr abrams has a long history of interest and involvement in clinical research that evaluates medicinal marijuana on various patient populations he co-authored the chapter on cannabinoids in cancer in the oxford university press integrative oncology text that he co-edited with dr andrew weil he co-edits the national cancer institute's cannabinoids and cancer website and he was also a member of the national academies of sciences committee that published the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids current state of evidence and recommendations for research published in january 2017. we're really honored to have him with us today and we also have dr eduardo rodriguez dr rodriguez is a glioblastoma or gbm clinical trial data scientist in the brain tumor center at ucsf he is a trained physician who graduated from national polytechnic institute in mexico city and also holds a master's degree in clinical research from ucsf dr rodriguez currently serves as co-principal investigator in the study on the impact of cannabis on the quality of life in patients with central nervous system tumors we are truly grateful to have him here as well to share his latest research with us we'll first hear from dr abrams and then from dr rodriguez and then back again to dr abrams but dr abrams thank you so much for being here and i will now turn it over to you thank you naomi it's a pleasure to be here so as mentioned i am going to start out by giving you a little bit of background on what cannabis is what cannabis isn't what we know about it and how long we've known what we've known so yes so this is my topic uh what do we really know i want to start out by reviewing a little bit the history of cannabis and what it may be useful for so this is the so-called siberian ice princess it's a mummy that was very well preserved in the ice in siberia she was so well preserved that her tattoos are actually being copied i understand by some millennials but in any event she turns out to be under an mri scan a woman in her mid-20s who appears to have breast cancer that spread to her bones and around her waist was a belt that had a pouch at the end of it and in the pouch were the flowers of the female plant of cannabis sativa suggesting that this woman dated about 2700 years ago knew about the potential medicinal benefits of cannabis it's postulated by the anthropologists or archaeologists or whoever makes these hypotheses that perhaps she was using cannabis to treat the symptoms of her cancer if not perhaps even the cancer itself and again i think that's a bit of a leap because we don't know that everybody in this tribe wasn't buried with cannabis around their ways so cannabis has been a medicine probably for the last 3000 years it's one of the oldest known psychoactive plants cannabis sativa or cannabis indica its reported first use again was 3 000 years ago in china south of mongolia made its way along the silk route to the indian subcontinent and then further west into the arab world where it was widely used as medicine cannabis was brought to the west by w.b o'shaughnessy who was a british east indie surgeon who was working in india and saw all the potential benefits of cannabis and brought it to the united kingdom at that time it had many uses supposedly as a pain reliever a relaxing agent anti-inflammatory against muscle spasms and also for seizures at the beginning of the last century in the united states most of the forerunners of what we recognize today as big pharma had cannabis products available for physicians to prescribe to their patients cannabis actually fell out of favor uh in 1937 with the introduction of the marijuana tax act where the mexican word for the drug was used to sort of fool physicians the act was introduced by a prohibitionist who felt that widespread use of cannabis by african-american jazz musicians and mexican migrant workers was going to lead to increased crime and mental illness in the united states so ultimately cannabis was removed from the united states formulary we know that cannabis is potent because of chemicals called cannabinoids which are present in the plant we believe that there are at least 400 different chemical compounds and of those about 140 are these structures that resemble delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol which is actually the main psychoactive agent in the plant delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has been studied in israeli children with cancer and felt to be an effective anti-nausea medicine for children getting chemotherapy and then all of us are quite familiar now with cannabidiol or cbd which again is a related compound to the delta nine thc again in addition to those three cannabinoids there are at least 100 others and there are other compounds in the plant itself that have medicinal benefit so again some of the non-tetrahydrocannabinol cannabinoids are cbd which i'm going to talk more about cbn which is a breakdown product actually of delta 9 thc and many people who use old cannabis which is rich in cbn says say it's very useful for sleep cannabinogirol or cbg is another non-psychoactive cannabinoid similar to cbd which they say is going to be the next cbd as yet it has not been studied in clinical trials but people are trying to grow plants that have more cbg than current uh strains do i think a very interesting cannabinoid is tetrahydrocannabiurine or thcv which apparently decreases appetite decreases appetite for food for alcohol uh tobacco and also for opiates so this is uh if we're going to go about developing individual cannabinoids as medical treatments this one is one that we might hear more about in the future and in addition to the uh cannabinoids there are also flavonoids and terpenes which give the different strains their characteristic smells and it's felt that all of these work together in the plant to sort of balance the effects of the delta 9 thc which again is the main psychoactive component so it's sort of like the other compounds provide the yin and the yang or the yin to the thc's young if you will so they help increase and augment the beneficial effects of thc and perhaps decrease some of the adverse effects so since cannabis was removed from our formulary we haven't learned a lot about what it does therapeutically because it's very difficult to study since it's a schedule one compound which means that it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use according to our federal government but over the past 70 years since cannabis has been prohibited we've learned a lot about how it works basically all of us have two different types of receptors for those cannabinoids the cb1 receptor is one of the most densely populated receptors in the human brain unfortunately we don't learn about that in medical school that shows you the extent of reefer madness the cdb1 receptor is distributed widely throughout the whole body and this receptor is found in all animal species down through sea squirts the cb2 receptor is was originally not felt to be in the brain but subsequently has been identified but not at the great density of the cb1 receptor the cb2 receptor was initially found in cells of the immune system in the spleen and in the peripheral blood in the natural killer cells and the b lymphocytes suggesting that this receptor has something to do with immunity so why do we in all animal species down through sea squirts have cannabinoid receptors you've never seen a monkey smoking a joint well similar to our own endorphins our own endogenous opiates that we make we also make endocannabinoids we make our own cannabinoids chemicals similar to thc and the other cannabinoid compounds the first was identified by my friend and colleague rafael machulim at hebrew university in jerusalem felt to be the father of cannabinoid chemistry and he named it anandamide after the sanskrit word for bliss subsequently another endocannabinoid to arachnodonyl glycerol has also been identified so why do we and all animal species have this system of cannabinoid receptors and our own endogenous cannabinoids the endogenous cannabinoids are synthesized on demand and when they complex with the cb1 receptor they cause changes in the cells particularly the cb1 in the brain cell which lead to changes in our appetite in control of immune function muscles and pain in our thinking in our nausea etc and when these endocannabinoids complex with the so-called cb2 receptor they're also involved in alterations in our immune function in cell proliferation cells dividing inflammation and also pain i think michael pollan says it best michael is a berkeley journalist who wrote the book the botany of desire and he has a whole chapter on cannabis and he says the reason that we in all animal species have these receptors and endocannabinoids is to help us to forget and in his next book the omnivore's dilemma michael is trying to gather his own food and in each chapter it's about gathering food and in one chapter he's sitting in the woods holding a rifle on his shoulder holding very still actually crouched in the woods and he said this is painful and out of the blue he postulates that the reason that we in all animal species dependent on praying pr e for our food have this system is to help us to forget pain so with that in mind the activities of both thc and cbd for example do both share analgesic or pain relief as their main probably activity thc unlike cbd is psychoactive the cbd is felt not to be psychoactive but it is anti-psychotic for people who have those sorts of illnesses and it also decreases anxiety so i think it really depends on what we mean by psychoactive it's obviously acting in the brain it just doesn't get you high and we live in a society a puritan derived judeo-christian base that thinks that being high is something that's not something we should strive for and that's something that's a whole other discussion so you know cbd has sort of catapulted to the top of the most favored cannabinoid list because it doesn't get you high but it i think it is psychoactive and we know that again as michael pollan predicted that in states where cannabis is licensed and available for patients there has been a marked decrease in prescription of pain medications anxiety is also anxiety medications have also been released it was mentioned that i was on the committee at the national academies of science engineering and medicine that reviewed 10 000 articles on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids and these are some of the conclusions that we came up with as far as what it's most beneficial for the largest body of evidence is really in patients receiving chemotherapy that connect cannabis and cannabinoids particularly are licensed and approved to decrease nausea and vomiting we all appreciate that cannabis can increase appetite and again it seems to be very useful in patients who have chronic pain particularly most of the clinical trials have looked at patients who have neuropathy or pain generated from damaged nerves and cannabis in this situation seems to be much more effective than placebo and probably as effective as the currently prescribed gabapentin or neurontin i see many patients in my practice who really enjoy cannabis sometimes just cbd sometimes thcs sometimes both as a treatment for their insomnia saying that it definitely helps them to sleep and then the question of whether depression and anxiety are relieved i guess can be uh answered a little bit by the graph on the right showing that prescriptions for anxiety medications are markedly decreased in states where cannabis is available depression less so but definitely decrease so cbd again has gone from being an unknown cannabinoid to being uh the most favored and i attribute that to my friend and colleague sanjay gupta who did his first special uh weed in uh 2013. and in that show he showed charlotte figgy a young girl recently deceased who had refractory childhood seizure disorder go from a child that couldn't do anything because she was constantly seizing to the happy smiling girl on the right just after taking a drop of a cbd oil under her tongue and this ultimately led to gw pharmaceuticals developing the drug epidiolex which is now licensed and approved as a cbd treatment for children with this disorder prior to the large studies of epidialex there were really very few clinical trials on the use of cbd in humans most of the information that we had to rely on came from test tube and animal studies very few clinical trials of cbd existed but the in vitro and animal studies do suggest potential therapeutic applications we actually did a clinical a survey of patients at three integrative medicine centers in san francisco chicago and san diego as well as clients in 10 dispensaries in those cities asking people using cbd dominant products what they are using it for and as you can see here 50 reported pain is their main symptom that they used it for but fully 63 or two-thirds were using cbd for pain relief again 44 for anxiety a third for insomnia and 20 for depression and that's cbd dominant we also asked how effective this was and people rated it in all of these situations eight out of ten as far as being quite effective again this is not a placebo control trial but this is the sort of information that we need to provide us with sort of avenues to determine what we should study next personally however i think cbd is a bit over the top it's now a 23 billion dollar industry and at the farmers market at the ferry building we were surprised to see a cbd sunday for sale that was sold out and now there's cbd infused clothing that claims to prevent soreness before it starts and then last week or a few weeks ago stress zoo elephants are being given cbd oil to help them chill out and stop fighting i'd love to know if that worked or not so i am going to turn the session over now to my colleague who is going to talk about what we know about research in cannabis in brain tumor patients particularly thank you so much dr abrams we will hear again from dr abrams and invite him back and now i'm going to invite dr rodriguez to come up and as dr abram said to talk more about the the research being done currently with brain tumor patients at ucsf dr rodriguez are you here yes hello naomi hi i cannot turn and turn on my video it's been disabled right now um well thank you very much for an invitation and i would like to thank to all the participants for their interest in this this talk um and i think thank you to dr abrams for that good introduction on what's the overview of cannabis so now what i would like to address is what is uh naomi can you tell me if you're seeing my slides please yes we see it yes perfect um i would like to address what is being done in the realm of uh specifically neuron ecology with cannabis as dr abrams mentioned the research really in humans is being poor to say the least because of many hurdles and i think it's mainly because of all the legal aspects of it so i'm going to reiterate a little bit of what dr abrams already said so the potential uses for cannabis to treat nausea and vomiting induced by chemo radiation uh to help increase the appetite and therefore the weight in our patients when they are undergoing chemo radiation and cannabis moderately improved chronic pain and the only kind of not likely to have a role in depression is cbd uh although this is debatable because this all has been done only in um animal experiments and as we probably know too uh measured depression is a little bit tricky as well and uh like dr abrams mentioned most of the patients that report using cannabis say that it improves their sleep quality so medical cannabis as an anti-cancer the first article that was released let's say was in 1974 which actually was on a press release by the washington post where they claimed that marijuana psychoactive component thc slowed the growth of lung cancer breast cancer and virus-induced leukemia in laboratory mice and prolong their lives by as much as 36 percent i think this is um unique in the sense that it was uh first published on a paper rather than in a scientific journal and then afterwards the the scientific paper came out in 1975 and this is uh kind of like a screenshot of an enhanced image of course it's not the original uh image of both of those articles however it got the attention of the federal government and it was when when it got investigated and then it was put under schedule one by the dea which again it poses many legal hurdles uh since then uh there are there have been many efforts to try to prove that it's actually an anti-cancer agent but again most of the efforts have been done in animals and cells and much of the research has been done in thc because of the mechanism of thc is well known and cbd as well and information on the beneficial effects of non-psychotropic cannabinoids is right for in vitro and animal studies like i already explained and specifically to address the brain tumor realm is tricky because um most of the studies or most of the drugs are being developed to try to use as therapies to be effective in vitro or in animal models in rats or mice or monkeys but then when that is translated to humans it doesn't always work so that's definitely a place where we need to improve the the research that we are doing um on this realm in the brain tumor space cbd has shown remarkable results in vitro uh like dr abrams mentioned uh this this was first shown by uh the israeli group um but the mechanism unfortunately for which it prevents tumor growth is not fully understood there are many theories on why they do it uh some of them are they say because it depletes uh oxygen to the to the tumor cells and that that's a feasible uh mechanism but it's not proven um yet and there are very few clinical studies on cannabis and cannabidiol like i we already explained uh however uh all the in vitro and in vivo and animal studies suggests a potential therapeutic applications so what's the evidence in humans that we have so far where i have a few examples here and this is this was actually recently published on a systematic review that we that we did so we did an exhaustive review of the literature and we pulled some of the uh articles that we thought they were the most not only the most interesting but the the ones that add to the literature and in this topic so in 2006 in spain uh this is also a friend of dr abrams manuel guzman um conducted a pilot clinical trial study of thc in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and what he did was inject thc at different concentrations and different schedules in nine patients um unfortunately what this showed was um that it didn't even help so can you see my pointer uh naomi yes we can perfect so so these arrows this is just what i i just want to go over this really quick uh these are the mris of the patients and this curve what it shows is the growth of the tumor in in centimeters and cubic centimeters and the arrows is when uh thc was administered so as we can see actually didn't stop it uh same for here and this is this was uh patients who needed a resection so this drop that we see in in the tumor is uh the resection and then this is after resection so it actually didn't help however it was a small sample and of nine patients only and um and some of the measurements and some of the uh how it was applied it can be debatable but it was it's a step in the right direction uh in 2017 in england uh dr susan short conducted a two-part safety and exploratory efficacy study uh and what i like about what we like about this study is that it was randomized uh if people are not familiarized with this is when people are assigned assigned randomly to a specific treatment or placebo in this case so it was assigned to thc and cbd on a ratio one to one that means that it has equal parts thc and cbd and or to the placebo which was i think really while while there were undergoing uh those intense hemosolomide treatment in patients with recurrent glucose stoma um so the first part it was only six patients and it was just to to try to see if it was safe and it was well tolerated by patients and they determined that it was so they moved on to the second part where 12 patients were assigned to to cbd and nine cbd and thc and nine patients were assigned to placebo uh in this case they were it was actually demonstrated that it was safe and it showed good results for survival um in this case it is one of the best studies i think um the only issue is that is a small sample and it cannot be generalized to everybody as you can as you can imagine uh the results of 12 patients can be generalized to millions of people so that that's the caveat in this study but it's a again it's a study a step in the right direction and i think that this is um setting the basis for further research and then uh on one of the society for neuroecology meetings uh dr nicholas blunden published this poster the developing role of complementary cannabis therapy and glioblastoma treatment and uh he at the university of jail he administered oil concentrate of at least 50 milligrams of cannabinoid per day uh for at least one month plus uh standard of care treatments this means radiation or chemotherapy so but it was just voluntaries uh it was not directed to specific patients so it was to whoever wanted to participate in the study so 23 patients were registered and 15 of those 23 were using cannabis so they observed good results compared to low use or no use of cannabis meaning they improved their symptoms and they improved their their more tumor improved or got stable but the issue uh and i wanted to to remark really these words it was at least 50 milligrams and at least one month this means that it was not the same concentration for everybody and it was not the same time for everybody that they were using so again uh it's a step in the right direction but it's not necessarily the best way we can not generalize with this type of results and then in 2004 on the on the opposite side of the coin let's say as you probably know there are other efforts that have been trying to show the hasterts of consuming cannabis and i i like this paper as a good example on how some evidence can be misleading so in in this paper what they did it was a retrospective which means they went back to the electronic medical records of patients over time of a large amount of people but it was 130 000 patients from kaiser uh who filled out the questionnaire from 1977 to 1985. what i think is interesting here is that it was very close to that initial paper that was released in 1975 so so maybe the people people actually didn't answer sincerely because of fear of being stigmatized by either the government or their other members of society but they were at least 25 years old and patients were followed for 21 years retrospectively they were not actually followed they were not calling them in real time for 21 years and he identified 19 000 20 000 to round up people who use cannabis at least once the issue with this is that he categorized all these patients as cannabis users and that's problematic because if you used only once let's say that these are uh recent grads or even grad students level or on in the age range they could have been trying just for fun and he categorized them as them using cannabis he found that nine patients who ever use cannabis at least once per month develop glioma so again this is problematic because out of the 130 000 patients that we started he derived conclusions out of nine patients so um we need to put in context uh not only from the research point of view but also in time what's happening in society at that point and what's the age of the group so i will take these results with a grain of salt and now so after we pulled all that information uh dr nicholas wutowski who you may or may not know and see in the clinic uh he's a neuro-ecologist and he's a director of clinical research in in our department he observed that a good proportion of his patients were using cannabis for some kind of issue for sleeping for anxiety and they were saying that they were feeling better however in science and in medicine we cannot just say because my neighbor told me that this works i'm going to prescribe it we need evidence so we decided to do a observational study observational means we are not doing any interventions we are not giving cannabis to anybody we are just surveying where we are asking people how they use it and this is because of the legal barriers mainly uh the federal legal barriers so so and and we want to see how cannabis is actually impacting the quality of life of our patients over time so we decided to use uh quality of life because that's our main goal is to improve quality of lives of our patients um and we want to see if there's any differences between people who use cannabis in real time versus those who don't use cannabis in real time so what we are doing is we are enrolling patients we ask them a series of questions and then we every three months we ask them the same questions slightly different but essentially it's the same idea to try to see what how they are feeling and for one year uh i understand that this is not the the best the ideal will be to following them until they they get better or until they don't want to keep participating anymore however we have certain time constrictions so so we follow them for one year and then we try to analyze uh what's happening with quality of life so therefore all patients can participate in this study we have people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis and both are equally helpful for our study because we need we need to see if it's working and we need to see uh we need a comparator group so this is uh and what we have found so far um uh today we have enrolled 81 patients in our study out of 216 we are aiming for that for that number 200 people is fairly balanced we have 50 50 males and 31 females and they have various degrees of using cannabis i think it's interesting that the the females that decided to participate are the most balanced so it's almost 50 50 split which is great for for results and for us to be able to drive conclusions and then generalize those and um these are the main reasons why people are using cannabis in our clinic this is not that they are being prescribed is mostly uh why what's the symptom that they or the the reason why people think that is helping them so we have the the majority of people is actually using it to relieve any kind of symptoms and i'm going to go over that shortly uh some people think that is use is is helping them for the tumor treatment and of course we have the recreational users which is totally fine and then we have other other symptoms and in other symptoms we include include sleep aid and anxiety relief we understand that this is a disease that can create anxiety in people and this is definitely a an important point to make so these are the specific symptoms why people are using um cannabis which um they're similar to what dr abrams showed us before uh on the survey on cbd and the dispensaries uh is slightly different and we have here that the majority of our population is using it for because they don't feel hungry because of anorexia and they are trying to improve their appetite and their their weight for anxiety for depression in other we said we are including here um other symptoms that are not don't fit in any of these categories for migraine and for sleep aid and the rest of them are um i don't i don't want to discard them just out of hand but i think these are the more important ones and interestingly enough pain relief is actually not one of the main reasons why people use cannabis in our clinic again this is self-reported this is people are using cannabis uh because they think that is helping them with this kind of symptoms one of the interesting questions that uh is pushing for this uh research study is that when we ask people before using cannabis how they felt and this is on a scale from one to six and six is the worst they have ever failed and one is the best status let's say that they can feel uh before using cannabis they report a four a score of four which is fairly high and after using cannabis it shrinks down to to 50 to two so almost normal uh again this is self report and i know this is subject to some things that we call bias and and this is for recall by us because we are just asking if you remember where how you felt before using cannabis please let us know how you felt so there may be some some biases there but i think this is this is still really interesting and it's a good motivator for us to try to explore more of what's happening here again this is self-reported it's not actually what's happening so now um to measure quality of life we use a series of instruments we call it so surveys really that have been validated in large amounts of people and and we try to compare this right so the bars when the when the bars uh overlay that that means that it's not statistically significant but i think it's interesting to see how users people who use cannabis actually feel more fatty more nausea and more pain this is interesting because we will expect the opposite however this is how people start when when they they initially go into our study this is how they start so now the interesting thing will be to see if three months from now this this curve actually switch and the people who don't use goes here and and the people oh sorry the people that don't use goes up and the people that use cannabis goes down that will be an interesting flip to see uh we don't have enough data yet to show you those those data but um this is the this is how is the baseline of our patients and same for functional scales uh this this is actually the opposite the higher the score it is the better it is and the lower the score it is the worse it is so uh physical functioning role functioning emotional functioning and cognitive functioning uh all these are actually statistically significant and again this is how people enter into our study and what we aim in the following months or years is to to evaluate this data on on a time lapse basis so the conclusion and we think that uh this phenomenon also that we are seeing of how people using cannabis are actually doing worse it's not because of cannabis that they were doing worse is because they feel they have more symptoms and therefore they resort to cannabis so we need to prove this over time of course and we have we think this because 58 of our patients have a high grade glioma which is an aggressive glioma so and they are subject to feel more symptoms and this is why we think this is true however we need to complete enrollment to further evaluate cannabis over time and compare to non-users so the general conclusions here is that more formal studies like this one even if they are observational are needed but if they are controlled uh in a more controlled environment like placebo compared to placebo or compared to different concentrations of cannabis are needed to to prove that it's actually working it's also important to know that there are some interactions that we may or may not know because it hasn't been studied and it can be interfering with treatments and other medications that patients might be taking so we need to know more about this and we definitely need involvement of community physicians scientists lawmakers especially and other stateholders is needed of course in community patients are included because this is this is mainly driven for the benefit of our patients and we remember that what is observed if you come across with some paper or some press release that it claims that cannabis is helping for x or y reason uh if it's only been tested in test tubes or animals that doesn't necessarily mean that is going to work the same in humans and this is why we need more research in humans so having said that this is an invitation for everybody to join the study again we welcome both types of persons people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis they are equally important to our study to to come if you have any questions you can reach out to me or you can reach out to the general clinical research coordinator line and if you scan this qr code if you have an iphone or a newer android you can scan it and it will take you to this flyer and you can have that information thank you thank you so much dr rick rodriguez that's really uh great information and i feel like we need to kind of put a pin in this and invite you back when we get more of your study results so um thank you um mary has put in the chat box uh the contact information so you have it um i apologize for the clicking sound i don't know if that's gonna resolve itself because um dr rodriguez's mic but uh hopefully it'll resolve itself now so now we're going to turn it back over to dr abrams and really talk about what this might mean for you and some practical considerations thank you naomi uh really appreciated dr rodriguez's presentation and i i do want to note that many studies have uh found that same finding that the people that are using cannabis at the beginning uh have more symptoms and maybe that's why they turn to cannabis because they're not getting relief from their conventional therapies so what does all this mean let's put it together first of all often we're asked what is the best way for me to consume cannabis i see a lot of older women with cancer who go to the dispensary and they're told only eat a quarter of the cookie these are people that feel that inhalation is bad and eating is good so they eat a quarter of the cookie and nothing happens so they eat another quarter and nothing happens so they eat the whole cookie and then they call me three days later after perhaps a visit to the emergency room with a not very good feeling saying they're never going to do that again so they're describing the pharmacokinetics or what happens when we take thc by mouth it takes a very long time to reach a peak plasma concentration about two and a half hours and there's a delayed onset of activity which is why people say nothing's happened so they they consume more by mouth and then when you take the delta nine thc the main psychoactive ingredient by mouth when it goes through the liver on the so-called first pass metabolism the liver breaks the delta ix thc down into an even more psychoactive metabolite so that's why people get more zonk if you will when they eat edible products on the other hand if you inhale cannabis either via smoking or vaporizing not vaping i hate vaping that's the wrong word i'm sorry vaporizing then the effect is much more rapid the peak plasma concentration occurs in two and a half minutes and very rapidly declines over the next 30 minutes and since less of it goes through the liver than when you take it by mouth you create less of that 11 hydroxy more psychoactive metabolite so i tell patients if they would want better onset over better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect that inhalation is probably better than oral ingestion and when i say inhalation i mean vaporizing which means vaporizing the plant i've as an oncologist i've been quite concerned about this trend towards vaporizing an oil because i definitely know the long-term health effects of inhaling a vaporized or combusted plant but not an oil and i think that panned out to be a concern so i'm all in favor of vaporizing plant or even smoking in a bong or even cigarettes because i don't think the danger is very large we now have tinctures and oils and in fact even chewing gums and when you put these in your mouth you immediately absorb some from under the tongue and then except for the chewing gum you swallow the oil or the tincture so you get the sort of benefit of both inhalation and oral ingestion and i think more and more people are turning to these oils and tinctures people also in my practice have claimed that suppositories work who grows all the cannabis for the government research said that he doesn't think thc could be absorbed rectally but many of my patients make their own suppositories out of olive oil or coconut oil i forget and they say it definitely works and then there are topical products that patients often can use and get at a dispensary and find them very useful for local pain in arthritic joints or or muscle pain so there are many many different options for cannabis now again as an oncologist i am quite anti-sugar i think sugar is the worst thing that patients with cancer patients without cancer could consume so i am not a fan of the chocolate chip cookies that you see there i don't think edible cannabis products are ever medicine because of the sugar so as i said for better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect i feel inhalation is optimal it achieves the higher peak concentration and a shorter duration effect the slow onset of ingested cannabis may prompt one to overdose i mean you it's not like an overdose on an opiate you just feel uncomfortable and you need to get in a dark room and sort of lie down again the topical products uh probably have less systemic absorption uh and may have some benefits systemically but are probably best used locally so what are the potential side effects of cannabis well again particularly if people are not used to using it dizziness is possible especially if you stand up too quickly cannabis can increase the pulse rate and it can increase or decrease the blood pressure and that's why people who use cannabis and then stand up too quickly may experience dizziness dry mouth is common and again drowsiness is that a side effect or a desired effect i think for people who are looking for help with sleep it might be a good thing euphoria again there's that sort of being high is that a side effect or is that a desired effect uh you know i guess it's all not i have a beholder i certainly think that people who have a life-threatening disease are entitled to have some euphoria i think cannabis induced euphoria in my opinion is much healthier than the intoxicating effects of alcohol the blood pressure changes i mentioned red eyes headaches relaxed muscles and then there are some people uh who get paranoid uh increased anxious or depression and that's not good impaired memory is something that happens acutely but uh people who use cannabis chronically uh don't have any evidence of impaired learning or other cognitive issues on long-term follow-up tests we're often asked well what is the right dose and you know who knows what product people are talking about so it's highly individualized again everybody's cannabinoid receptors may be genetically different so some people smoke cannabis and they always get euphoric and some people smoke cannabis and get depressed and some people get paranoid and some people get no effect that could be set or setting it could be the cannabis that you have but it also could be the genetics of your cannabinoid receptors so giving a dose is difficult what we tell people this should be in quotes and have a s-i-c in parentheses after it because it's not grammatically correct but it rhymes so we like to say start low and go slow so start at the lowest possible dose and increase slowly to get to achieve the desired effect somebody asked the question 50 milligrams seems like a high dose while dr rodriguez was talking and i didn't catch whether that was thc which would be a high dose or cbd which in fact would not be a high dose because clinical trials of cbd have looked at up to 600 milligrams that's one thing about cbd people take from 10 to 600 milligrams that's a quite a wide range so again start low and go slowly but it's the mantra is go slow and then again you know talk to your doctor and see if they can help studies have shown that most physicians although they're in favor of medical cannabis don't really know enough about it to advise the patient so what i do is i tell the patients go to the dispensary tell the bud tender or the person behind the desk what it is you're trying to treat and ask them what might work another question that we get all the time is what is the right ratio of cbd to thc that i should take and again in animals cbd seems to reduce the psychotropic effects or the high if you will of thc when the ratio is eight to one or greater cbd increases the psychotropic effects of thc when the ratio is two to one or less so that's all in animals unfortunately and we don't really know that from humans and this little uh 18 to one eight to one four to one two to one one to one comes from care by design cbd which is a cbd uh company and this is what they uh postulate are the effects of the different ratios i tell my patients that the only ratio that's been studied in the medical literature is one to one and that is what the drug nabixamols is which is the drug that 12 patients got in the study that dr rodriguez described compared to the nine patients getting placebo so particularly for my patients with brain tumors who ask me what they should take i say well the medical literature right now supports a one-to-one ratio of cbd to thc so other safety concerns again older people people with cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease should be cautious i never say avoid really but should be cautious about use of cannabis and both thc and cbd interact with the system in the liver that breaks down prescription medications particularly cbd may cause a inhibition of that system so that prescription drugs are going to build up in the bloodstream and could become more toxic so that's why i'm often concerned about my patients who are taking these very highly concentrated oils of cbd or thc fearful that it may alter the dose of their prescribed medications leading to potential toxicity in our studies of the medical literature we really found that the only adverse effect in the lungs in people who smoke cannabis is increased uh cough and sputum consistent with chronic bronchitis we in fact did not see any evidence of increased lung cancer perhaps even some suggestion of decreased lung cancer and again people who have had bad experiences with cannabis excessively paranoid or depressed or too anxious should probably avoid it and then there's this rare condition that we're learning more and more about as more people use cannabis on a regular basis hyperemesis which means uh too much vomiting so you get repeated and severe bouts of vomiting uh in some patients it's a rather idiosyncratic reaction i would say because we think of cannabis as being an anti-nausea and vomiting medication but some people i guess because it's working in the brain on that center might get it triggered in the wrong direction and there are medications that people use to treat this some antipsychotic medications or many people say taking a warm shower is very helpful so do not drive if you're under the influence of cannabis is a recommendation that we're going to make but you know i'll tell you what studies are very unclear about what's happened in states where cannabis has become available recreationally whether or not there's increase in auto accidents is unclear and i think that people under the influence of cannabis actually are safer drivers than people under the influence of alcohol when this has been studied in laboratory conditions people under the influence of cannabis tend to drive more slowly and they weave a bit more but they stay within their lane this is quite different from alcohol when we looked at the adverse effect on newborns in women who used cannabis during pregnancy we did not see that many babies were born with a slightly lower birth weight but otherwise there were no long-term damaging effects but we're going to recommend that if you are pregnant you might want to avoid cannabis although many women who have prolonged morning sickness have found it very useful in the 60s and 70s and i think their children came out pretty normal so i just want to share a little bit about when you go to a dispensary you might be overwhelmed by the selection of products that are available so this is a menu from a dispensary that was online that i took a screenshot of you can see that the names people have done studies on these names and green dragon at this dispensary is not going to be necessarily the same plant as green dragon at that dispensary there's indoor and outdoor well why do they tell us the difference between indoor and outdoor well cannabis connoisseurs believe that you can really tell if something is grown outdoors in the sun and wind and rain or indoors under fluorescent lights and artificial fans and hydroponic water dripping or whatever so uh you know people feel that maybe indoor sometimes is a little more jangly as they say then they tell you if it's a sativa or indica and most of what you get in dispensaries are a blend of sativa indica it's unusual to get a pure product sativa in the folklore is felt to be up and mental whereas the indica is felt to be more down and physical so if you're having trouble sleeping you probably don't want a sativa if you're having trouble getting motivated you're not going to want an indica dominant blend and then this dispensary was just starting to look at cbd content the third one down has more cbd than thc the top two are the opposite and then they give you a little wine spectator one-liner a bright and cerebral sativa with euphoric overtones so you know we've come a long way in the cannabis world cannabis business i find a lot of patients that i see however are older a little confused they take a lot of different medications and they don't really want to go to a dispensary so a few years ago two pharmd's two pharmacists graduating from ucsf school of pharmacy came to me and said what would you think if we opened a dispensary and i said well that would be great so a year and a half later they came back and said you know what we found out it cost a million dollars down to open a dispensary so instead we started a concierge cannabis practice where we'll talk to patients and for a monthly fee we'll find out what meds they're taking what they want to treat and we'll send them as part of the monthly fee a tincture that we make up for them so many of my patients have benefited from talking to the folks at med1 specialty care their phone number is listed there in the spirit of full disclosure they want me to be more involved as a consultant and an advisor but we have at this point in time no financial relationship so i do offer this to people that are not cannabis sophisticated that might want to experiment with some cannabis products but aren't interested in going to a dispensary and being overwhelmed with all the selections that are available which certainly when i was growing up in the 60s was not a problem that we worried about so with that i'll thank you for your attention and hopefully we have time to answer some questions thank you so much dr abrams that's really wonderful information um dr rodriguez i'm going to invite you back up we do have questions uh that we had in the queue and please feel free to submit your questions using the q a function we do have about 10 minutes for questions so here's one of them i think i'm going to direct this to you dr abrams can you overdose if you consume too much cannabis again the uh overdosing usually means you know dying and and having your respirations turned off there are very few cannabinoid receptors in the brainstem which is where our respiratory center is so in fact there has never been a report of an overdose and it said that you would need to smoke 700 cigarettes in a very short time to overdose and that would be from carbon monoxide poisoning and not from cannabis poisoning thank you so much here's a question that came in um what are your thoughts on rso i don't know what that means but maybe you know yeah it's named after uh somebody who's currently on the lam this is a highly concentrated uh full cannabis extract oil that is being touted as being a cure for cancer and as dr rodriguez told us there is very little evidence in the medical literature that cannabis cures cancer i think if cannabis is going to have any benefit in any cancer it's going to be brain tumors because of the high concentration of the cannabinoid receptor in the brain but this oil and i'm not going to say the name of the man who is rs because i don't think he deserves that sort of publicity is something that's sold to patients and it's what i said i was concerned about highly concentrated oils being able to interact with people's other medications in a negative fashion so that those medications may become more toxic thank you so much um dr rodriguez this might be for you or for you as well dr abrams of email do you know if um medical cannabis is covered by insurance the answer is no no okay all right and for your study as well um eduardo it's there's no uh coverage as well they have to get it on their own and purchase it on their own as part of your study yeah but there's no cost for that it's just link surveys so there's no cost to be part of the study uh the only caveat that we have is that we we prefer people who are being treated at ucsf just because we also are pulling data from their medical records to to be a little bit more detailed on what information we get so if you come from outside of ucsf you will have to share those with us separately and that will that will be another layer but we can discuss if people are interested thank you so much um okay how do i know how many milligrams i'm getting if i'm smoking rather than using a tincture is there a measurement no no you don't know okay okay um and what sort of vaporizer would you suggest people buy any opinions on that well i mean we studied the so-called volcano vaporizer which is not a portable you know all of the studies that we've done have been done in the in-patient setting in the general clinical center research center at zuckerberg san francisco general the volcano is a table top centrifuge it looks like with a turkey basting bag was the original thing that you use to fill up by a heating element and a fan fills up this bed the company that makes the volcano stores in bickel has a number of uh hand-held portable vaporizers uh they are again much more intricate than a vape pen where you inhale oil um as i mentioned very concerned about inhaling oil into the lungs as a potential way to damage it so i would go for a portable vaporizer some people enjoy having their own volcano it's not cheap but it does deliver a vaporized cannabis which is probably associated with less harmful particulate matter than actually smoking a cigarette but a water pipe is also an acceptable way okay thank you so much and this is kind of a little bit of dovetailing on that what is the difference between vaporizing and vaping could you explain that again because you mentioned that in your i mean people people make use them synonymously but i think vaping has really come to be the term used for those little you know things where there's oil in one end and you inhale and it heats the oil and you're inhaling heated oil that is vaporizing an oil but that's become synonymous with vaping and oil vapor rising is heating to below the point of combustion the plant and inhaling that those vapors from the plant that hasn't been heated to the point where it's going to flame up and become ash but where it's just going to vaporize the active chemicals so i'm all in favor of vaporization but vaping has become a nickname for vaporization and i think it means something else okay thank you um in any of these studies how can you account for the possibility that people don't want to mention anything about their use of cannabis for example it's stigmatizing for their career um dr rodriguez do you want to address that first and then okay yeah uh fortunately this information that uh at least in the united states all the information that we collect is protected by hipaa so we do not disclose it and even if we share this information with others like we do in scientific meetings uh we do not disclose any any information that we call identifiers meaning dates of birth uh workplaces uh names uh even initials sometimes uh we change all those things to to be as anonymous as possible and um at least in our study of course this is study by study but in our study that information that is given to us does not go into the medical record so it's not subject to be reviewed by insurance or other third parties it just stays there for research purposes do you feel that that's the same for other studies as well they would protect that information uh in in our practice in our clinic yes um elsewhere i will i can speak for them okay thank you all right is there likely to be much political motivation either party democrats or republicans to remove cannabinoids from schedule one with dea federal government if not how is the cycle ever broken to do more research um rely on international studies anybody want to take that it's a very difficult question actually it involves many layers from my standpoint i think it's going to come down and probably dr abrams can say his own opinion is going to come down to how much money can people make unfortunately uh rather than how house impacting actually people's lives i don't know if there's i'm pretty sure there should be a partisan division there but i don't know if one side is more inclined to to move forward than the other well i think we'll just have to wait and see what comes up in the debates but uh my namesake the current has been the best president we've ever had on cannabis i have to say and it's because of what you said dr rodriguez he's a businessman and he appreciates that it's money and taxes and now pretty much every state has medical cannabis and even recreational cannabis and his opponent has always been an anti-drug person so i'm a little concerned okay thank you um there is a question about sugar use but i think i'm just we might table that um because that's a big discussion in and of itself and maybe we'll do another talk about sugar and cancer um so i'm going to read this question out this is one that that might be um difficult to answer because it's quite specific but dr abrams and dr rodriguez if you had an oligodendroglioma and it was 40 surgically resected would you go on a cbd thc regiment to hopefully resolve the remaining tumor so i'm just going to read a little bit more i do occasionally take um 90 to 90 10 ratio of cbd thc gummies in hopes that it will cure me i have no issues with my traditional cancer treatment side effects i only take these on hope to eliminate the remaining tumor so this is about tumor reduction any any thoughts about that for oligodendroglioma um yeah like we we uh stated before i think that um people need to be treated on a case-by-case basis uh these results that we are giving out on research is on the general level it's not an individual specific um but but like we mentioned we don't have uh the medical evidence to say that this will help in humans at least at least not not right now yeah i think that's the saddest thing i see in my practice or patients who are treating a potentially treatable sorry my dogs are being fed now people with a potentially treatable malignancy uh maybe not a brain tumor but who come to me having waited to see me for a number of months who now have a disease that can't be cured so i would say no you need to treat the remaining tissue the way dr rodriguez and his team would say to treat it and do not think that cbd or thc in any ratio will work thank you so much and i i think we're we'll have time for maybe just one quick question if you if you could um stay for one more uh why is thc associated with prop 65 label identified by the state of california to be a carcinogen to cause reproductive harm anybody want to take that one i think they have to say that about pretty much anything that they don't know enough about okay okay well i think that's all the time we have for questions from uh dr for dr abrams and dr rodriguez i want to thank you both so much for your time your expertise we really really appreciate it and um thank you again for for being here and thank you to all of you for joining us for this presentation it's wonderful to have you here we wish you well and hope to see you again in a

would make some CBD infused muscle rub so muscle rub is a tough thing because a lot of people have their favorites but a lot of times they don't really know what's in it and so it's nice to have something a little bit more natural and it's also nice to be able to add the benefits of CBD so today we're actually going to be using two different types of CBD it is absolutely not necessary you can use either CB oil or you can use CV flour today we're going to use a little mixture of both just to add a little bit more liquid to the mix so what we're going to start with is our dry ingredients so what I've done is I've got a little bit of cheesecloth here and we're gonna put all our dry ingredients into it and form almost like a little tea bag so that we can drop it into the mixture and it will be a little bit less cleanup later on so what I've done to start actually is I've made a double boiler so I have that turned on and running right now the heat is just on low I just want the water should be hot I don't want it to boil underneath there and boil away on us so now that that is ready to go once we add all our ingredients that will start to melt together and we'll leave it sit for a little while so I have in this container this little glass I have 10 grams of CBD flour and a little bit of shake as well in there so we're just gonna add that onto our little pile here there we go the next thing we're gonna add is some cloves so cloves actually have a slight numbing feeling so that will definitely be a good add to our mixture here so I have I want to say 15 yes 15 clove pieces in here you can use clove essential oil as well I just didn't happen to have any in my kitchen so we're just gonna pop that on the pile the next thing we're gonna add is some cinnamon so cinnamon as you may or may not know has lots of anti-inflammatory properties I'm just using sugar from my kitchen or sorry cinnamon out of the kitchen but you can use cinnamon sticks or you can use cinnamon essential oil this is a little bit powdery but because it's going to be mixed in with everything else I don't think it's going to go through the cheesecloth so I've used about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder and the last dry ingredient we're gonna add is some red crushed red peppers so crushed red peppers are gonna add a little bit of heat to this mixture so it's going to be kind of a cold hot kind of a feeling once you put it on your skin we're not adding a lot I happen to have an allergy to peppers so I can get away with using a little bit but not very much plus with all these ingredients that we're going to be adding a lot of them anyway they do have some irritants if you happen to rub your eyes or touch other parts of your body things like you like to put it in your mouth or on your lip so a little bit goes a long way so again I'm using about quarter of teaspoon just under a quarter of a teaspoon of crushed red peppers perfect so now all we're gonna do is gather this up as best we can and we're gonna make a little tea bag I guess you'd call it squish this up just like that give it a good squeeze we want it nice and tight there so now what I've done is I've just cut a little piece of kitchen string this is what you'd normally used to like tie a turkey at Christmas or Thanksgiving so we're just going to wrap this around this is just organic cotton so it won't add anything that we don't want into our mixture and leave a little bit at the end so we can tie it just like that perfect there you go so this is all of our dry ingredients ready to go and now we can start to add our wet ingredients the first thing we're going to add is I haven't here a quarter of a cup of melted shea butter I only melted it to get my measurement right but inside you can put it in as a big clump if you want to not a big deal either way so we're going to add that right into the bowl on top here there we go perfect ya know there are also obviously some benefits to shea butter shea butter is full of fatty acids which is really really good for your skin it has a very kind of high concentration so it's actually excellent for your skin but also it has some alien flare anti-inflammatory properties so of course it's the perfect addition for what we're making today the next thing we have is a quarter of a cup of sweet almond oil so sweet almond oil also very good for your skin it contains lots of vitamin E so it's gonna keep your skin nice and soft so we can't leave that out so pour that in just like that see if this will fit in here there's so much air as we can go good so now I'm just gonna add this little tea bag in as well just because we've got some liquid here so we're gonna put that in and we're just gonna kind of get it nice and saturated if we can and then we can get that started perfect all right so the next additions are small ones we've got lots of little containers here now I will put links on the website for all of these things so what we're using is some camphor and some peppermint essential oil we have our CBD oil as well I'm using the aurora and so the other thing we're adding is some eucalyptus oil I didn't happen to have any of my usual essential oil left in the eucalyptus so I just picked this up at the drugstore it's gonna suit the purposes the eucalyptus oil is and 80 and flama thick so like you can smell it in there it's gonna do just fine sometimes you have to just go with whatever you can so we're going to put all these in here there's only little bits of these as well this isn't a super big recipe so we're adding 45 drops of camphor we're adding 20 drops of eucalyptus and 30 drops of peppermint essential oil there now we're gonna add our CBD oil the CBD oil I'm adding is a hundred milliliters so about four full droppers out of your bottle if you have a 30ml bottle go perfect now the last thing we're gonna add is some beeswax pellets beeswax pellets are going to help sort of hold the whole mixture together but we're not using enough to make it back into a solid as these actual beeswax pellets we're using a lot of liquid in this recipe so when we're finished it should actually have quite a nice easy rubbing consistency so we're just gonna drop those in as well and we'll get up that all melting along so this is going to be done the same way as any other infusion with decarboxylated the flour that we're using which we always do and now this is just gonna sit and melt all together for about four hours and then we'll come back and get it put into some little containers and it'll be ready to go all right so we will check back in with you in four hours okay we are back it has been four hours and we've got our mixture all ready to go so we're just gonna pop this out of the water it's still a little bit hot so we need to be very careful so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this tea bag we're going to squeeze it out and get as much out as we can so I picked up this cool little contraption at winners one day and I think it's gonna be perfect for the job because I don't have very strong hands so this will help me maximize it so we're just going to pop that in there I'm gonna give it a squeeze there's so much stuck in there get as much as we can there we go I think that's pretty good there we go so here's our mixture let's put that down we've got our mixture here there's not a lot here like I said but we're going to put this into some containers and then it's gonna be ready to go so what I've done previously is I sprayed these containers out with some rubbing alcohol just to make sure that they're nice and clean inside and so now all we need to do is just pour this mixture let me just get a little scraper there we go now it does set fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad I'm not sure we're gonna need to but put all the extras in there and it's already starting to harden in the bowl so you got to work a little bit quick and if it does cool down and start to solidify again you can just pop it into your hot water and that should soften it back up okay so we are back and our muscle rub is all hardened it actually has not too too strong to smell it's quite nice actually and when you go to use it it comes off fairly easily so it's nice and easy to rub on your skin just like that wherever you hurt and it rubs in quite nicely and easily so there you go you got some homemade CBD infused muscle rub which is awesome if you keep it in the fridge it'll probably last you about a year if you don't use it up first and also if you buy some nice little containers they make nice little gifts for people as well so let's fit on nice there you go you can get some little stickers to write a little label on them and I can already feel it starting to work so that is really nice and I think you'll enjoy it too so thank you very much for joining me in this episode of the cannabis kitchen I hope that you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it it's a nice easy recipe I will put the links in on the website if you go into the cannabis infused recipe section at www.canadianoutback.com look into doing that for you as well we actually had this one in the works to make and somebody did request it so that worked out good so whoever was looking for it I hope you enjoyed this particular recipe you can make changes as you wish you can add more camphor which is really good to reduce inflammation you can add more CBD or less just make sure that you're not messing around too much just because you don't want to mix up and get a really runny batch or a really really hard batch that you can't rub on so play around with it enjoy it if you have anything that you would want to add to your balm then by all means let me know in the comments I would love to know how you guys make yours and again please join us on our website Canadian wheat farm calm we've got lots of really great people there it's a really great community everyone's very helpful and if you have any questions you can ask them there we don't limit ourselves to recipes there's information about growing there's information about how to use different types of cannabis or CBD and lots of other things going on there but also too we would love some of your knowledge so if you would like to join in and maybe answer some other people's questions that would be really really helpful as well so again I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please hit the like button and we would absolutely love it if you subscribed it really does help us keep this going [Music]", "AIhELWPJcO8": "[Music] Aya's Madden roughhouse Studios and welcome to cannabase --ax today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused cocoa butter [Music] cocoa butter is a pale yellow edible vegetable fat it's extracted from the cocoa bean and is used to make chocolate as well as many ointments toiletries and pharmaceuticals cocoa butter has a natural chocolatey flavor and aroma and also has a high saturated fat content making it a good vehicle for infusing cannabis in order to do this we're going to need about a 1/2 ounce of dried cannabis - a 1 pound or 16 ounces of food grade cocoa butter and optionally you need 1 teaspoon of soy lecithin powder and to do this year we're going to be using an oven - decarboxylate err cannabis and a double boiler setup to do the infusion you could also use an infusion machine like the mighty fast herbal and fuser and you can save $30 on the mighty fast herbal infuser with a co roughhouse at the herbal infuser calm but to thank them for sponsoring this episode the first step is going to be to grind and decarboxylate our cannabis so what I'm doing now is I've weighed out 1/2 pounds of cannabis and I'm grinding it go make sure I pull out any big stems and any seeds that I may have once I have it all ground up I also want to put this into a dish where I can spread it out evenly so I'm using this large glass there's just so we can see it in the video but whatever big dish you have you can spread it out nice and even so it'll cook even we're gonna put that in the oven preheated at 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna let that D card for 25 minutes [Music] now when you're making cannabis infused cocoa butter you want to make sure that you're using food grade cocoa butter there's other cocoa butters that you could get that aren't necessarily designed for you to eat it might be used to make our hair products or something like that or candles so make sure that you're getting food grade and I'll put links to where you can get that on Amazon okay and we're going to be putting our 1 pound of cocoa butter into a double boiler that's got boiling water underneath it and we're gonna let that melt let's go take a few minutes to melt but I should take about the same amount of time as it took to decarboxylate our cannabis so by the time that 25 minutes is gone by you're also going to have your cocoa butter nice and melted nice and hot so it's that point cannabis is out and we're going to be able to add that into our cocoa butter and this is much like infusing butter or infusing any other kind of oil such as olive oil or coconut oil which we've done before and so it's going to be a very similar process we're going to be letting this infuse for one to two hours [Music] notice I'm letting that infuse without a lid on it and I'm doing that because I don't want the condensation to build up and let any water drip through so you want to avoid letting any water comment on contact with this especially if you're making chocolate but once we have our infusion down we're going to filter that out now filter the plant material out and you can do that with cheesecloth or a cotton muslin bag or a filtration bag if you're using the mighty fast turbulent fuser you'll have that HEPA filtration bag that's included with that we're using a fine mesh filter which works perfect you see we were done there our cocoa butter is now a much darker colored and has been infused with that cannabis has a lot of different flavor now and I've put that in the refrigerator for a little while so it'll harden up and you can see what it looks like but it hardens up very brittle like chocolate it'll have that snap to it and you can use this for a lot of different things you may notice at the bottom it looks like there's a puddle of brown stuff but that's a very very thin just a little color layer there of some very fine sediment that's filtered through and that's nothing to worry about and you could use like a vegetable peeler and just break that off if it bothered you very much but it really just is a very thin layer so I'm just chopping it up now so I could store it and you can store this for as long as you want in the

research for disabled children when we were seniors in high school the teachers sent it back to us and it was kind of neat to see that I was going on to be a research scientist making the tools that doctors can provide to patients I was introduced to cannabis as my brother was working at a construction company and was asked to build a dispensary and through that effort became more aware of the whole community went out into the public and started talking to some of the individual patients and I myself had my own medicinal need so I was curious how much could this be effective for me which types of medicines might be best THC and CBD are both used across medicinal use and adult use THC is rather psychoactive where CBD is not really early you can see research that suggests CBD might be very helpful when you go talk to a lot of the dispensaries they're not really aware of what CBD or a non psychoactive use of cannabis might be like what if a lab was present and could tell them how do we really start to put medicine into medicinal cannabis when we first started that was the first question was why would you ever touch that stuff well when you look at it in a different fashion when you understand that it could be very beneficial in therapeutic uses helping you know epileptic children or other individuals who might be ailing or helping people reduce their opioid use you can look at cannabis in a much broader fashion than just THC rates patient here in Southern California I was really concerned about HIV meds that promotes cancer on the long term side effects I started having tumors in my head my ears my temple CBD it erupted cancer drove so I started making tinctures for myself the picture is a liquid form of cannabis I notice my autoimmune system was really starting to kick down though I'm really fine and life's good I rely a lot on the lavatories reports I want to make sure that it does not have any a mold or mildew and safe for people to just the predominant amount of work that happens here is analytical chemistry so what molecules are present in which products I can figure out how to say this type of cannabis product is going to be best for this consumer I really have a winning solution lawmakers have established the laws now the regulator has to establish the rules and details of those laws so they're really leaning on laboratories in their experience to say hey scientists that are out there that have thought about these problems what do we need to know as a regulator so that we can get these rules set up in the right fashion we have to educate through research and scientific understanding these professional associations such as the American Chemical Society have message boards they have networking event and they're all geared towards bringing these people together who have been largely isolated in the past through the cannabis chemistry subdivision we're seeking to validate the good works that people are doing and provide additional collaboration opportunities and ways for people to explore this expanding space the world is very bright for chemists to get engaged inside of cannabis and really take a fresh look at it and say how do we harness this natural resource that we could use in different types of ways to improve society and the world around us [Music]", "yjOJfmTRq2Y": ">>> FROM PITTSBURGH,\nTRANSFORMING.

eczema by dr peter leo i'm isabelle tebow senior manager of community research and i manage nia survey research which generally aims to gather information from many individuals about the eczema patient experience so we can better understand how to improve the health and quality of life of those living with eczema we'd like to thank our 2020 webinar wednesday sponsor sanofi genzyme and regeneron whose unrestricted educational grant has made today's presentation possible our presenter today is peter leo md fellow of the american academy of dermatology dr leo is a clinical assistant professor of dermatology and pediatrics at northwestern university's feinberg school of medicine and the founding director of the chicago integrative eczema center his clinical practice is at medical dermatology associates associates of chicago dr leo is a member of nia's board of directors and nia scientific and medical advisory council and with that i am pleased to introduce our presenter dr peter leo hi i'm dr peter leo and today we're going to be talking about cannabis and eczema what are the facts i'm just going to share my screen these are my disclosures let's jump right in this cover back in september of 2019 really caught my attention high on the hype the cover of newsweek pop culture says marijuana cures everything but what do scientists say and this really i think captures the zeitgeist of the moment cannabinoids and cannabis have really been talked about in this incredibly positive light as having all sorts of potential and i want to explore that with you guys for about the next half hour lots and lots of research has been happening and we can see the research in cannabinoids in general that's the general category that includes cannabis but all of its derivatives and we're going to get into in a moment we can see the studies in the 1990s look at 2000 and look it happened in 2010 things went crazy we're going practically vertical here blasting up with all these studies and look none of these are actually skin cancer neurological disorders schizophrenia anxiety multiple sclerosis epilepsy so lots and lots of different areas are being studied in addition to the skin the skin industry has seen a massive impact from this and this was a really nice uh comment under a section called comet controversy and they called it the growing trend of cannabidiol cbd which is one of those cannabinoids in skin care products and this is again just calling attention to how common this is getting and we're hearing more and more about it this was a really nice editorial from peter cogan and i like this a lot the title of this piece was on health care by popular appeal critical assessment of benefit and risk and cannabidiol-based dietary supplements and i think we're seeing again a big interest a lot of public outcry let's let's have these let's use them how how do we get them to us and i think that's exciting we want to we want to learn but i also want to make sure we're doing it cautiously and intelligently and carefully because you know if we look at the history of medicine we haven't been burned before we've embraced things very quickly and very openly only to find out later oh we rushed in maybe we made the wrong decision and the quote here that i really like is quote ongoing lack of meaningful regulation of cannabinoid supplements continues to put consumers at undue risk without clear evidence of therapeutic value unquote so we just want to be careful as we go into this now in dermatology we're a little bit buffered because we're going to be talking about some of the more genital approaches to this but i still think it's important we know cannabis marijuana has a very long and celebrated history there actually is mention of it in the ebers papyrus one of the most ancient forms of egyptian medicine that remains ancient documents it also here is pictured above the goddess seshat the goddess of wisdom knowledge and writing and then uh here on the syrian clay tablets so it's been around for a long time people have known to to greater or lesser degrees that it has been part of us in our culture and it has long been used for health and healing the preparations from the flowers and resin have been used in china for about 5 000 years it's been used for fever malaria constipation menstrual disorders gout rheumatism and pain and before aspirin i didn't know this but i learned this in reading reading a lot of the background history uh cannabis was a common pain remedy in western medicine in the 1800s i didn't realize that kind of interesting that you would just have some cannabis instead of popping an aspirin now so we've said that word cannabis which is sort of equivalent to marijuana and then we think about the chemicals from that plant right the cannabis plant what are the chemicals that group of the ones we're talking about here one of the groups the ones that we're interested are called cannabinoids so that's the group of molecules that have anti-inflammatory anti-itch and pain relieving properties among others they do show promise in treating eczema and other skin conditions with multiple possible routes of administration and importantly because sometimes people get confused they can be made and i think should be made in our case to have no psychoactive stuff so you think of somebody getting high on marijuana that's not what we're going for that's not that's not the look we're going for here that is um a very different part and it turns out that that part getting high is one particular cannabinoid in fact it's the tetrahydrocannabinol we'll look at that in a moment but that is different we're not so interested in that for our skin there are different classes of cannabinoids that come up and the first group is called the endocannabinoids those the ones that inside the body uh a-e-a-p-e-a-o-e-a-a then there are the phytocannabinoids the ones from plants phytos plants and that's the delta 9 tetrahydrocannabidiol cannabinol that's the thc that that is the one that's psychogenic and other ones cvg and cbdv and then there are some synthetic ones as well now pea we're going to talk about an oea they're not technically real cannabinoids they are just sort of binder enhancers they just kind of help but they function in a very similar way this is the crazy biochemistry pathway they start with these activated fatty acids and they go through a number of different synthesis pathways to get some of the big guys here's the dial to 9 thc here's cbd and some other ones too they have lots of different characteristics so the tetrahydrocannabida cannabinol thc is the psychoactive one but it turns out pretty much none of the other ones really are psychoactive which is kind of fascinating that really is the outlier in a way and that's most abundant in the drug type plants because we know hemp is really the same as cannabis marijuana it's the same plant but they've been bred slightly differently so the hemp ones have very little thc and they're more fiber and oil and then the marijuana plants have a lot more of the delta 9 thc cbd is one that we're really interested in dermatology it's non-psychoactive it's the most abundant in the fiber type plants or the hemp type plans and it really it can have an effect on these different types of receptors so we mentioned that it's been studied for many disorders so look at this pain multiple sclerosis anorexia nausea vomiting colitis you name it so lots and lots of things have had studies for different types of cannabinoids and more appropriately for our work is the anti-inflammatory stuff because when we think about a lot of the problems we're facing in dermatology and particularly for our for eczema it's the anti-inflammatory and anti-itch and again there's been lots and lots of studies here we can see pretty exciting one of the big things that are holding this back a hurdle is that there are still regulatory issues this is still listed by federal sources as a schedule one controlled substance so that's very different than you know in a lot of states has been legalized even for recreational use but from a federal standpoint it's still tricky and it's sort of slipping in at least the cbd products because the 1994 passage of the dietary supplement health education act created this big group of products called dietary supplements which we know you know you can see infomercials there at every store um and they get to kind of skirt around a lot of the regulatory stuff it was a very powerful act that was pushed very hard by these makers of different supplements said listen this is an important industry we want consumers to be able to have these options we don't want the fda in everything and that's sort of how some of these can get through there and many states say treat them more like dietary supplements which can be a good thing it can mean that again less regulation can mean much better availability cheaper prices of course it does have a negative side and that means it's the wild west sometimes we don't know if what they say you're getting is what you're really getting and we've actually written a couple of papers about this recently that many of my patients say well how do i know like even though it's legal in for example in illinois my job says it's not legal my job will fire me if i fail the drug test so if i'm using a cbd product on my skin can you assure me that i won't fail the drug test for marijuana exposure and it's a really important question and it's nuanced because it has a few steps the first is if they really do put what they're saying in there if it's just cbd at the percent they're saying and the patient's using it the way we expect then we can answer that question it turns out the answer to that question is almost for sure you'd be fine but because it's not regulated we don't know if they're really putting in just what they're saying they're putting in and the right percentage so that really throws things off so there are a couple layers that that make it a little confusing so we know the the fda then really does not limit these or regulate these which is good but the problem here is that we don't have a ton of data on these so despite all the people talking about them despite being on the fact of newsweek you're going to see i think kind of a frightening lack of information you know when we really really look at what's out there and some people talk on it with such uh confidence and expertise like they were like they know and i'm thinking gosh how do you know even if you've been recommending it to a lot of patients it's still we know that there's a lot of inherent dangers to just your anecdotal experience right and so it's fascinating to think that we haven't we want these so much and we have so much information about them but yet we have so little when it comes to actually using them in patients not a single product sold as a cannabinoid supplement has been assessed through a large randomized controlled phase three clinical trial so for better or worse now it probably doesn't matter if you're taking a zinc supplement right at this point um that hasn't been passed through anything either but you know it just it just may vary and i think it just opens up the question so cbd at the center of all these possible things neuroprotective pain relieving anxiety relieving antidepressant antioxidant and more how is it doing all this well this is a look at the endocannabinoid system in the skin and it turns out that the cannabinoid receptors are all over the place they play a role in fat synthesis hair growth they play a role in the inflammation and they also probably have a direct role in pain and itch which is really neat so all these things come together and make us very interested in harnessing this for our patient needs what are some of the adverse effects that have been seen well in general this is a little bit broader and this it really is including things like smoking marijuana so it's it's broader than it needs to be but i figure it's better to be a bit broader than than too narrow of course it can cause sedative effects psychological issues perception and motor changes strokes cerebral blood flow differences you know dispensing decrease with chronic use and again i would expect these are really all marijuana systemic marijuana this is not going to be a cbd product on the skin conjunctival injection the red eyes of people who are smoking marijuana heart issues as well respiratory issues again if you're smoking i think that's what they're talking about here coughing wheezing bronchitis decreased lung function it even has effects on the gastro gastrointestinal system reproductive effects and then the immune it's unclear for marijuana but there are some potential adverse effects i will say that for the topical products that i'm that i'm going to mention and kind of go into uh these tend to be cbd type products they're usually not having the any of these other issues i would say that the risks there are more um it is possible that you could become allergic to it it's possible that it could actually irritate you those are the big things we don't think there's a whole bunch of systemic issues that would happen from a topical well it turns out that eczema is not the only thing could be used for and i just wanted to talk for a moment on a couple of the other things it's been looked at as a potential treatment for acne and it turns out if you look at the oil cells the cells that make our oil called sibo sites and they kind of grow them in culture they actually found that adding cbd can block some of their ability to make the fat make the oil and that's really important because we know one of the issues when people break out with acne is they tend to be doing too much sebum production too much oil production so if you could bring that down a little bit and do it safely that would be pretty neat pretty handy we actually don't really have a medicine that does that very directly the closest we have is the isotretinoin medicine that kind of shrinks the sebaceous glands but that's a little different this is more of a signaling thing as we said it also has an anti-inflammatory effect too and they did this really neat little breakdown showing all the different parts so lipostatic means making less fat or oil anti-proliferative slowing down some of the cells from growing and again we know one of the issues in acne is the clogging of the pore so if you can kind of slow that down you might slow the clog and then the anti-inflammatory piece kind of interesting and they did a study where they to control group and then they added a little bit of this chemical that stimulates oil production and they showed all the oil that's the red stuff and then they did the chemical that stimulates oil production along with some cbd and the cbd decreased the oil production so really kind of neat at least you know in a glass right so this is not really in people this isn't in a culture and it's hard to know if this would actually play out on our skin but that's how it begins it starts with noticing something and saying huh could this work in people now for the skin there's very little but there was a study looking at three percent cannabis seed extract and a base cream as a control putting it on twice a day to half the face for 12 weeks and they actually found that the oil and the redness uh were significantly decreased at various time points and there was no safety issues that they noticed and most patients tolerated it well so this is a really good example it's very small i wouldn't base major national policy on this but uh we have what we saw under the microscope in the culture and then we see in a small trial a kind of a pilot study and a half half-face study that actually really fits it well so i think this to me suggests there is real promise here now there's still a long way to go you got to get the right dosage you got to get the right purification you got to make sure it's the right vehicle and you do want to do more testing but i would say very promising that that it could have an effect on oil production and if you have oily skin this could be a way to approach that problem which is kind of neat let's get to the good stuff what about itch so those receptors those cannabinoid receptors in are actually on nerves and they may decrease excitation so if you stimulate them they could sort of cool down the sensation of itch again that'd be a win-win for us and they did a small study in 12 volunteers where they actually put histamine in their skin right the itchiest thing in the world and half of them got this cannabinoid agonist so kind of a cannabinoid that would stimulate the the receptors the other half got a placebo and they actually found that the people that had the patch with the medicine did significantly better than the placebo patch so there's again something potentially to it lots of questions but the the principles are here and that's again where all this begins pea is one of those ones we talked about early on it's it's one of the sort of pseudoendocannabinoids it's actually they call it a cognate so it improves the binding of our own endocannabinoids to the cannabinoid receptors and it's nice because it also has some moisturizing properties and seems to help with itch as well so they did 100 subjects with itchy dry skin and they either got the vehicle sort of the base cream or the the cream containing the pea and they actually unfortunately didn't find much difference so i report a negative study which is never fun but it's important again just to kind of keep balance because we often will report the exciting stuff but we kind of gloss over the ones that didn't help so in this group it didn't seem to do much and this is kind of what it looked like at varying time points so there was a trend towards improvement but but not enough to be statistically significant now in atopic dermatitis there was a large multinational study now this was not placebo-controlled though and that's important to know but almost 2500 patients with atopic dermatitis that's a little different than the last one they were just dry and itchy maybe it doesn't do as much for that what about if you have atopic dermatitis you have economy of actually inflammation so they applied the pea containing cream twice a day to the problem areas and they actually did find that it helped p was the p-value was less than .001 so significantly improved in all the following patient reported symptoms the decreased use of topical steroids yes that's a win we want to decrease the need for those improve sleep a huge win and improve dryness scratching itch and redness so amazing so this is the kind of stuff we want to see now it's not placebo controlled though so we don't know if maybe just putting on any cream would have done the same thing so again we needed to do more and better studies but again possibly interesting and this is kind of what it looked like at the study start versus the study end the dryness got better the scratching exploration got better like cannification scaling i mean everything much better but can you tell me for sure that that wasn't just due to putting on a moisturizer i can't because we know that all of these potentially could get better from a moisturizer too it would have been so nice if they had the vehicle then we would really know another study looked at oral hemp seed oil and found that it also may improve atopic dermatitis this was a randomized crossover study of 20 adults with atopic dermatitis and they compared that to an olive oil control they found that consuming two tablespoons of hemp seed oil decreased the skin dryness itchiness and use of topical medicines compared to the olive oil group and it was thought that actually in this case it probably wasn't really related to cannabinoids at all because there's very few in in the purified hemp seed oil it probably has more to do with the high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids in there so it may just be that those fats have an effect again this is a great example of why it can be confusing to try to figure out what the active piece is what's actually doing the work that being said this is something i use for a lot of patients it's very inexpensive it's very accessible there's no risk of of getting high or anything like that the hemp seed oil is is quite safe and even for kids i feel comfortable having them try some of this the only thing is it tastes terrible it kind of tastes rancid and you definitely don't want to cook with it i read something that said don't cook with it i thought oh let me try and as soon as the frying pan started getting hot oh my goodness it turned terribly ranced that it was the worst so highly recommended you just take it mix it in with something it's best in like a smoothie where you don't have to taste it at all this is what they found in the trial the hemp seed oil skin dryness at week zero versus week eight so it went down a lot skin itchiness dropping down use of medications dropping down all of those were significant other trials just summarizing everything here this is all that's been done so it's a little bit a little bit uh disheartening that after all we've talked about this is all they've done that acne one we mentioned the aesthetic eczema one which really didn't show it showed some difference but not much difference in the barrier and the atopic dermatitis one that did show an improvement and then the chronic itch one that also we talked about showed no significant differences so not too many studies have been done yet but i'm really hopeful and excited that we may see lots more coming especially in the next coming year or two we have a lot of people interested in this now finally the last thing i'll leave you with is a checklist how do we pick a good one what do we do so there's no great answer but a couple of things to think about is do we know that it meets quality standards and a couple things that can help us is if it has a current good manufacturing practices certification a cgmp from the us fta or it could have uh from the eu the australian or canadian organic certification that is associated with a higher quality because they have to jump over some hoops or the national science foundation international certification so any of these certifications can suggest that it is higher quality it's not a guarantee and there are some differences but i think it's definitely better than ones that have nothing does the program have an independent adverse event reporting program that's nice to know again it shows that they're committed it shows that they're long term they're not a fly-by-night operation and hopefully they're getting feedback and continuing to do quality control is the product certified organic or eco-farmed again while not a perfect connection with being a good one i think that's a higher correlation and finally have the products been laboratory tested by batch to confirm their stated ingredients and ideally the percentages and make sure there's no pesticides or heavy metals these are just generally good guides when we're picking supplements and the answer for some things is you can't tell or you can't get that information but it really can be quite helpful in conclusion cannabinoids have tremendous potential with very strong scientific underpinnings there's real reasons why this may help and may be useful there is some evidence for itch and atopic dermatitis and even acne there's speculation from some scientific folks from many conditions in dermatology even including some skin cancers but we have a lot of unanswered questions which one to use how to administer it should it be oral should it be a patch should it be a cream how do we do this what is the dosage what is the frequency and what are the risks for now caution is strongly advised until we know more but there is great hope on the horizon thank you so much for your attention i really appreciate thank you again dr leo for helping us get the facts about cannabis and eczema thank you to sanofi genzyme

Derbyshire says cannabis has helped her fight breast cancer without resorting to chemotherapy Linda Carson from Willington near Derby has been using cannabis oil since shortly after her diagnosis her doctors were amazed to find that her tumor has indeed shrunk by two-thirds since she started taking the oil Linda is now calling for more research on how cannabis could help fight one day maybe cure some cancers gareth own report linda Coxon takes her daily medication this is cannabis oil derived from the same plant used in the recreational drug remarkably it appears to have helped shrink the aggressive cancerous tumour in Linda's breast to 1/8 of its original size and means for now she can avoid chemotherapy I hadn't known whether it would do anything at all really because it's untried and and so on but to shrink by two-thirds in what effectively was five weeks was just amazing and it sent me into a total spin if I'm honest I've had another ultrasound scan and it did shrink by four millimeters and I've also had a CT scan which confirmed it still shrinking although the oil is made from the cannabis plant it's not hallucinogenic or addictive it's freely available in shops but health campaigners fear the stigma around cannabis could hold back research we need trials of this you know proper trials on people to see whether it works on other cancers do you think the research in this has been delayed because people reacting to that word cannabis absolutely I'm absolutely certain it has cannabis is a drug and everything we read about it it's illegal and people are frightened of it I do think that the mood music is changing because it isn't just me there are lots of people there's also scientific evidence dr. Wei Lu is researching the effect of cannabis on cancer at some George's University in London science backs up these cannabis based products as having an effect in patients with cancer especially in cancer cells so more informations required more research is needed and it's really to lay down once the thought whether or not we can use these chemicals in in patients but cannabis is a long way from being an approved treatment for cancer in a statement Cancer Research UK warned we don't advise taking cannabis outside of a clinical trial because it might interfere with other treatments there's no scientific evidence from clinical trials that cannabis or chemicals found in cannabis helped to treat breast cancer but Linda remains convinced I've started to become evangelical about it because it's being ignored and it shouldn't be she's already taken in her story to Parliament and will continue to campaign Gareth Owen ITV News", "rqIqIAKZK9w": "I just passed I'm just going through a Grants Pass

spectrum oil this is 500 milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract and a 1 ounce tincture bottle as you can see it's got a little dropper to it when the dropper is full that's about one milliliter of product and each bottle there's 30 servings we offer this in a natural flavour as well as mint on the back or instructions we shake well before using place it under your tongue for one to two minutes swish it around and then swallow the product the natural flavour is kind of like a light cooking oil texture and the mint has a slight mint flavor using essential oil that's therapeutic grade and capable of being adjusted this is your go-to day today I'll here this is your daily use morning and night middle of the day as needed you know I've even experimented with this putting a couple drops on the skin about 5 to 10 drops on the skin to just see how it would respond to some inflammation maybe a little bit of tennis elbow there this is the Honan sound it's a thousand milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract in beeswax there's a little bit of eucalyptus essential oil and a little little bit of lavender essential oil just for a little bit of scent but it's not overpowering it's not too strong it's not emasculating it's not a scent you're gonna be dragging through the room and your buddies are gonna be like what's up with this guy again this is a full spectrum help extract thousand milligrams with beeswax it's a it's a it's a hard product it's it's a solid your your body body heat will melt the product onto your fingers and you simply rub it and massage it into the skin this can be used daily or even multiple times throughout the day last but not least we have a 25 milligram soft gel for people who may not be interested in taking the tincture may not like the flavor of the natural flavor or the mint flavor we have a 25 milligram soft gel there's 30 in here that has added to it 10 milligrams of pure cumin which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties as well as anti depression properties or anti-anxiety properties this is something that I consider a nightly thing or you had a long day you want to you know you went on a long hike you got your elk hunting this is kind of like the you know right before a bad take it this made when I take this at night and I wake up I feel rejuvenated and I feel refreshed 25 milligrams is not a substantial amount of taking at once but it may be a substantial amount for you if you haven't utilized the product and I would recommend taking this at night or late in the afternoon when you're just home for the rest of the day until you see how your body responds to it I wouldn't say it causes drowsiness but it does promote and can promote relaxation and well-being so this is something you know I have to write a long day that you you're on the couch you're a back at camp take one of these and you're ready to go to bed and the properties of this product may help you get back in action in the morning you can also take up to four of these in a day but if you have the oil and the soft gels like they're good pair that go together so you can take the oil as your daily and and then take the soft gels add needed for an extra boost", "GRriQ4OysuE": "that cannabis lovers beyond the Vespa smoking the best buds and today my buddy is Daisy and for this special weed Wednesday we're talking which i think is an important subject yep so I decided to bring my favorite top school on the show and Daisy brought her Oh taco as well yeah what she made yeah yeah so for people who don't know topicals articles are cannabis infused creams lotions balms gels you know that bath salts that softens are you put it on your where you have the most pain so are this inflammation directly on that and headaches as well totally I have heard that topicals have helped with eczema yeah psoriasis and with anecdotal evidence from so many people thousands of people who can prove that this is actually a treatment that works for them and what's really cool though topicals is that you get that therapeutic cannabis relief without that cerebral hive non-intoxicating and so is generally teach seeing them yeah you know you don't get that like you'll get stone from getting its down exactly just let direct area that you put that topic along how it works is that the cannabinoids and turbines right on the surface your skin penetrates and it does bind to see bt receptors but it doesn't go into your bloodstream which i think is like what a lot of people are looking for in the middle of the day at work you know if you have a desk job yeah if you have adjust your neck kinko then in front of computer like this on it yeah just around all the time so like that it's yeah it's really lovely daisy has had lots of experience talk tool she actually has some fibromyalgia and it really does but we were talking about this earlier from and you're saying like the nine points that you get hit with and even like under the knee just left yeah so issue yeah so far grow I would say like probably eighty percent of my life is spent in some form of pain some days is really bad whatever yeah but chuckles that cannabis in general like really help with all of that right that's a great way to get some relief and I like about what topicals - thanks about I said 30 to 45 minutes to kick in Chris depending on what's in your topical as well so many different variations you can get so many different benefit like even these two are like me different like different ways of infusing the cannabis into them right so there's so many different ways that you know like maybe an olive oil is gonna get down deeper and also I know that like terpenes and stuff that are in those will actually help them penetrate deeper yeah yeah area filena you can find carry off I'll intervene and black pepper and cinnamon and terpenes really mesh well with the can her cannabinoids - entourage effect you really get that synergistic effect today I wanted to show off the one that I use I actually got this from the headquarters here in Victoria BC the ingredients in this is coconut oil peppermint spearmint leaf cloves which clothes are found in human dr. bean and that's an anti-inflammatory turkey yeah as well as the black pepper eukaryote filing that one's anti-inflammatory as well as an anti analgesic red seaweed in this wintergreen oil honey bees wax now I really like this one is every the peppermint and spearmint in it that cooling effect so if I want like a gnarly hike worked out really hard that day it's like that's exactly what you need a cold one see what other people talk opposed to is they're like you know they can be used for any purpose like we said they can be used like a casual height like the bengay or something yeah they can be used for like really serious like you know like series migraine pain yeah headaches okay you can actually just rub him directly where you're feeling pain that's where it's gonna penetrate and really I mean like I said I always have mine on me so it's like a co-worker's a thing complains but a headaches and I'm like no try some of this I do not have a deal yeah but but ya know people love it like people are always just amazed yeah people have that idea that you have to smoke or eat we to get that benefit of the pain relievers that yeah you have to kind of get that psychoactive high yeah thing is people you don't and I think that's like what a lot of people are looking for so if I personally like the psychoactive cerebral I yea recommended if you're not looking for that high but yeah tell me a bit about the one that you have here yeah all right this is from big temples actually sorry BC as well the super grade I used to work there on infection made this batch a little bit ago and yeah there's all kinds of stuff in this instead of the more typical way of infusing it we used cannabis leaf oil so it's like olive oil infused with cannabis which is cool that's got some vitamin E it's as mucolytics the eucalyptus also kind of has that cooling effect then you're gonna get peppermint and stuff like that it does have a little bit of peppermint wintergreen as well some lavender some cinnamon which as you said that and inflammatory Antion is what it's all about boom it is I think it uh when I found this out I just my mind was blown it's pretty actually I was little little terpene in it and that was like the calming more like you Florrick effect to it really strong instantly I smell cinnamon yeah the cinnamon is over that's what I smell yeah [Music] yeah and so like there is my bulletin to you but it's actually actually people at this that gives like cool that's cool I love that we brought two different ones kind of show people that there's something out there for everybody and like I said you don't gotta just get like the lotions or gels yeah bombs my friend sports the bomb around ya the bombs are really good too you know able to dry lips yeah anything like that it's kind of dry in here someone never tried any with olive oil let me try some like lotus flower it just has some lotus flower it smells so good here I'll put the lid back on but let me go on take them dude we have a lot of pain central kind of around this back of the neck area a little bit yeah awesome broken bones brains menstrual cramp oh yeah very good for mr. right is

diabetes and other chronic diseases KPIX fives done forward on the rare compound showing promising health benefits there's always been a lot of chatter about medical marijuana but one doctor here Marin says it's not about getting high it's about getting well and he thinks he's on to something yes dr. Michael Moskowitz believes he has identified a rare component of marijuana called THC V that he says is helping one of his diabetic patients a patient whose blood sugar levels varies between 50 and 1000 in a single day it's not clear but it appears on a preliminary basis for the first month that he that he did that his the the extent of how much he varied seems to be less THC v is found in this subspecies of marijuana called black beauty its leaves are much darker than most marijuana this is a single bud nearly 11 inches long and although she doesn't have diabetes Nina Murphy has chronic neck and back pain she used to treat with meds I was a little skeptical I haven't used marijuana before so it's not something that I was just gonna jump into I'm extremely pleased and I hope to be off my meds in the next couple of months dr. Moskowitz says more study needs to be done with a black beauty it's just having the opportunity to work with something that clearly has therapeutic value but figuring out how to optimize that and make that work the best for the most number of people that's very exciting the doctor travels to Miami next week speaking at a conference to discuss his findings in San Rafael Don Ford KPIX 5", "Yz-bNjWbz-0": "as more states are legalizing marijuana experts say there are some health risks people should think about 9 on your side's Tasha Davis takes a look at a new study and what it means one of the more troubling health effects to consuming marijuana is the risk of having a psychotic episode a new study published in the lancet psychiatry shows that consuming weed on a daily basis and using high potency cannabis is associated with a higher risk of psychosis doing an episode of psychosis an individual might have altered perceptions their thought processes might be different and they might lose contact with reality completely for example they might have hallucinations where they're seeing things or hearing voices or they might have false belief systems the study found those who used weed daily were three times more likely to have a psychotic episode compared with someone who never used the drug use of high potency weed every day almost doubled those odds and it gets even worse that if people who use high potency marijuana have a 5 times greater odds of having a psychotic episode the study defines high potency cannabis to have more than 10 percent THC dr. trues says one theory that connects weed in psychotic episodes is that marijuana influences dopamine in the brain a chemical that can affect hallucinations but she and a study stress that there really is no conclusive link of marijuana directly causing psychosis unfortunately marijuana has been classified as a schedule 1 substance by the federal FDA and thus hasn't been studied completely we would greatly benefit from having for the studies done so that we could completely understand what marijuana is doing to the human body and minds according to the National Alliance of mental health as many as 3 and 100 people will have an episode at some point in their lives Tasha Davis Kagan 9 on their side", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every

argument it was like some on some funny [ __ ] and i was laughing and laughing dude and i couldn't tell if it was because it was just so funny to me or if it was because of the edibles it was not funny but it was hilarious um and i didn't even realize my eyes were this low it's at six o'clock now and so it's been an hour since i took them but i'm gonna just keep updating you guys more and more and see what's up with it um i'll pick it up like around 7 30 or i just feel like [ __ ] laughing now dude but we were just in a in target for a long ass time but yeah we'll pick it up later alright guys it's currently seven o'clock and it's a cool high it's a cool like edibles don't i never really had any smack but the ones i [ __ ] tried before and this is another one i'll add it to my [ __ ] list i'll give this one a [ __ ] 9.5 just because i [ __ ] with the high it's like a cool ass chill ass high you know it's not like that [ __ ] smack smack that i was [ __ ] thinking or expecting but it's like a cool last [ __ ] high you know i got the giggles out of it i got the laughs out of it um but yeah now we're just in the [ __ ] chill eat some pizza watch some tv and just [ __ ] chill i'll see what happens at eight um and yeah i'll just update you guys along but this shit's a [ __ ] vibe it's a cool ass edible the wonka bar it's a it's a golden ticket in itself man um but i'm just being pretty good all right guys it is 10 41. um i think i last picked up the camera like that seven or eight i think i don't know when was the last time i talked on camera but it's currently 10 41 man and i just did like a fat ass nap um i think i rated the [ __ ] edibles and eight just because i don't like chocolate but the [ __ ] were fired and i sure was a dope ass high i should smack man that should be this bad um [Music] in the beginning it's like a cool ass like brush you know you get to laugh you get the giggles you're just chilling you're vibing and then once you just like start settling down you just relax dude you know you just calm down you just i think a fat ass nap dude i just [ __ ] knocked out feel good now i feel relaxed i'm calm chilling um but that edible was [ __ ] fire not even a lot i should really did smack all right guys it is currently the next day and i just wanted to pick up the camera i was just showing you editing the video and i wanted to give you guys a little bit more i wanted to give you guys a little bit more insight on to how much the [ __ ] wonka bar is smacked now that i'm sober and clear now that i can talk to you guys right and [ __ ] clear minded but yesterday i did not smoke all i had weed wise was that wonka bar and i was [ __ ] vibing and satisfied that wonka bar satisfied me throughout the whole day i did not want to smoke nor did i need a smoke i was just gone the whole day um so just to give you guys a little run down throughout the day i took the [ __ ] edibles at five o'clock and after taking the edibles we went to the store and that was like an hour and 30 minutes in and by then i was already feeling something um but it wasn't like an uncomfortable feeling i was i was vibing i was laughing it up i was just laughing it up chopping it up honestly like i just was laughing at nothing and felt like laughing at nothing um and three hours into the edible that's when i was really really feeling it in my head and i was just like [ __ ] i'm so blown and you guys seen my face at 10 41 when i picked up the camera on the last clip i was ready for bed i was so gone um i was just so blown i was ready to knock the [ __ ] out and literally that's what i did after that after picking up the camera and i hadn't slept that comfortable in it in a minute let me just tell you that edible had me out like a [ __ ] light um but i slept like a baby last night and i don't know if this is just me but me personally i don't realize how high i actually was until the next morning i obviously recognized that i'm high in the moment but the next morning i woke like this morning there was this morning this morning i woke up and i was just [ __ ] gone dude i felt so groggy and lagged um but it was nothing bad you know um i love being relaxed me personally i'm a relaxed person so it was just a good feeling for me you know i was just calm i took a fire ass shower and i was just now i'm just vibing dude um but yeah i know i gave the edible a 9.5 but that's just used to give an understanding of how [ __ ] dink it is but that was just my opinion go try it out for yourself or if you guys have tried it out already let me know down below um but literally i was satisfied with that [ __ ] wonka bar throughout the day and i hadn't had any [ __ ] edibles smack that [ __ ] hard you know that's gonna the wonka bar is on top of my list

And if you take THC\nin combination with cannabidiol actually that reduces that effect of the\ncannabis to some extent We've been quite interested in the past and looking at the effect of cannabis in Parkinson's We did a study using an extract of THC and\ncannabidiol together in a capsule form to see whether there was any benefit for\ndyskinesia and unfortunately didn't show there was any benefit at all for dyskinesia We asked patients whether they felt better in terms of other symptoms There was a suggestion actually that cannabis extract THC and cannabidiol together might be of benefit for sleep or pain and those are aspects that\nwe're hoping to explore more There are also possible neuroprotective benefits\nof cannabis - in the lab work that we've done we've looked particularly at THC and shown that it has protected nerve cells from dying in our cell\nculture model, and we're hoping to build on that in in animal models. And it seems\nto work on particular pathways which we know are important in Parkinson's - so THC\ncan rescue mitochondria (which are the engine houses of the cell) - protect them\nfrom being damaged and it also influences a pathway which is known as\nthe PGC1 Alpha Pathway which we know is important. The\nwork we've done to date has been in cell culture models. We need to replicate that\nwork in animal models of Parkinson's and so we're still a long way off from\ntrialling it's in the in the clinic but it does show potential promise Subscribe", "OZzzqz5ShNU": "welcome back to the show everybody it's 420 shorty I want to get to show you all the finished product of the staff that I did I ended up putting eucalyptus I ain't putting lavender oil and rosemary I did the eucalyptus as I bought it from a health food store and I put four tablespoons of it and I put the rosemary and lavender that I made myself and I put four tablespoons of each of that and then I put four cups of beeswax and it came out very nice perfect consistency not liquidy at all nice and smooth good texture I want to show you that the textures like of mine this is mine I keep and show you what it's like and it's very smooth and it will it soaks right in and it smells so good it's really great and it heals everything that I can even imagine from bee stings and bug bites to rashes and cuts swollen ankles crafts backaches everything everything you can even imagine I just put it on and it feels a little pretty thick and it's really great I thought I put it all over ok so that's why I keep the big kitchen pickin and before I go I wanted to get to show you all my new tattoo that I got for my birthday and it's my dragon with my bud it was originally a tip given to me by someone that I worked that I was serving back in the old days I guess it and I was a youngster and I was serving pizza back then but I turned it into a bun and I hope that she would be proud of that it's the best if I ever gone so just want to share that with you and show you how the sad one it's the perfect texture this time yeah and thank you all for watching and subscribing and give me all the comments you can and I like my videos please and let me know if there's anything you'd like to see or hear about or anything and just keep watching and thanks and have a peaceful name", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

take a tolerance break for marijuana morning news i'm brooke burgstahler ever hit those periods where you need more and more weed to feel high if you've noticed your thc tolerance has skyrocketed then you might benefit from the occasional tea break thc the psychoactive and intoxicating compound cannabis is most known for works by affecting cannabinoid type 1 or cb1 receptors in the brain over time too much thc can weaken the cb1 receptors response to thc or reduce the amount of receptors altogether both lead to you needing to ingest more thc to feel desired effects a tolerance break from cannabis is a beautiful way to restore your endocannabinoid system so that when you welcome back mary jane the effects of cannabis can return to their full psychoactive potency and while two weeks is an ideal time frame perhaps try starting off with just a day taking a breather from weed can be difficult not necessarily physically but certainly mentally for the habitual smoker your brain will

few years this is 100% legal in all 50 states and it is real in today's episode of thermal mermaid were making New England summer body butter infused with CBD and scented with cedar wood and cinnamon now for those of you who are brand new to CBD this is a chemical that's been extracted from the hemp plant and in decades past using CBD was illegal along with its cousin THC which as you know some people smoke now CBD can be consumed or it can be used topically and the products that we have here is made for topical use it's packaged specifically from soap supply companies to go into cosmetics it's not for consumption now this is what it looks like when you buy one gram of isolate powder but you can buy it already suspended in shea butter or in an oil like coconut oil if you want to now I find this way easier to measure because I can see just how much I'm putting into my formula for myself these tiny little spoons are meant to measure 0.15 gram of powder and I'm going to show you here that 10 of these heaping spoonfuls divide one gram perfectly so one spoonful it's about one tenth of a gram now it is a little easier to divide it this way because for me it's a real hassle to get my scale to measure such a small weight if you want to be more accurate you can weigh it but I find that this is always the same measurement for me now if you want to learn more about CBD or cannabis you can learn more in my book cannabis cosmetics this is available on Amazon or you can download an instant PDF copy when you become a member at thermo mermaid calm the links are listed below now this book does go into more detail about CBD and you'll get the full recipe that goes along with this demonstration along with 24 of the recipes that include hemp oil homemade soaps shampoos conditioners face masks lotions and a variety of other things so if you're into CBD as a topical treatment you may be interested in learning more now we're gonna get right into the actual body butter and demonstrate this product here are the list of ingredients that are going into this body butter shea butter you can use mango if you're allergic to Shea cocoa butter hemp oil coconut oil argan oil goat's milk arrowroot and of course our CBD crystalline powder putting this recipe together is not even slightly complicated I'm going to add all the oils into my kitchen mixer now the hard Orioles will stay hard except for the cocoa butter and typically I'll start with the shea butter and give it a little time to break down in the bowl before I start adding in the rest the mixer you see here is set on the slowest setting now once the shea butter starts to soften up I'll gradually add in the other oils and then just let the mixer do all the work even if it looks like it's not doing anything the only thing that you may need to do is loosen the shea away from the beater every few minutes but as the liquid oils melt the shea it'll start to turn into a sloppy soup as this happens just give the mixer time to get everything blended together now if you have spent any time browsing through the other recipes listed over in the members directory at thermal mermaid you may have noticed that I label some body butters winter butters and some of them summer butters but they have almost the exact same texture in the finished product well it's not the thickness that makes me classify whether a body butter is a winter or summer formula this is just by the way arbitrary it's just how I feel about it but when I do this it's based on how my skin feels after its applied now this combination of ingredients has a light slick feel that melts instantly on contact with your skin now as soon as it's applied after just a few seconds your skin feels matte and dry it doesn't leave any build-up or any waxy layer behind and this is really nice for a warm or even hot weather it won't leave your skin dewy and sweaty feeling now part of the light matte texture is in the goat's milk which is rich in caprylic acid lactic acid and also alpha hydroxy acid and of course this also eats up the dead skin cells leaving the surface of your skin feeling fresh and new so even some of these small subtle changes to your base recipe can give you a twist on how to use the product or whether it will feel like when it's finished now at this point we have our mixer running for about the last five minutes and we're just gonna let this work for another few minutes before we introduce the dry ingredients I want all of the oils to be as uniform as possible before we add the rest now if you're an avid lotion maker you'll notice I'm not adding a preservative to this particular batch and that's because what you're watching me make this is just a gift for a friend who's gonna be graduating from Wellesley this week and I'll be going up to give this to her in person so I'm not gonna be selling this now although this product does not have any water in it and it will be perfectly fine for several months without a preservative I always put a preservative in anything that goes out for retail and I recommend that so you may notice that the preservative is listed in the printable recipe over on the website but we're not adding it in right here in this demonstration and in goes the goat's milk and the arrowroot and of course you can use corn starch if you don't put in the arrowroot those two are interchangeable and as soon as this is all blended in you'll start to notice that the butter starts looking fluffier and creaming and so we'll just give these two powders a moment to do their job while we continue mixing next we'll get the CBD powder blended in now this batch that I have right here will make four jars at about sixty grams each and each package I want a hundred milligrams of powder so the entire batch is going to get four scoops in order for me to get that 400 milligrams and of course this is a gift so here's my fourth scoop and put one extra scoop in just for my friend now our fragrance that we're adding today is a beautiful combination of cedar wood and cinnamon and you can make make this a novelty item if you want to you can pull it cannabis flower fragrance oil in there and it smells just like it and what happens is is that younger people love the surprise of something scented cannabis they're picking it up at your market tables it does draw a lot of attention but in my experience my adult friends don't want to walk around smelling like cannabis and so I find that cedar wood and cinnamon it still has that edgy musk aroma and then you add the candy spice and it really is a really pretty combination but it won't get any rumors started at work so this is the one that I choose to put in once all the ingredients are incorporated I have the mixer turned on to the highest setting and now we just let it whip with air now the volume will immediately begin to expand it becomes fluffy we have these nice firm peaks and the texture of the oils start to become something like a wedding cake sugar icing and we all get the texture that we won after we let this whip for about three minutes and then we shut it all down now at this point our body butter is almost done we only have a few more steps to give it a unique look that will make it stand out from other butters with other fragrances you can get a nice close look at how fluffy and smooth the oils have become here once you have all the air whips to this texture this won't deflate it will stay fluffy like this as long as you keep your product at room temperature remember coconut oil becomes a liquid at 76 degrees and you do have coconut oil in here so you have to keep this below 70 degrees because as soon as one oil melts it all starts to separate and it might even encourage the rest of it to melt so you have to keep everything in a neutral temperature and this will stay and remain stable the two colorants that I'm using for this recipe are angry rose and so very green and this will give me a cinnamon and a hemp themed color each part only gets 1/8 of a teaspoon and this is just meant to tint the butter not color it I'm not real big on bright colors in my lotions because this is again it's it's a cosmetic grade mica which means it's also a shadow so you don't want the color to transfer on to your skin so a nice light tint will do the job okay if you caught my last episode which was a short webinar I told you that I will be giving registered members a place on my server and a website at their MoMA made to have their own e-commerce shopping cart now this is set up very similar to Etsy so you can sell your products online the only difference is you don't have any listing fees and there's actually no fee there's no charge at all it's it's perfectly free so if you're just starting out this might be a good opportunity to get into selling your recipes now the first five people have already been chosen from the comments and I'll be announcing the winners

you so make sure that you do hit the subscribe button and hit the little bell so you get the notifications so you can find out if you're a winner tomorrow and you have to be registered at with your account at thermo mermaid Calm it's four siren and mermaid level registrations now what will be what we'll be doing after I post some of these beginner tutorials to get people started with their shopping cart is we'll be discussing how to integrate your sales to the people that you meet in the real world online and if you want to follow with these conversations and watch these tutorials then make sure you're subscribed to now piping the butter into the jar is probably the most fun part of this project now you don't have to pipe this if you don't want to it might be a little bit too much effort but this is how you get that to tone to swirl into the jar now when you're doing this for real meaning if you're making a retail product just set the jar on the scale and then pipe up to sixty grams and it'll just fill the jar right to the surface and you might need to tap it down a little bit if you can but I'm over filling these so you can get a good look at how the colors blend and you can see the texture as it's being filled I'm exaggerating these Peaks a little bit just for the photos but the cream will stay in this shape and once you've put it all into the jar now remember this is not a lotion to use this you only take just a pea-sized amount and then you rub that into the surface of your skin to get a lot of coverage if you end up using too much it'll feel like you just poured a teaspoon of oil into your hand when you touch the butter and then you slide it across your skin it melts on contact so this product is very condensed if you're gonna turn this recipe into a lightweight lotion we would end up filling 12 to 16 ounce jars not just this 60 grams that we're putting into these four ounce jars so just keep that in mind when you use it but also keep that in mind when you're selling it and you're pricing it because this is a much much more expensive product than your standard lotions that you would be making so now we have our finished product and let's get one last close-up of just how fluffy and stable this frosting is now let's take a quick look at how it absorbs into my skin I'm going to take just a tiny bit and then rub this into the back of my hand and as you can see it absorbs almost instantly and it doesn't leave anything behind the hemp oil and the goat's milk leave my hand feeling conditioned but no heavy layer and here's our finished product of the New England summer body butter infused with CBD and hemp oil I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and until tomorrow happy creating [Music] [Music]", "fibAL_GxCzk": "[Music] hello I'm doctor Gloria and I am the medical director and the chief scientist here at CHR we live in sometimes pretty crazy times and it is for a healthcare provider a rather astonishing picture to live at a time where we are finally succeeding in reducing smoking in the general population we have succeeded of eliminating cigarettes from restaurants and public spaces there is such a successful effort to eliminate one of the big poisons that has plagued mankind for a very very long time and if not eliminating completely but at least significantly green reducing and yet at the same time we are suddenly legalizing and frankly out threat encouraging smoking marijuana and using marijuana in other ways there's obviously a contradiction in in those trends and these contradictions exist only too frequently in society in many issues but we need to be cognizant of that fact and as marijuana use is legalized in one more states and as it is becoming more and more available like any other product there are reports of very significant effects fertility and pregnancy the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been alarmed by increasing reports of Mariana use by women but mothers who are pregnant the effects infants are highly significant there is animal work that shows long-term effects on offspring of animals that were given marijuana during pregnancy the effects on the brain of the newborn are finally significant and yet women are using marijuana during pregnancy in in in incredible increased incidents in comparison to what has been reported before indeed many women have started using it as a as a treatment of nausea in in early pregnancy early pregnancy is the most dangerous time for effects of drugs on the fetus so nobody i think should really expose their offspring in utero to cannabis now how about infertility data infertility is more difficult to come by an obstetrical practice a lot has been published in a fertility practice the data is is is very limited and at times contradictory but we have a rule in infertility and particularly in early obstetrical stages and that is that unless a medication is really absolutely needed we really stay away from it many medications that we routinely prescribed to patients will be stopped especially in the early pregnancy sometimes to be restarted in later pregnancy but the first 12 weeks where organs are formed are a critical period and congenital malformations come mostly from effects during those earliest stages of pregnancy six seven weeks from conception and if we are willing to remove medications that we know have potential benefits and give them only under the most extreme circumstances where patients really needed and really benefit from them think about something like cannabis where we are really not sure what does it do yeah it makes you feel good but what if it really does affect your baby and what if you are pregnant for a few weeks before you know that you're pregnant while you're trying to conceive either at a fertility center or on your own and then you find out that your cannabis use has had significant negative impact don't take the risk it's really not worth it think about it you are doing so much to achieve pregnancy to have a good pregnancy and to have a normal baby don't take the risk of cannabis we really don't know at this point what the harm may be from its use in the peri conception period in schools [Music]", "RHq8w2_WLdA": "two Canadian researchers say a strain of cannabis could treat and even prevent Kovan 19 when the pandemic hit dr. Igor and Olga Kovalchuk put their efforts into looking at how cannabis could be used to fight Cova 19 they join us this morning from Lethbridge Alberta good to chat with both of you this morning morning good morning so Igor your lab was already testing cannabis I understand strains to combat cancer and inflammation where are you at in your research with kovat 19 right so in the past five years we have developed over 1,500 strains of cannabis and have tested today about 400 and we have actually found around a dozen of cultivars that were able to substantially decrease the expression of the h2 receptor took one that is required by virus to enter ourselves and out of those about two three strains can do it by 75% or more and all go so what would be the next steps here and what made you think that you should make that shift and start to think about kovat 19 well I think we all started thinking about Kovach 19 and when it hit and really disrupted our routines so a lot of scientists like ourselves decided to take a look whether or not something that we already have as Igor said we were already testing cannabis for its biological effects may be helpful so and you know luckily we ended up having some of the very promising strains so right now what's most important for us is to actually find partnerships and develop clinical trials because thus far what we shall we show in the lab and it works in the lab but we have to absolutely have to do a clinical trial to show that it really does translate into clinic that it really works in the scale of clinical trial ego you say the strains you're testing your CBD predominate why does that make a difference in getting a clinical trial up and running faster right so there are many strains that can be active but the main reason is that if you have a psychoactive ingredients like THC in Canada then the dose that you can give is limited so it's limited typically by about 25 milligram of THC day and as I mentioned our strains are predominantly CBD so they have twenty to one ratio to THC so that allows us to give up to 500 milligrams of CBD a day and still be within 25 milligram of THC so that the patients are not or do not feel impaired and it's critically important for patient and for a doctorate 12 although what could be any side effects if any well cannabis is on its own has actually very good safety profile it has been studied its components have been studied very very well separately and so the because again the strains that we are talking about are CBD dominant they have really high levels of CBD and very low levels of psychoactive compound we do not predict there's gonna be any major impairment there of course could be some things like like more positive ones let's say anti-anxiety benefits and some betterment of sleep but those would be not really sight of those actually would be quite beneficial effects that people can sleep and there may be a little bit of improvement of appetite as well so some quality of life aspects may also be improved it's absolutely fascinating we'll be watching very closely your work dr.

in CBD help the just gives my skin proper autism boost my and CBD help me finally get a good night's sleep every Wednesday this month we are investigating the 99 CBD questions you've been asking we'll be digging into the latest research and conducting our own surveys to bring you the answers that clear up your CBD confusion today we dive into one of the biggest claims that I keep hearing about can CBD help your pain investigative journalist mark Ebner Comfort was here with the results the marijuana has been prescribed for pain to the cancer lots of things actually and now CBD which is a compound of cannabis is being touted for pain as well so walk us through these claims because they're all over the place yeah there are a lot of claims that CVD is very effective in treating all kinds of pain from muscle soreness to joint pain to inflammation to all kinds of chronic pain some even take it a step further and say this can help you recover from injury faster and see meeting is described as having certain compounds that will interrupt those pain signals walk through some of these CBD products and there's a lot of opportunities here to help but these CBD products are interestingly diverse we've got ones that you ingest that start with those what's the glory so there are a wide variety of CBD products that you would take orally from tea to candy to good old-fashioned pills but there's also a wide variety of doses so it goes from as low as five milligrams to as high as thirty milligrams and this is a big gray area it's not like acetaminophen where you know exactly how much to take if you have a headache but this you are just guessing and sometimes that with the tinctures I mean they have a drop-off and your demand dramatically changing the dose there's one drop but what does that mean the whole dropper a big drop a little drop it's very confusing all right over here we've got the ones that you apply topical products yeah topical products big segment of the industry and that ranges from creams to bombs to cooling sticks they even have bath bombs that you can throw in the tub and soak in but just like with the oral products there's really a lot of variety in the doses so like the doses the prices are all over the place we have found some projects as low as $8 we found some as much as 150 bucks how can the same products range in that much of but if footballs cost 850 bucks in some cases it is very very expensive here's the thing CBD is not subject to federal regulations remember this is a supplement not a drug so the companies can really charge anything they want that can be marketing it can be hype now in some cases the price does reflect higher quality a company that's using much stricter production standards but not always well this thing's confusing me the most of them of course people want to get the lower priced item because it's more affordable yeah and they're actually often wasting their money so you wanted to test some of the products out so we had this brainstorming we decided we'll just use Mara to test it out well I have a third-party do it we got the kitty pigment right here so what kinds of aches and pains are we gonna cheat on you yeah I was happy to do it because I do have things that bother me so I have lower back pain that's been recurring for years it's from an old sports injury and my knee now has also started bothering me so with my back it's generally after I've been laying or sleeping for too long it's very tense and sometimes after certain workouts join the club I've got both of those BOCES he thought he probably does as well so where I decided to try CBD products for 3 days to see if they would help her with her pain here's her video diary I wanted to find out which CBD products would best help me with my lower back pain I decided to try three products over the course of three days a balm capsules and mouth drops day is day one and I did wake up with some soreness on my lower back which is actually pretty typical I've been laying all night and it just tends to get sore my knee is not bothering me yet that tends to get worse as the day goes on but I'm gonna get started and we'll see how cuz so it's been about an hour and I will say I was super skeptical I didn't expect it to do anything but my back really just feel better it feels really loose it just doesn't have that like tightness and that pain that it had when I woke up it's day two and today I'm trying the capsules I actually do have quite a bit of back pain today because of a workout I did yesterday so it says take one to two capsules twice a day so it's been a few hours since I took the capsules and I'm really glad that it is a weekend because I am definitely feeling a little bit loopy a little bit lightheaded just it feels like I've just had a glass of wine or two classes so I'm getting ready to go to sleep and I'm definitely still feeling a little bit out of it but I just realized I haven't thought about my pain all night state three and today I am trying the drops so these are water soluble and I'm gonna put into my shape this morning as I'm getting ready to mix this I'm realizing the dosing is a little bit of an issue the bottle says use three drops but that's not very scientific the other thing is does not smell good to see how it tastes it tastes like my normal shape so that's a good thing so it's been a few hours since I had my shake and I don't feel anything up next what Maura things worked and what didn't we're gonna explore the latest science about CBD

I'm your host as always Justin this one's gonna be a fun one hi this is this is one of those episodes that has been heavily heavily heavily requested so I think this is one that y'all are going to enjoy a whole lot today we're going to be talking with my good friend Kevin Chen he runs a very fascinating company that is engineering yeast to produce all sorts of interesting things we've talked about yeast engineering many times on the streams and in videos and generally a lot and so it's I think this is gonna be really cool to talk to someone who is doing this sort of professionally and and commercially and also just making a really interesting compound so without further ado let me introduce right your life my life okay oh there we go knocking okay cool ah I'm on TV hi everybody tonight today I introduce myself first or how do you want to yeah just start cool so yeah pleasure to be here and pleasure to a see you all I guess on this nice Saturday afternoon you know it's it's a this I guess just asked me to do this a while ago and that to think about it a bit just because like I got my own obligations with my my company and it's a some professional that I do so there'll be a bunch of stuff that I won't necessarily get into and of course you know opinions are my own when it comes to talking about a lot of the stuff that we'll get into here but yeah we're a company were called hyacinths we've been around for a while now since 2014 working on this particular pathway and doing a lot of yeast engineering we've done some really really interesting stuff with this pathway which we'll talk a little bit about but otherwise you know the whole cannabis industry has been amazing to kind of watch it grow with the past six years and watch the science of it grow and watch the companies kind of develop and being in Canada and watching belts happen it's been super interesting just coz it's like weird yeah that nationwide like legalization or regulation in progress kind of a thing do you remember daddy has been do remember getting the little little card in the mail like saying like it's officially gonna be legal soon oh really I don't know I don't wanna get in that car no oh my god I I don't know if I saved mine but I wanted to frame it yeah and that's like one I mean it's super super interesting to kind of watch all this happen and and we'll talk more about the science stuff but the whole policy around this stuff and and everything is is also huge and it's you know interesting for Canada as a country you know nationwide to kind of create this stuff and kind of force it out in some ways like a lot of people you know we're pretty reluctant about the whole topic and want things to go longer you're not go so fast or whatever else but I guess the the government at the time then he wanted to push it out and for many you know for many reasons it makes a lot of sense to legalize cannabis but anyways yeah so so pleasure to be here you know we I thought this was like a nice thing to do just cuz like it's it's an interesting and fun for me a lot of the reason why I do what I do is because like I like to talk and share and promote science and stuff my my day job as the CEO of hyacinth involves a lot of more like business development in finance related stuff unless so like technology stuff so you know if there's any deep technical questions then I probably won't be able to answer those necessarily anyways it's cuz I haven't been in the lab in a while but I do follow all the tech very closely and watch how everything develops but anyways I think I think that was kind of like you know how how I first met you Justin as well we're like we just we just people who like to do science and people who would like to share what we do and in science and and that's why it's like super fun to kind of be here and and spend a Saturday afternoon with all 411 people I can probably be more by the end of all this cool but yes I mean so so in Kevin Kevin's a very cool guy he does very cool stuff and I like so I mean especially because I'm also working on engineering yeast he has been a fantastic resource just to just to like Santa Santa D Chuck stuff and and just be like hey you know am I am I going crazy am I doing this right he's like and so you know that's been that's been really great so I've got a hyacinth page open write a link to it in the description if you want to check it out it's a really cool company they make so let's talk about the the obvious thing the you know the the stream title says THC but as THC the only thing that you guys are working on no definitely not I mean we like THC is one of a hundred different cannabinoids that exist in cannabis over hundred I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there finding more to like every every time we're like we know all the cannabinoids and they were like no wait there's a new functional group on that one yeah yeah and there's yeah it's all the time new stuff so I mean it's almost I think what we work on is a good reflection of it's maybe a reflection of like how much interest there is around different cannabinoids so you know of course we read all the papers about new ones coming out and and those ones might be you know years away from the market but it's still something that we kind of put on our radar as like hey you know we'll have some development in that maybe one way or another depending on you know how we're broke those all come together you know there's a lot of that's like we're having a bit of a yes dream for use here we can get back in good okay so before the the stream went to [ __ ] we were talking about there are you know all sorts of different cannabinoids and also lots of other things that you guys were working on so let's let's say we can pick it up up from there and I'm just gonna try and keep my eye on the the thing and see if it freezes again hopefully we're good alright so you're saying so so are you are you just mostly working on the different cannabinoids and things in that pathway or are you also looking at compounds from other organisms as well no I'd say we're pretty much set on the cannabinoid pathway other things they look at in my spare time just for fun but or business business-wise that cannabinoids are yeah I mean and that's more than enough of like industry and and market to kind of you know develop and and to work on so it's huge okay fair enough so cool I'm gonna just bring up my notes and and see what the next topic is oh okay so let's talk about the the legality of derivative products in Canada so that we know that the the plant is now legal I mean there's literally a store down the street where you could just walk in and buy stuff yeah but talking about the derivative products specifically because I remember you were you were working on this before the derivative products were legal for sale so like you know you you could still work on them from like a research perspective but I remember there was like a time when you know you were still kind of waiting for the government to catch up before the things that you're making would be sellable basically so how is how has that changed and like it do you know how does that you know affect your your business now and yeah yeah indeed block these comments I'm reading too many of them they're funny anyways so so yeah with the where we sit with respect to regulations yeah it's been dishing to kind of watch things evolve over the years the derivative products that you're talking about is is it pretty so I guess in the history of Canadian legalization first it was like hey you're allowed to use cannabis and cannabis oils for medical purposes only and under prescription stuff and then in October twenty twenty eighteen it was like okay you're allowed to now buy cannabis and stuff in a store and there's like all nine ways to buy it as well just for consumers and then that evolved recently into you like you're allowed to now sell like you know chocolates that have like you know cannabis stuff in them too and things beverages and like a more broad category of things that that contain cannabis for the work that we do you know in general where we're interested in making THC CBD and other cannabinoids as ingredients so we're not gonna grow anything that would be so Keable necessarily but we might you know do something that or it could end up in like a pill or in like a cannabis oil of some sort or canet have been like you know other consumer product areas depending on you know where we get the most amount of interest but I hope that kind of explains like water derivative product is when we're talking about that stuff it's like anything that's that's not a cannabis flower almost and and I'd be like from a consumer standpoint where we fit the most we hit best okay but I would I would have like one one slight caveat to that which is that we might not necessarily see ourselves as a company going you know having a big role in that direction it really depends on who else we work with and how we decide to go to market in different areas and you know the area where we definitely have like a huge you know edge in is in like pharmaceutical manufacturing where you have to have like really strict call a standards really strict like you know supply chain and it has to be really robust to kind of supply people who are actually like using this as medicine and that's where like of course these production versus planned production start to make a lot more a lot more sense that you're going to be from a genetically modified organism I think we're I think they might be like me again damn it some people were saying it's because of my website yeah I mean I scrolled down that okay yeah the little animation thing was was slowing it down right hold the whole website runs out these little animation things that's what I mean you might wanna okay well Celeste open this page although in a bit like now the freaking site hub thing is gonna have little animation do so alright [Music] yeah okay it's still very present well this is definitely gonna hurt the concurrence but that's okay I'm gonna just you know what I'm just gonna pull up your face [Music] yeah I mean it's kind of frozen hopefully the so it says screen froze audio okay so we're just gonna we're just gonna keep chatting and hopefully that'll eventually the video will catch up or something yeah yes the screen froze audio is okay I don't know what the deal with that [ __ ] is but well we'll figure it out okay so um speaking of so speaking of legality waiting for the streamed video to catch up but as long as the audios fine we can still talk about this so the the thing comes from a genetically modified organism so is there extra restrictions oh there is there like extra paperwork that you have to do and like testing before you're able to sell your product because of that or is it still relatively straightforward I mean it's it you know always like kind of it's it it's complicated it's so complicated and and yeah having a GMO thing doesn't nationally make it that much more complicated than there wasn't a moment I would say it you know we've we've had to go through a lot of different regulatory changes over the years and let me think I feel like when we first started out it was actually easier for us to do it this way then it was for us like you know trying grow cannabis plants and now maybe it's a bit more reversed I guess from a regulatory standpoint and in the end it kind of varies from every every country to country that you're thinking about and this is like you know I think I think in the old regulations it actually took a bigger level of permit to grow cannabis plants for research than it did for like chemical synthesis or for biological synthesis of THC website nowadays I think it's all in the same okay and almost so it's actually being a bit easier to work with plants and and as easy it is to work with like a synthesis and stuff but then so in that sense it was maybe easier over here but I guess when I talk about the game over again they get regulations that usually comes into play more when we're looking at you know manufacturing and sales and and what you're actually selling and you know where you're shipping your strains and stuff and where you're doing all the manufacturing stuff like that and then it gets a bit more hairy city life you know if you wanted to do so yeah so like if you're selling the because I guess you're not selling the the organism itself you're selling one of the products so like chemically it's the same thing there's no difference right like GM like organic sugar and not organic sugar it's just it's just [ __ ] Chuck but so like if you were selling like a genetically modified corn for example that seems like it would be more of a regulatory hurdle than if you're just selling a product from a modified yeast cuz I guess there's a lot of precedent for selling modified yeast because like insulin and all the other and a lot of other pharmaceuticals are made through modified products I mean even even like rennet is made through like genetically modified organisms so yeah I guess I guess that would be a little easier like it there is that that precedent and precedent already kind of yeah and there's even like I mean there's ways a complexity that go beyond that of course and this is where like it's it's been a it's part of what makes the job fun you know here every time you look at a new regulation it's always a bit different or every time you look at a new different country it's a bit different as far as how they weight might classify one thing another thing but you know I guess one day people will figure it out and there'll be like more clear regulations for everything but for now I guess it's a you know we're paving that road you know all right that make sense so so so moving on and I guess the one of one of the big question is when do you when do you expect to see the stuff that you're making in in stores for the first time like are you are you getting closer is it still away a while away or like you know on a scale of like one to ten ten being like it comes out tomorrow one being like in ten years like where do you where do you figure you are on that somewhere between one and ten oh great okay I mean it's it's actually it's funny it depends it turns very much on the product that we were working with and how we which market we end up going on first and of course like you know I would say there's a reasonably good chance that we'll end up having products available in like Canada before we end up in the US for example and and there is like a pretty you know clear route to market in you know that we can take and then have our products coming out here you know soon soonish and by soonish I mean like maybe within the next like 1/2 years kind of thing but I get to some extent again it depends a bit on our depends a lot of different things that might like you know get is there and also depends on which product we end up wanting to you know push that route just cuz each you know each can I mode is different and do we want to like you know have you know do we want to partner with somebody else or do you want to do this ourselves or how do we do manufacturing and it's always different as of things I sort of come together have to come together in order to make this all work so so that's the the long long answer to that question by the way as far as like you know what we're able to do now is already like quite good in terms of producing something that you could put to market so technology wise things like are really working and we're really happy with how how we being able to progress you know on that topic like so I guess the big question have you actually managed because I know there's a lot of like theoretical technical stuff of like you know this is how it could be done or you know there will be companies where you know they will kind of pretend that they've managed to do it and then get all bunch of funding and then proceeded to do nothing so like happiness so have you actually done it like do you have a yeah of course yeah yeah yeah so like you've you've got a you've got a yeast that makes that like makes the compound right yeah cool very very cool so moving moving on this let's talk about why yeast is preferred over say just growing the plants specifically like it so kind of from a couple different different avenues like why why I mean like why why yeast versus just you know a factory full of plants like what what is the the just like most obvious benefit intersect I think it I'm thinking like there's a lot of benefits but like what's the biggest one right because I mean there's been something if you if you went down this route right like what was the what was the thing that really made you think that like yes this is the the way to go yeah I mean the biggest thing I would say is just having control over you know what exactly you're making and all of the processes that are happening like in that system to to do manufacturing is the biggest thing there's other advantages in terms of like scale and efficiency and how you can of course like put yeast in a big steel tank anywhere in the world and they'll don't know how to grow it and stuff there's there's a lot of reasons why why used to make sense but I think having having the ability to turn off on and off certain genes to be able to produce one compound or another compound or to discover new ones all of those you know things are are maybe the one of the most interesting things for right now in terms of growing growing a yeast over going a cannabis plant or trying to breed and you guys plan to do something different yeah okay and also it's so I think it's one thing that's that's kind of interesting like when we think about growing the the plants like there's sort of a bit of a misconception that it's this like super green that I mean you know pardon the pun but it's this like green technology where you know all you need is just sunshine and dirt and you can just grow these things but like the reality is most cannabis is grown inside which means that it's grown primarily using grow lights which is actually really energy intensive like I was I was reading a little while ago about the energy requirements of this specifically the the use case was in Seattle and as they were they were moving towards legalization like the amount of energy that the city was consuming I almost doubled just to like power all the lights whereas if you're doing the yeast thing like there's no there's very minimal in the way of power requirements like it's put yeast in a tank you know keep it mixed at a bubbler like you're not you're not you know burning thousands and thousands and thousand of watts on just keeping the freaking lights on so there is that little bit of a misconception and also like all that power generally I mean because most places are dumb and don't have nuclear so it's not like you're if you relieve you like you know if you're running all those grow lights off a nuclear reactor then yeah sure it's very it you know it's carbon neutral but or even carbon negative but like it's that's an almost not the case like it's almost always like natural gas like generators that are powering all of this stuff so like it's very energy intensive so I guess I guess in that regard like the the East thing is kind of good because you can also rely on the like tried-and-tested technology of essentially it's making beer basically like that's like it's making beer except the the end product isn't the liquid it's the you know the stuff that settles out to the bottom like that's that's really the the difference and like we've spent a lot of yeah like a lot of like thousands of years basically making like perfecting the art of making beer so it's like there's that there's that you know president of like we know what we like we know how that works like you get a big tank and you do the thing and you know and also like you know depending on so we were we were talking briefly before we before we got started about what you're actually using to grow the yeast and so something that you'd mentioned was that right now you're using kind of like the ideal growth media but potentially in the future you can use things that are less ideal but maybe cheaper or more environmentally friendly or you know maybe like offshoots from other production of stuff so so can you tell me a little bit more about that like what are you using I mean I know you probably can't get into like super super specific the secret sauce yes yeah yeah I know you probably can't tell me the secret sauce but like it in essence it's basically sugar water yeah it's like sugar water with some nutrients yeah I mean it's it's a there's there's all kinds of different ways to grow yeast on different kinds of media and and you can have been fine control of all the different components in like your your media composition and part of that is what will give you like more or less maybe yield a product too and so it's all it becomes part of like that the game is to figure out how all these different things and do the science into the research to figure out what the best thing is and and get there I guess but yeah you're absolutely right about like you know growing cannabis being like kind of more expensive process it's not growing like the same way that a lot of other agricultural crops are growing that are that are a lot cheaper to grow of course and and as far as future goes I mean yeah we were I guess but yeah we gotta talk about this but for the sake of the audience yeah once I mean once you have a yeast that does this you know yeast can continually be engineered and optimized in different ways and that could lead to a lot of improvements when it comes to the efficiency or environmental friendliness or sustainability whatever costs of of the whole thing and yeah that's part of the you know among the many reasons why this is like an interesting technology and why why we're doing this is that you can you know actually have these futures exist whereas you can't just kind of like you know suddenly get a kind of as plan to start you know consuming a different substrate you know overnight where like you plants or plants like they kind of they're sort of set in their ways like like engineering a whole plant to do something different is I mean it's much more difficult than like tweaking a gene or two and some yeast yeah so actually speaking of that so the idea of like okay so being able to grow THC in a tank obviously has its benefits and it has its immediate scalability so so why couldn't you say because like suspension culture for example exists for for plants right where you can take a little tissue sample and then grow the plant essentially in a liquid where it sits it doesn't grow as like plant it grows as like you know tank of weird green sooo so so why couldn't you do that for cannabis for example I guess I mean I'll never say I won't say never like somebody might be a figured as I would somehow and get to work properly but generally speaking like we like to use because it grows fast it that you can replicate it quickly plant cells are you're taking them out of like the preneur mole growth environment and trying to grow them in these fermenters and then that's where like you had you have to do a lot of special things to the playa cells to make them grow that way and then is expensive like really expensive yeah I mean I'm not like a plant cell culture expert but it's you know you can look at different products that are made from plant cell culture and I think they end up being like you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a kilo gram versus like you know tens of thousands of dollars a kilogram for example or millions of dollars a kilogram kind of thing you also so I've done a little bit of plant cell culture and like the the plant media usually is composed of what's called more chic and Scoob base because biologists are [ __ ] at naming things but also it's a lot of sugar so like you still need sugar like it it's instead of just yeast where it's like you know sugar and a nitrogen source and some air basically I mean like wine like a tube a wide nutrient for example for like growing what yeast like you need like the tiniest little bit per gallon of liquid whereas for plants like you need the more chickens cook and then you need the buffer and then you still need the sucrose so like it seems like you're kind of cutting out a lot of the the middleman with the the yeast versus trying to do it with with plants yeah and I guess the other idea that's important is that when you're growing like the canvas plant grows and it produces teach seeing this trichomes and that's where the kind of accumulates you know the thing reading right student put these big flowers on the plant that that's where the product accumulates and that's like a physiological property of the plant that's like super super interesting but to get a plant cell to do that exact same like effect in the cell culture then you end up with like a much Carter situation because you know clientele culture you got like at just sugar or sells they're all like flit around there and it's not the same environment as like of course you know a cannabis flower right yeah from some of the reading of it's doing like they don't like when you grow cannabis in suspension culture it doesn't even produce THC so you'd have to engineer the thing anyway to get it to be producing the compound in an organelle like in like in an organ of the plant that it normally doesn't in cells that it normally doesn't so it's like a huge engineering challenge more expensive media and it's finicky er like if something gets in there it like it gets contaminated the whole batch is [ __ ] and then you get to start again and it's like so it really does seem like when it comes to if you're like if you really want to grow THC in a tank like yeast really does seem to kind of be the way for it although I mean then there is a the question of like why yeast right like if you just need a microorganism why yeast versus say bacteria or algae yeah so it's there's a whole interesting interesting bunch of questions that come along with that and it really depends on maybe the product that you're making and that's where like I can I could argue that for some products plant cell culture makes perfect sense to manufacture the thing but it really depends on the the product and the cost of it and the complexity of the the actual pathway and everything like that but this is also like you know part of the reasons why you can choose you can choose which organism you want to do in in many ways yeast is great because it's easy to engineer it grows fast you has a lot of different kind of metabolic parts you can play with and and you don't see as much of that in like other kinds of bacteria or in in algae or whatever else you know you have to you might have to fight harder to get it to like take up different genes you might have to fight harder to get some of the genes to actually make function properly in different cell types and or you might have to like do more engineering with the metabolism to get it to like you know do the right thing that you wanted to do right there's more questions beyond this but like yeah growth growth rate and how they react to different products being made and how well it makes different ya can get into this like fun and complicated science of yeah metabolic engineering and I mean I think there was something important that you mentioned in there where it's like you know basically like yes you could express the genes in sort of whatever organism you want but it's not enough to just have the genes there like there's like all pathways require feedstock so if you can't also mess with the genes that control the feedstock you might like have great expression of the the couple of genes you want in like e.coli but if they don't have the ability to produce enough feedstock it kind of becomes a moot point where like you're just you're just not gonna get a very good yield even if you can express the genes just fine like like e.coli are very easy to get genes into but if they're missing the the like basement and metabolism to get you the the stuff that you need for them to even work like your yield is gonna suck yeah yeah and that's like I mean so many that's where it gets to be like yeah pretty complicated interesting science I mean it's why it it's part of the fun of the scientific job I guess and you can you can have a whole two hour session just on that or something like that right so there's there's been a couple of questions asking about the pathway so we'll get into actually talking about the pathway in a little bit I just wait I've got like a list of questions that I'm just kind of working my way through so once we've kind of talked about all the the background we'll talk a little bit about the pathway closer to the end because I mean it is a very interesting pathway there's some like really really interesting chemistry in there that I'm excited to talk about and also I'm gonna be showing there were some comments about the side link like I've you you provided a paper that from a different group that is doing this and and you know one potential pathway that they're using and because I think one thing that it'll be important to talk about later is that you know there's there's there's many ways to skin a cat right like you can you can get to the same end product chemically through very different rats like their might and and you know one route that might be easier to engineer might not necessarily have the best yield and and that kind of thing so we'll talk about that a little bit later so let's just kind of keeping to the the you know talking about the the industry and the like kind of business aspects of this cuz I mean really like at the at the end of the day the only thing that makes any of this work is the fact that like you've got the you know money and backing to do two thing so where do you see the the industry going like this I mean this is a very new interesting take on the the thing that the industry I mean in in Canada within the first like weeks of them opening the industry up made millions and millions and millions of dollars so like where do you where do you see the the industry going now that things are becoming more legal and and more products are available and all this kind of stuff well yeah for starters all the products gonna be made by yeast one day there won't be any kind of this production going on anymore very soon people will still want to go cannabis in the future someday but a there's I think that I mean the industry as a whole where do I start so one of the interesting ways to think about the industry is you know looking at the alcohol industry you are the tobacco industry and see how those have gone or are going and see where cannabis like could head eventually and you can draw all these like interesting cultural comparisons between like all these different things that exist I mean as a whole it's like a lot of interesting questions that like you know everyone has to ask for themselves culturally and also black politicians have to figure out like how do they see this unfolding and and how do you see you know legalization existing or continuing just kissed or do you see it going or not and what else you know it's it's I think one of the cooler and more interesting ideas about this stuff is that you know it's this industry that's coming from this very like taboo black market into like this legalized market and if you think about like you know the way these compounds actually work and and how beneficial they are or how not beneficial they are for different you know cases and compare that to like you know alcohol for example then you know you could argue that the the health impact of alcohol is a lot worse than the health impact of like you know cannabis related stuff or those compounds that are there that are interesting well I mean like alcohol kills literally millions of people per year whereas I think cannabis is killed zero yeah I think that that's like and also like the only the only reason that like cannabis was illegal in the first place was racism Oh like like yeah back I mean was it was it Nixon I remember but the whole the whole war on drugs started as a way to basically shut down like government dissent because they knew they had nothing on the protesters so they're like well if we can just make there right so it's been it's been really you've been watching at one of the Netflix the 13th cuz that the documentary where they they really I haven't seen owe us that ones no I haven't seen okay you talked about about this stuff which is secret it's actually super cool but I recommend watching it you're gonna happen but but yeah you're right you're right it's this interesting set of laws I can devote which didn't necessarily have a solid basis of like reasoning why or it's just like general you know fear of stuff that people wanted it to go one way or another right yeah I mean I remember back in it what like while I was in university just having like casual conversations with people who were like really against cannabis like they're just like no it's evil and we shouldn't enema like I wish but at the time I didn't know that the whole reason it was illegal was because of racism so like I I'd had that like a little bit of tidbit to be like so so oh you don't like it why well you know it's illegal yes but why was it illegal like well cuz it's bad for you know cuz of racism so you know that's yeah I mean personally I'm and this is totally just my opinion I think the war on drugs is really [ __ ] stupid like just it's dumb like it's it's it exists basically as a way to funnel people into prison and then use them as slave labor like it's really [ __ ] for and it doesn't hurt anybody like like someone smoking some pot is not gonna hurt anybody like there's definitely a conversation to be had of like it's not the like magical cure-all that people pretend that it is and like it definitely has health effects like it can totally [ __ ] your lungs up and that kind of thing but it's also not the like evil boogeyman that that it's it's often made out to be especially by what's the best way to put this older you know politicians in the 70s or something like that right 70s it's still all right like like earlier yeah like politicians still think like love to demonize it as this awful like horrifying thing when it's like it's just a [ __ ] it's just a plant chill and it's cool I mean the cool thing is like how many people maybe are being convinced now of the opposite and the way that this is all being reconsidered where it's like you know you can actually ask the question like how dangerous is this really and and actually have you know science back up some of these things and that's part of you know the cool cool things that are happens in this industry and and now that is even being like you know the the leading edge of these kinds of thinkers are starting to do stuff like oh we can do like clinical trials with like MDMA or without science and treat PTSD and start to push things in that direction too which is really really cool because you can you know it started to see these new medicines that are being considered which whereas in history they would not have been considered at all because it was in the legal taboo around them and seeing this like yeah nice way of stuff in cannabis and even more like newer waves coming in like other areas too which is which is exciting too yeah and I mean as and I mean on that topic like there's other plant or well organism derivatives because I wouldn't I mean a fungus is not a plant but like you know there's all this fantastic research on how like psychedelics can be you used for like like really serious benefit for people with depression and all this other stuff and obviously like I I always like to you know put the little asterisk on that one where people get a little bit too excited about this and then less that becomes their only thing it's like okay like you you still probably could use some antidepressants but the fungi are good too but or you look at the opioid the opioid crisis has a can either case example where like that's something that was you know pushed legitimately by like industry and then turned out to be like the worst thing ever right like you can put them in prison for us yeah yeah it's really crazy right so it's this funny so it's nice to kind of see these stories come out and be be open and be like popping the stories and people can kind of like a look at those and say like oh yeah we did that wrong very obviously and and now we can think differently about things which is nice also there have been some really interesting research on in areas where they've made cannabis legal like the use of opioids goes down because you know people have other methods of I mean because it's not magic like it doesn't just like make pain go away perfectly like that's it's not how biology works but I mean when it does make it better and more tolerable and so like there isn't necessarily as much of that like need for like narcotics so you know that's that's been really interesting and I'm and I'm excited to see kind of how that continues to develop especially I mean especially in Canada where we were essentially becoming this like really fascinating use case although I do find it also very funny when like so in Quebec for example like they tried to make it illegal to grow the plants yourself like you could only get it from and you know they always make the same stupid justifications like we need to protect the children what if the children get into the plants I'm like well then you're with the fight then you can make first of all what child goes around just like chewing on the plants like if your kid does that you have bigger problems because it like if they're doing that with like a cannabis plant oh they're gonna have real exciting time when they tried that with anything that's outside they're going to die yeah but you know so for people who are not familiar with this the federal government set it so that each individual province could set how many plants you're allowed to grow and Quebec being [ __ ] Quebec decided to be dicks about this and decided to set that your the the number at zero but this was struck down by the Quebec Supreme Court where they're basically attempting to make something illegal which the federal government has explicitly said is legal so because they've tried to be dicks when the law got like undone and it got set to the federal maximum so instead of just like being you know kind of conservative about it'd be like you can have one plant they tried to be dicks and now it's four so like I just I find that deeply entertaining like because I mean the the people who are in and I mean this is getting into all the politics and chick which is not particularly interesting but the people who are in charge in Quebec are you know they're they're very you know that you know they're they've got that like old-school stance of like all drugs are bad and and also they're fairly racist but that's another problem for another day but yeah so that's that's been very interesting and it also it like you know they'll make the excuse of like we're trying to protect the children when in reality it's like no they just want to have a monopoly on the sales it's most of what it is but anyway so that's that's that so let's let's move on from the the kind of like politics and vitriol because as entertaining as I find it it's it's probably not super interesting to listen to it yeah you know different guests different Channel just for that yeah right I could have all sorts of people just to like you know [ __ ] on the government that's it's my favorite thing to do moving on so so actually well speaking of the government are you preparing for the eventual legalization in the US and are there are there other countries that you're also lying because I know there's like in like the Netherlands like there's some amount of it's it's some somewhat legal like so are you looking at other markets outside of Canada or like you know what's you know what's it what's your take on that yeah short answer is yes definitely looking at at its South out of Canada and and that's one of the nice things about the East system is that there are many vacuums so inside of Canada that you can leverage to do this very quickly it really like everyone Dreier like everybody well I guess we'll talk to me we'll get any more into that later and then why is different a bit but are there either wait that does the air side there is many packing facilities that you just like around the world that do this kind of stuff with with yeast and the production so yeah a lot of different uh versus we go a lot of different regulatory considerations for each different country and definitely yeah I don't know what will happen in the u.s. like we'll see how that goes I think I haven't heard too much recently about who's the next one pushing for like cannabis related legalization and stuff but there's been a lot of activity there and of course now I think the majority of states have at least some like you know legal access to cannabis and maybe that's the way that'll go will just be that all the states legalize and then eventually a federal you know government has to make a decision but it's all yeah interesting exciting stuff to see see who will do what and there's even some like finer differences between like whether you're looking at like THC at the product or as like CBD is the product and then whether you're going like hemp or whether you're going like cannabis and then it's also gets a bit funny but yeah a lot of a lot of interesting lot of doors that are that are opening very cool very very cool I mean I personally I look very forward to seeing it it all get legalized in the States just because it's I mean kind of getting back into politics it's like it's just funny watching the like old stupid politicians being like there's Brad whereas like I think it's it's the like a significant majority of Americans are like no this is fine the [ __ ] you talking about like so you know that's that's been very interesting okay so let's get into some of the the more technical aspects of this and you know fingers crossed that as soon as I tap off of Skype that the stream doesn't just [ __ ] the bed but okay let's let's start with the the simplest cuz it was something that you sort of just mentioned um when it comes to actually growing the yeast like what does that look like like so I mean it's it's some flavor of bioreactor I assume but like what what does that look like is it a big steel tank is it you know smaller little reactors like how is it is and like do you is it gonna be grown in like a large batch that you then harvest or is it something that you're kind of constantly pulling off you know small amounts of the yeast and media like howhow are you looking at that like what's the because i mean like you said it like you said that it's not like growing beer so growing beer you do it is as big batches so I guess you're doing kind of constant systems no not necessarily and that that's something I'll defer to like you know we it's it's pasta development it's like a workflow that you try to figure out like what's the best way to make something and and maybe it is by doing a batch maybe it's by doing a continuous like extraction process there are different ways to to go about it and and it's a lot of stuff that you know might become like trade secret stuff will become patentable stuff one day someone get too much into exactly what we're what we're doing but it is fundamentally different than like growing a beer yeast where you're trying to get it to produce like you know ethanol and and you have like these you know maybe somewhat similar kinds of feedstocks that are always being used there so you know I wouldn't say we could I would say like our manufacturing will look a lot more like insulin manufacturing right where it's like a big steel tank very sterile conditions very controlled environments very controlled like media and all this other stuff and and less like a like a beer fermentation and that's like a yeah and the students we really want to go that way but I don't think I don't consult I'm just just really quickly we just had a donation from mon stead he says I couldn't afford 420 like 420 and for four dollars and twenty cents seemed a little bit too low so he donated $42 so thank you very much Mon stead greatly appreciate it so so getting back on do it I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna see if I can pull up some images of what an insulin bioreactor looks like I am very sorry if this bricks the scream and if it does we're gonna we'll switch back to the Skype view so bear with me if this if there's bricks but assuming that it doesn't then it'll actually let us look at some more images you know not not that also I just noticed that you've got a Spira card thing in background yeah which [ __ ] yeah shout-out to to Elliott Spira and Elliott both - very cool [ __ ] we talked about him on the last stream actually so okay let's let's pull some stuff up so this is the so this is the the paper that you linked to me and it says the complete so the name of the paper for those who want to follow along is called the complete biosynthesis of cannabinoids and their unnatural analogues in East so I mean it's exactly what it sounds like it's using yeast to make cannabinoids and included is a wonderful little biosynthetic pathway and it might I mean it's definitely complicated like it's not a you know one enzyme and then it just happens kind of thing like there's a lot of different enzymes in here I mean you can even see that on the you know some of the unlike one one side there's like one two three four five six one eight like there's like nine different enzymes just to get to like one of the initial feedstocks so like it it definitely has its its quirks but I mean the main thing here is basically it's it you get two two different products so GPP and oay and we'll talk about those second I'm just trying to keep out of the corner mud and see if the stream is lagging and it doesn't seem to be so I think we're I think we're good okay so obviously the route that your company is going down is potentially different than this like we said earlier there's lots of ways to skin a cat so which it's a very weird expression but I think about it but don't don't skin your cats leave them as they're cuter that way but you know so this isn't necessarily the pathway that you're going for but it's one example pathway so to me the things that they really stand out here are first off GP p so GP p is actually something that we've talked about in many streams before because it is sort of it's it's one of like two compounds that basically act as the the feedstock for most are not most but many many different metabolites so I've got a window pulled up over here so this is hopefully not gonna break the streaming empty but so for example I'm just gonna I'm gonna move your your floating head here so GP p is geranyl pyrophosphate basically the way that like yeast and plants and and this sort of thing will go about making compounds is very different than the way like we would do this in like a flask in a chemistry lab right so just just the thing that I've got pulled up here I'm starting with this one initial compound like you can make literally hundreds of different compounds depending on which enzymes act on it so the fact that THC is made from GPP is actually I find fascinating because it like I said it's it's something that is you know extremely ubiquitous in in biology um so in this case it's GPP inouye and so the Oh a is a little bit tonic but I'll live tall olive italic acid [ __ ] biology it's hard to browse thanks but so again this is another really interesting example of there is absolutely no reason that we would ever do this this way at a flask but like in a biological system it makes a lot of sense so you can see that it's this really weird long poly key tide this being that the ketone unit polyketide that gets cyclized into the the aromatic group so in this case you've got one long weird compound that ends up with you know aromatic on one end and a dangly hydrophobic bit on the other end and then when you combine these two so like once you've got GPP inouye like a suit is just off the top of your head do you know if away is present in yeast normally or is that something you've got to add so Oh way is not present in this normally yeah definitely at that that's that's the first first recombinant step I guess okay so that makes sense because I know GBP definitely is so okay cool so you'd have to so I guess that the orange is probably stuff that is already in the yeast whereas blue is stuff you have to add and you can see that it all starts from acetyl co a like it's it and or like hexanoic acid these are both like fairly basic simple things we actually looked at hexanol in stream very recently I think was the last week week before so you know all but just to be able to get to this end product because you need this thing you've got to make this whole pathway work which I mean that's a lot of enzymes potentially so I mean I'd like you'd like we said like obviously you can't comment on the exact way that you're going about it but like already just just to get the process going this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 enzymes just to get this first feedstock here like that's a lot of engineering just to get to this point so it's I I'm I just want to convey like how potentially difficult the thing that you guys are doing is like there's a lot of work that's got to go into making these things work and function and just just to make the end product and so I mean it seems like a fairly simple step once you get to this point like you've got your GPP you've got your Oh a and it just looks like it's too in like two enzymes basically just to get to either THC or CBD and this is this is also kind of cool like you can start with these same two feedstocks and just changing one gene dictates what your end product is which so I think that kind of leads into or harkens back to something that you mentioned earlier where you know changing one or two genes lets you tweak the the end product and so you can get these two very different very valuable products using only a small amount of modification like once you've got the like initial stuff set up which I find that very cool and I mean by the by the looks of this this is these are both the THC or CBD a and you can see that it I'm gonna make this little bigger so this is obvious you can see that there's a little T here this is not an enzyme this is just Heat okay good old-fashioned heat so yeah there's just just kind of interesting into it which to me I find this interesting because that's the exact same thing that happens in the plant like when you like it's if somebody is like smoking the plant for example that's where that heat is coming from so it's like the the it becomes the active form when you heat it not necessarily in advance so I just find that interesting so I guess actually that's I mean that that raises an interesting point are you gonna have is one step in your process like say you decide to make your product into a pill or you get is is you gonna have to like roast it at some point like is like to do that that conversion like is there gonna be a like a cooking step and like do you do you expect that to mess with your yield a little bit like cuz I mean as soon as you're heating something like you're definitely gonna destroy it a little bit so like is that something that you're you're already kind of trying to account for yeah it's part of the process overall I'd say and something that also needs to be looked at yeah you're gonna have to deal with that one way or another okay no I think there's something else that we've got going on that's like mainly gonna like you know kind of find an interesting way to cut around that but I won't get into that but basically yeah I mean when people make like cannabis oils for example like you you're extracting from the cannabis plant and then you're ending up with like you know a THC a in this like oil or whatever and then you you have to heat that to to get it to be like decarboxylated and then you actually have the active ingredient in the oil because normally you normally use smoked cannabis right that's where I get me carboxylated but like I'm making an edible like it gets decarboxylated I mean a lot of people will do it before they even start the cooking process but a lot of the time it just happens in the cooking process so it's like at some point you got to put that that energy in there to like knock the blonde off yeah yeah I guess so and there's a lot of actually interesting things beyond that when it comes to like using just see th CA and CB da in their original forms as like more like therapeutic products but you know usually when people talk about these compounds are talking about THC and CBD as being the ones that are the active you know things that that people really want to use that will have like kind of an impact right but you might even go to find more things beyond that so actually speaking of this light so and I mean of course you're you're free not to answer if this is but is there a like because I mean THC and CBD are they like really famous cannabinoids but is there another cannabinoid that you find particularly interesting like something that you're thinking of maybe pursuing one day or has interesting properties like are there any that stand out is basically what I'm asking let me think there there are many best and it would actually maybe I'll think for a second and then come up with something that ferno's maybe more specific but let's see I mean one of the if gonna look at something interesting that's what we're talking about is like a recent publication with a compound called THC they gave it a name which is a bit silly but THC P I guess which most everybody things cuz you never know what's gonna come up yeah hopefully you'll get this paper which is which is talks about this compound just a slightly different variation on th see that that apparently had some kind of like higher affinity for like the receptors which doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be like better or worse than then THC originally was its but it was like kind of a funny headline to see that come out and then like be like oh that might be like an interesting thing and and then but in reality if you know you're gonna file chemistry you'll be like oh cool that's nice to see that they've proven that and like cell lines and stuff maybe you got on transit to humans then it could be an interesting target but do we actually need a stronger form of THC like maybe not really okay with the regular form of THC that's right that's really interesting kinda like they're like it's it does the same thing it's just stronger like yeah and actually if you want to get into like the history of this whole like industry and it's the the perspective of like you know compounds that are stronger or weaker or whatever it's all said this is you is this found in the plant like as far as this synthetic as this found in the plant so you could I think this is one that the recent so we've seen minor camino it discoveries so like you could breed the I mean this would be a shitload of work but like in theory you could you could breed plants for this cuz I know that like the actual biochemistry of the plant itself like you kid there's a there is a hard threshold of like how much THC you can actually get in the plant before it just dots so like I think it's about 24 or 25 percent it just it plant gets real sad at that point like it does it doesn't like it yeah so I guess that that that raises a really interesting possibility of if you could breed this stuff and select for this rather than the traditional THC you could get more potency in the same amount of like gram for gram worth of stuff and and kind of surpass that strength threshold which sounds kind of [ __ ] like 25 percent cannabis is already very strong thank you you'd have to be like have a heroic tolerance to be able to even like deal with that casually without it just knocking you on your ass for a week but you know hyperbole obviously but like it's that's a really acting concept as as people like especially now that it's legal and people are able to study this more that it'll open up these like new discoveries of like hey you know maybe we've been selecting for this the wrong cannabinoid all these years maybe there's you know maybe there's something better so that's that's really interesting and I think it's yeah I mean it's like one difference of bond-like it's a trans instead of a syst bond or something like that's that's yeah wild you could get into actually I had two things to say on that one is that it's it's a fun thought experiment think about like why why wasn't this compound not already selected for in the book history historical of like you know use of cannabis like people say like oh yeah you know kind of busy be so much weaker like years ago and then people selected for it now you have like these high THC strains or whatever but why why wasn't why it was THC P not the high you know high THC strain or whatever and I guess I'd ties back to like you know some fun name is a evolutionary geneticist watching and who can dig into this and sugar and seven or something like that but I guess like Brussels sprouts like how Brussels sprouts used to suck and then people kind of went back through all the old heirloom varieties and found ones that were not gross and so like those became suddenly this is why like there's been this weird Renaissance and Brussels sprouts so I almost wonder if that would happen with this compound like if people start going back through the old like weaker strains finding one that's much higher THC P content and then just like using that as a new breed stock like that could be fascinating maybe but this is a this is my other point there's a there's a big big asterisk there which is which is that you don't you don't want to mess with this system almost in that and that in that in that way and if you look at the history of of the endocannabinoid system I guess and you can you can google around like all the the drugs that came up for the system and basically long story short there was a compound that people try to develop which is for when you've lost them for obesity and it did hit like the same receptors that THC hits and hit them pretty hard and it's kind of like optimized for that almost like it's one ease designer you know when when you look at the the structural biology of it and you designs things right and what ended up happening is that that drug got to mark it and then got recalled and eventually cut out I think altogether just cuz it was one of the big side effects was like really hard depression suicidal thoughts okay so you can look at the story it's the park is called Ramona bunt and think it was Sanofi that that was the one working on it and I don't get into the too much of the complications of how big firmer works but basically yeah you don't you know they want to have this compound exist and and have it you know be the main driver this industry because you might start to see those kinds of things and that also gets into the argument of like you know the term like synthetic cannabinoids which are like you know chemically synthesized compounds that are hitting the same receptors but they're not TV and also you need enough coming from plants and just these new compounds and that's where like yeah you have these stories of like I think it was the bath salts stuff that was a huge controversial in these new black market drugs that are coming out and causing all these problems so I mean THC is good because of the history of it like there's literally thousands of years of safety data in the sense that like people have been using it for thousands and thousands of years whereas all this new stuff you don't have that like historical precedent so yeah maybe THC P is way stronger but like like you say it could have horrifying side effects that maybe that's not what you want necessarily so that's that's really a thing that but I mean you could say yeah but I I look forward to those clinical trials like yes like but this is also the most fascinating so interesting things about this the endocannabinoid system thing right it's like this this system of receptors that you know does it seems like it has its hand in a lot of different things related to like human development related to like psychosis and all this other stuff obviously but there's there's it's still people are still trying to piece together these different receptors and how they all work together and whatever else it's not like a super simple system and for example like CBD people like CBD doesn't hit these two yeah you're looking at I guess looking at the live stream but I know this is like a few seconds behind so I'm like I don't know where we're at now see you on CB t receptors if you look at those receptors in like what hits them that's not like it's not like if you hit the cb1 and cb2 receptors harder you're gonna get more or higher or whatever you might just have like you know worse things happen is sometimes it breaks yeah yeah and then that then you had like these yeah stories that people using cannabis for things and so it's like this weird all those like weird backwards stuff happening with this this plant and what people are using it for and how that might one day become like mapped out from like a receptor standpoint but for now you know it's still a lot of science that's being done a lot of figuring out like how each compound works with which parts of the you know I like the biology and humans that it's hitting and it's one of the big challenges and I think if it was a simpler system than like you might not even have a as much attention towards this this stuff but because it would be solved to kind of cook the meeting but anyways right I mean it's fascinating I yeah and I mean this is this also like that that really does touch on the like I mean so I took a like a pharmacology like pharmacokinetics course at one point also just we've had a couple of donations that are like 4/20 themed so we just somebody donated four hundred and twenty rubles that was so thank you but you know so it and it was it was really interesting that like you know there's a few main like targets for for drugs generally but it's these tiny little changes can be like the difference between something working really really well and also having a horrible side effects and especially like when you get into the like generic versus like the original thing like sometimes they'll just like stick a functional group on a on a compound and technically it is equivalent and so you know they can there's basically like these these weird examples where if you stick specific functional groups on things like you can just barely shift it enough that it's not patent-protected anymore and you know because it's so similar you have their amount of clinical trial that you need to get it approved is way lower but because you've added this functional group there is the chance that like it might have been really important and then like it can have wildly different effects and so like that can be really really tricky and that's why some people will have [Music] like you know really unpleasant side effects when they switch from like the the name brand to a generic so that's really interesting I'm sorry that we just had a question it says all trips down is this more cool than economical so what do you think is this is this more cool than economical I don't I don't think so I think it's I think it's well you know I mean it's not really cool any cool pretty cool but I also think like it's very economic like my drawings also very very cool like Hank of THC and like swimming around in it sounds entertaining but like also it sounds very valuable yeah I mean I mean very quickly it starts to get a yeah sometimes my depends on my my days like sometimes it feels more cool but but it is still very very cool we got her yeah like I mean the number of days that I've been working on the spider silk thing and I just want to like light everything on fire just you know switch to gardening well I think it's a thing it happens but no okay cool so I mean that's no sort of what I expected like no but one thing just to quickly come back I'll correct you on this that the generic generic versions of a pharmaceutical product are supposed to be identical like factually identical I think what you're talking about is something called biosimilars where it is like a slightly different modification and gets around these like patents and then you end up with like maybe different different effects and but I don't want people to start buying brand-name drugs and that's really changing the economy but that direction is not like a good thing necessarily for like the the main compound isn't necessarily the difference like some sometimes in a generic like the the main compound is the same but they might have added a different like filler or something that [ __ ] with the exact behavior of the hill in the person not that not but I mean that's not to say that a generic is worse than a brand name I mean it is I mean I'm like I'm on a generic and it works just fine but there definitely have been cases of just I mean it's it's biology as soon as you [ __ ] with one thing like somebody's system is gonna respond to it differently so yeah and I guess there's a there's another interesting area of like experimentation that's just around like hey like can we take like yeah again I used to keep these apples DTC is available in like as a pill you can get like THC pills under prescription and so it's a product that exists it's usually used for helping people with appetite and symptom management when they're going through chemotherapy you can also get something that's called Sativex which is a product from a company called GW Pharmaceuticals and that's like a it's actually a cannabis extract that's I think CBD and THC together also available under prescription for the similar kinds of situations and then just recently there's a newer one that came out which is actually a liquid form of of THC essentially which is just like I guess it again it'll get absorbed differently it'll it'll maybe react a bit differently but it's you know all variations on the same same sort of thing and maybe in the end this is better for consumers because you just have like all these nice options that you can choose from and if you if you can't swallow pills and great and take a liquid option right and also I mean either with like speaking of THC specifically like I know lots of people who are totally fine to smoke it but as soon as you put it into an edible they're like nope I'm I'm done like they'll they'll have like you know heart palpitations or whatever whatever the case may be like wildly different effects even though it's exactly the same compound like that that delivery mechanism really can radically change just the way your system responds to things and I find that fascinating I mean it's it's totally not necessarily fun to experience it firsthand but but from like a detached scientist perspective like no this is fascinating apparently if you deliver through one organ it goes this and you know that kind of thing so like that's a find that fascinating totally yeah and this I mean the crazy thing about the cannabis industry specifically when you think about that stuff is that you have so much experimentation already happening when it comes to like you know the different edibles different oils different ways people are dosing themselves at the stuff like both illegally and and legally I guess and that's that's what I mean where things start to yeah it's a little bit backwards where you have a lot of first-hand experience that's coming back and being put into like the pharmaceutical industry maybe and then people developing products like has a reaction almost but yeah I mean like especially because it was illegal first like yeah and and that whole the whole culture of it developed whilst it was illegal and now they're trying to like you know back propagate that essentially like I mean I remember when like concentrates were first becoming a thing and I mean cuz like hashish has been around forever but like the the like the butane extractions and now the the co2 extractions and all this kind of stuff like we have lots of data on what happens when you interact with the plant but we don't have a whole lot of data what of what happens when you're like literally just taking in the pure thing so you know that's that's been very interesting that now there I mean know that it's legal they can actually study this [ __ ] properly which really is what they've needed to do the whole time and like I still think it was done that was illegal the first place but like it's I I hope that now especially now that they're looking at other things like MDMA ketamine all those kinds of things and looking at them for pharmaceutical or like from a pharmaceutical standpoint like I think it's I think people are kind of learning their lesson from cannabis and that like you really do need to like get as much studies done as you can but because I mean inevitably it's gonna be applied to millions and millions and millions of people so you know getting getting as much of that info in advance before you have to find [ __ ] out the hard way is definitely definitely valuable so I think that's yeah yeah so like everybody's learning a bit from how this is uh this whole industry is developing and you know what and this is like why legalization is also such a complicated thing we're like yeah sure it's a you know statistically or whatever else economically you can think of all different reasons but also like you know the hope and dream was that you legalize cannabis nobody gets hurt right but then in reality maybe some people do get hurt and then you have to you know deal with that I guess and I don't know I'm not an epidemiologist or like a policy analyst or whatever else so I kind of can talk about these things and not feel like I'm trimmers are supposed to do anybody I guess yeah and I mean that's the rest the responsible thing like I mean there's there's nothing worse than somebody pretending they're an expert and then being wrong yeah or like I mean there's actually funny if you everything so it's it's all it's all super cool it's all really interesting biochemistry if you want to like you know think another funny thing about you know cannabis legalization stuff I think one of the points that I remember being a the age at which you're allowed to start buying cannabis in Canada was one of the ones that maybe was the gay bigger conflicting point when people had more flexibility on how they wanted to do that and that was like very much a on one hand I think the science was saying like not until you're 25 or like there's like a task force out coming together with within Canada it kind of said like yeah we should set the age here but then the federal government decided that actually should be kind of either 18 or 19 and then of course Quebec I think is 18 and then other provinces are 19 it depends on how they how they match it I mean Quebec is trying to push into the 19 actually I think they wanted to put out like 21 like they really wanted to push it back yeah and actually legitimately that could be the right thing to do of course and that's that's why I like the task force recommended to 25 or whatever something higher and then but I think that might have been I think one of the main arguments against that was that actually you know a lot of the use cases of illegal cannabis end up being that age smaller age range anyway you kind of want to be able to address that with like the legal market and then it becomes an economic decision rather than like a health care one but and also like if you try and restrict it to 25 then you end up with the exact same problems that you have with alcohol or cigarettes or any of the other things it's like yes technically it's illegal but if it's available people are still gonna get it regardless and like I mean it was and that's the thing it was illegal for a very long time and it's not like people in who are like 15 or 16 have any real trouble getting it like it's a thing so you know that's I suspect that they probably took that into account as well like it's like from a science standpoint like yes you should avoid it until at least 25 so because then it can sit as you know interactions brain development and all this other stuff but then from like an economic standpoint and also just a legal standpoint and a like functional standpoint like how do you actually keep it out of people's hands and like because if you make it illegal and people are just gonna get it anyway like now you're just running right like headfirst right back into the same problems you had when it was legal where now you're gonna criminalize people for having it when you know like it's a kind of a personal responsibility thing and also like they're gonna do it anyway so like I think it's one of those like yes you can put out the recommendations of like but you really shouldn't but people are going to anyway like it's yeah yep so it's super interesting super complicated but a part of what it boils down to and this is I mean it's a nice thing to say cuz we have like a big audience here I guess I can say like hey you know when it comes to using this kind of stuff or anything in general in life just like try to be healthy you know you know like you've got you'd be probably everybody has friends or heard of different kinds of people and how they use even like the more psychedelic drugs and you can hear people using those things like really responsibly and having like you know experiences that make sense but of course if you don't do that responsibility responsibly then you're gonna have problems or they're obvious like you know situations that you really want to stay away from like you know you could you could easily argue that you know maybe actually I don't think stupidly like I would say actually a good thing the point that I can point to is like difference between like the culture around maybe alcohol and in different countries yeah where in the u.s. it's a lot higher drinking age in Canada it's a bit lower and in Europe it's even lower and then you have to think about you know which nation that has the most sensible policy and it might be more of a cultural thing where like the people in you know grow up with the right kinds of education and the right kinds of like understanding culturally of how to use alcohol safely or or how to enjoy it I rather than like abused it obviously and the same thing to some extent applies to the the Canada some use a whole and I think that was one of the you know dreading dreaded things about people you know legalization happening is like how many people are going to end up abusing this reason it's the wrong way and having a really bad you know effect and then and then they have to repeal everything which is you're fortunate things happen like that all sorts of problems also sorry not not to cut you off we just had a really big donation so I just need to say a huge thank you to Jack for you we've we've actually just hit our fundraising goal so that's super cool so on the on the next stream we'll be starting the next one thank you so much greatly appreciated I'm glad you enjoy the channel okay so it's back to the back to the discussion at hand sorry I was really exciting I've been so I don't I don't know if you I mean you can see it in the thing the donation goals are I've finally decided that I need a new editing computer because I've been using the same laptop for like five years and it makes very angry noises when I'm editing it doesn't like it so I'm building myself a like a proper tower so just I'm like doing I'm just doing the fundraising like piecemeal cuz you know I want to get good components and I want to make sure that I don't have to do this again for hopefully five or six years yeah you know doing that is greatly appreciated all the people who've been donating by the way super awesome so yeah very very cool so I'm just I'm gonna have just a quick peek into the end of the comments cuz I mean I think we've we'd actually gone through my whole list of stuff that I liked you know we've pre-prepared I don't I don't actually yeah I think we I think we've basically covered all that so I'm gonna just go through the comments and see if there have been any interesting and and also guys if you if you have comments or questions that you want to ask Kevin now is the time so yeah this so let's let's see what we go [Music] this is as soon as you do that like the like comments flood in faster so like as I'm trying to like read one it just the thing keeps moving on its own and [Music] [Music] I mean it's been a lot of like bickering I'm not actually seeing any any good questions yet hey come on like you know now is your opportunity opportunity of a lifetime asked asked the the magical east man some questions I you know I the thing is I saw some some earlier so I'm kind of like scroll up to it to see if I can find them I mean there's there's definitely been some some questions about like you know could other drugs be made this way and I mean the answer is is sort of a resounding yes but it also depends like you can't make LSD just because that's a weird like weird chemistry it just doesn't work but you can make psilocybin and there's been some very interesting papers we were talking about this a little bit before we got the the stream started where there you could totally make psilocybin with yeast you can you can take the genes out of the fungus and express them in yeast and works just fine but you know then it gets into the difficulty of the engineering process and a lot of that stuff oh actually there was one thing it was so you know you're you're selling or you're looking to sell the derivative products so the actual like oil itself but have you considered just sourdough well because I mean then the yeast is dead like you're no one's gonna be you know stealing your intellectual property if you're selling it it's like toast but but is that something that you've considered like or is it I think there's I think there's a some some of the articles that we get featured and had like a picture of bread and then has a quiche or the marijuana leaves on there something like that until I kind of it's just as like a header for like a article or something anyways yeah thought about this I think you don't end up with enough yeast in your dough or in your bread in the end that it actually be interesting in any in any way that's sorry what about like Marmite I mean barbecue grubs but it would do the J like it's not to say that like you know we'd concentrate is any better like yeah I mean if that's something you're looking at like rather than going through that like whole much more difficult process of like purifying the compound like would it be potentially easier to just like make some weird THC Vegemite technically yeah it might be easier to produce a yeast that way but I think you know coming back to like the different processes to use things I don't think you might get enough actually do you think for a second anyway the triceps we thought about this a bit and and but I think it starts to not work actually it starts to break down when it comes to like maybe which yeast is actually used for these different things and like you know do we actually want to try and you know will that Marmite that we might make with our yeast still tastes as good as the Marmite that because I mean because you play so much with the metabolism of the East and the types of yeast that you're using then you might actually end up in this spot where like it really doesn't make any sense to try and do that and and it might be even like fundamentally impossible to like have the metabolisms work you know in such a way that you do end up with both scenario as possible actually and and this is why also like you can't just throw this into like a beer fermenter and get the same amount of product out you but you need some maybe some fire control or different kind of conditions that are gonna really turn up those yields okay so here's an interesting question I've been seeing some questions on like a like a biosecurity standpoint like are you worried about the yeast ever getting out like how are you gonna be controlling to make sure that like nobody accidentally because like if somebody else got a sample of your yeast like they could totally make some but like do you have I mean obviously you're not gonna have to comment on like the specific what are the security features of your warehouse and yes yeah is this something I mean I assume this is something that you you take fairly seriously and this is something that is is on your mind so it is it is something that is on our minds definitely thought about before you know if it were to get out then I think there's it's just get more technically difficult to grow this kind of yeast and that's where I would be like less worried if somebody on the street like happen to get it you there's different this room I could argue different reasons like why it's like make sense or not in the end we're just very careful with how we handle westerns at least and I'm just not gonna let it happen okay but I mean that's that we're only one of a bunch of companies working on this stuff so maybe eventually there will be somebody who does who does get the Jews released and I think I think that's it's a common question in like biosecurity in general is like how does this work and what happens here or there and and maybe hmm I mean have you heard of the the case of the the phage theft but I think we might have talked about this at some point in you know months ago but so there's this with and obviously this is not a one-to-one comparison with yeast because they don't they're not a virus they don't just get on everything but there's this really famous example of there was a lab that was working on a phage that killed a particular type of bacteria and another lab wanted it and you know had sent them an email be like hey would you set share and they're like no so they sent them a physical letter like I'd like an actual like written like please can we have a sample of your phage and so because it was a written letter they had to respond with a written lit written letter so somebody from the lab that had the phage wrote them a letter and was like no sorry we can't give you a phage and then the the lab that wanted it took the letter like sterile e blended it and just plated it and got the phage because there was a little bit like just from the being in the lab like it was just all neatly present and they managed to isolate it off of the piece of paper so like it's a file right like is so is that something that you might be concerned about like are like that may be someone in your production plant might get some on them and like you know so it was like hey man I'll pay you 10 bucks if I could swab your face or whatever like is because I mean that that seems like it could be terrifying from from like a security point of view so yes I guess you but but then again it's also with the yeast so let's someone's like sticking their hand in the VAT like this isn't really like a problem and you wouldn't do that anyway because it's got to be super sterile and all this kind of stuff so yeah yeah basically yes yeah you know it's not it's not so easy to just like get it and then grow it and then you're off to the races you know there's if you are really really smart biotechnologists that maybe you could try and like do something bad but I think we we just it's just part of being a company and having really good security protocols for handling all this stuff and getting gun situations and through it properly so it's not like something we haven't thought of or something that we're like you know particularly susceptible to and yeah you can almost you can also imagine it sort of like the same case where like like Humira or whatever is like this 11 billion dollar revenue drug or something like that imagine if somebody stole the strain that produces Humira and tried to produce that you know on their own probably the company that makes you mad will find out and then also sue the [ __ ] and then you get into trouble yeah but also you might you might have just have like a much does not grow the way that it grows the when we wrote it and then then you end up it's like just it doesn't snot feasible to actually like get a strain that way I mean and I guess like they'd have to be intimately familiar with your process because I assume it's on some weird selection agent with weird media and all this kinda [ __ ] so like unless it was like an ex-employee who like stole a sample and do the recipe and like we're getting into like Willy Wonka territory it's like I will pay you $10,000 for a never-ending Gobstopper kind of thing like yeah the park is like that isn't it yeah right exactly yeah well we all know what happened to the guy in dress the park right yeah I mean the thing is might have not actually seen Jurassic Park so oh really uh which I feel very stupid because like I'm I for all the [ __ ] that I do I really should but I I think it was one of those like it was the best way to put this I have a very low suspension of disbelief threshold and that one does in like it's like the concept doesn't work so like I it's it's hard for me to enjoy it because I'm like that's not that's not that's not how that works that's not how a anything works also like the like then there's the and this this has nothing to do with anything but like the the dinosaurs do not look like that like all of the which admittedly was an older it like especially the original one was an older movie so like some of the newer research where like most dinosaurs had feathers like hadn't been found yet but I just I wish they'd had a big feathery t-rex that would have been so much more fun like so yeah that's that's the thing but I know I'm gonna take a lot of [ __ ] for not saying Jurassic Park so now I'm gonna have to go from now I'm gonna have to go watch it but yeah anyway okay so let's let's see what other what other questions we've got I saw it because I saw a couple interesting ones goodbye I mean there's so there was also a couple of questions from the like offhand and you can't make LSD thing and the reason is that it like LSD is not a biological part like the the precursor is so either like the ergot derivatives or LSA or all these other things like those things can be made bio synthetically they are made by lots of different organisms it's it's that last step where you like take the precursor and actually like chemically transform it into LSD that you can't do by I mean as far as I know I could be wrong maybe somebody's made some weird freaky enzyme thing that does it but like as far as I know there's no enzyme that does that that last switcheroo so you make the precursors be like I mean you could totally make a yeast that makes her got her got amine or LSA it's just the the that is that last step that you just can't do [Music] [Music] oh so so what a question why yeast over algae because algae is also something that's that's typically thought of as you know being grown is the in these huge facts so is there any particular reason why you would go for for yeast over algae like what are their like are there any specifics uh yeah I mean we talked about a bit about earlier but it's kind of depends very much on like process metrics and also like the science going into like how you actually can engineer that organism so for example like the yeast metabolism is fundamentally different from like a holiday metabolism and you could argue that the yeast metabolism is more suited to producing these particular compounds because it has look you know that active you know this was precursors that are need to go into this pathway for example I assume you could get an algae to do this stuff which again there's differences in how you how a yeast will react with like you know being recombinant and having DNA in it versus how in algae would and that's where like this is pretty reliable the so after you've engineered the algae let's say then you can think about how you're gonna grow that and how you're gonna separate out your end product and you know if you think about algae you're more likely thinking about like white and co2 getting into to make it grow faster or better or whatever and that's where like you start to hit some hard like physical limitations you can't get more more light into an algae tank like you can't add more sugar and add more water and that's like even really fast and get it to high density cultures that are really efficient but the algae situation can be more complicated and then you could get it argument like oh but you can grow algae off of sugar too and then right I'll leave it at that like yeah it's processed yeah it is the process in the end and you know yeast is a pretty familiar process and very efficient process and a very vigorous process and then algae you may be like West less so okay I mean I and that makes sense also from from what I know like just the actual engineering of algae is more difficult like it's there I mean they're just kind of they're picky organisms and there just hasn't been like yeast has been extremely well studied because it's used for pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff like there's literally textbooks on all these different kinds of yeast strains on how to and how to engineer them and how to work with them and how to grow them whereas algae like we're good at growing it but actually like messing with its genetics is hard and just things don't don't necessarily cooperate so oh so have you looked at all at terpenes because you you know you've got the the THC have you have you thought about growing the you know the the flavor to go with it or is or are you more focused on the actual like pharmaceutically active compounds definitely more on the the active compounds there although some of the terpenes are starting to let me show some promise of in terms of being actual pharmaceuticals - okay but it that also like those are different pathways that are going to be different you know it could be made more easily by chemistry or extracted from another natural source and then it becomes there's already a process that exists for some of these ones as well like I think women even is it maybe is one of these ones that like limiting this kind of becomes by its industrial chemical it's also forget it yeah yeah we have lemons there's yeah so you know you don't need a yeast that can produce eliminating maybe where you could argue that and work at the economic I have that does that actually okay I got the only reason I haven't tried it is because there's no I think it uses uracil dropout media as the selection or like dropout media with with Europe no yeah it's you're still drop of media so it's it's missing uracil and I just don't have that like I don't I don't have drop up media so it's the only reason I've tried it because like oh my oh my yeast engineering tends to be using gee for Nate just because it's easy and g418 is cheap and drop OBD is expensive and annoying although actually so I bought some tryptophan dropout media I didn't even I didn't even want it I wanted the I came as a I got it as a kit from Carolina they sell the their bio builder kits one of them is a keratin yeast kit and I just wanted it I thought the kit came with this is actually really frustrating that so the kit was supposed to come with pre-engineered keratin producing yeast and that was the only thing of the kid I wanted they don't sell it separately you have to buy it as the kit so i bought the kit and the one thing that was missing that they forgot to pack was the pre-engineered yeast I was so annoyed but it came with a bottle of tryptophan dropout media so I'm like alright well now if I've got anything so I found a plasmid that that's Curie recombinants and the keratin plasmid that I currently have has loxp sites next to every single gene so if I take my pre-engineered yeast that I've already managed to make and I'm you know throw in the the creep plasmid which is on tryptophan selection I can now use that media to make like an integrated version of the thing and then I should actually get like really weird like color differences because depending on which one of the genes is running and in what quantity like you'll get different colors like if the if the keratin synthase stops working but the lycopene synthase is still working you get a red colony whereas if you've got both they look orange whereas if you know you get really low lycopene and really high kara didn't looks yellow so it's all this kind of stuff so that was just something that happened recently but like all so it's it's a very interesting thing of like you know when you've got all in like when you're trying to make a product that requires more than one enzyme like it's very interesting to see the dynamics between them so like especially with something like THC where you've got anywhere from four to eight to ten enzymes that you all need running at the same time like your your yield can vary wildly just in in small changes in the expression and like tweaking the individual enzyme so I think that's what the fascinating if you want to violations an interesting one I think that's another one of these a proof of concept kind of pathways that people like to play with because it makes a purple color and if you if you mess it up and it makes black instead then you play with the enzymes a bit yeah cool and so I'm not really gonna get into like talking about the specifics of Endre enzyme engineering but I suspect that you have had to do a little bit of that like the natural enzymes maybe aren't as active necessarily especially in yeast right like they're the plant enzymes for a lot of them so I assume you've had to do some work and I mean you don't need to go into the specifics but like what what does that process been like like how how do you go about that like what how do you decide like this is the enzyme that we're gonna mess with like you know do you is it done rationally or is it done randomly like do you just kind of like start messing with aminos and seeing like which ones like which end up with an enzyme that works better or is it something that like you find in research and you just try and replicate that so it's it's more like the I guess rational and and irrational approaches on I'm doing is I'm engineering stuff I would say like you know we have done is build like a really efficient way of going about doing that and that we're pretty pretty happy with I would say like our like our genome engineering or and the hydrating platform is really nice the and that's like that's what I get that's all I could save we're good but yeah I mean that's the that's the it's it's an interesting topic to kind of get into like different techniques events and some engineering that you can look at and and how I think if there's any good publications on this clear pathway in general or if anybody's really dug deep into that but anyways yeah getting a bit more technical there but yeah enzyme engineering is fun we do it do it pretty well okay yeah so and and I mean you can you can not answer if this is you know something that you shouldn't talk about but do you spend more or equal time messing with the enzymes in the pathway or have you also started looking at messing with the metabolism of the yeast generally and I this is definitely something we've touched on a little bit but like is like like is it a lot like do you really have to go in and seriously tweak the metabolism or do you more focus on just trying to make the enzymes themselves in in the pathway you care about better it's it's a bit of both and and a lot of like maybe crossover between the different teams that are working on this stuff I suppose yeah what should I say about this so actually I mean that do you have different teams in your company that like focus on the different aspects so like you know one group or some okay so you've got like a metabolism engineering group an enzyme engineering group that kind of thing and then presumably like process engineers and that sort of thing yeah yeah total okay cool how many people do you yeah how many people do you have working at your your company now like because I mean I know when it started there was like three or four you but like it's it's grown quite a bit yeah we were at about over 20 people leading into the month of March and then business is where I stood shut down and stuff and then we've made some like changes to our team since then I guess but that's uh yeah okay so but about about 30 people yeah actually that that brings up an interesting question how has the the the ye old plague affected your ability to do the thing like is it as it like interfere do the research has it interfered with production like how are you how are you handling that because this is I mean your your business is very different than like your average retail business but like it's got to have been affected so like how how has that been handled it's uh it's been okay actually I would say like so so I just thinking about something else for a second we it's been hard because like we're yeah we're kind of a smaller company that's funded from like investors and stuff like that and so a lot of like the support and a lot of like the the way the government was like funding things like you know sporting stuff wouldn't leave applied to us right away in the end you know we we we deal with money in the bank to kind of like lead through the stuff and still make some like really interesting achievements over the course of the past past few months but so I would say you know some hard stuff to deal with being a CEO at this time is like a pretty challenging kind of stressful thing anyway anyone yeah anyone be anyone beating companies through this this period is like under a lot of pressure but but as a whole I would say like we've handled things like reasonably well and and we're doing okay okay fair so actually I think this this actually leads into another interesting question you know let's let's fast forward a few years let's say you're already at at the point of scale and production and you know you've got a product on the market how differently would your company hold up in the case of you know a plague event or serious [ __ ] happening compared to like a more traditional farm like would you have an easier or more difficult time easier okay I would say I mean if you depending on them yeah hypothetical plague in the future like what the next one yeah how's it gonna transfer but I guess you if you think about like you know managing a production plant that does like he's manufacturing versus having to like you know trim cannabis flowers like there's there's interactions at that like you know you don't never have to touch the east if you're ever if you're doing this kind of manufacturing ever when it comes to doing doing this at large scales and so in that sense yeah any also doing you know need to as many staff to kind of run it like a big facility like that compared to you know the number of staff that need to like watch over the plants and make sure that they're all growing the right height and everything like that right so they I can think of all these different reasons why it might make more sense to in the future how's it become more automated right like I mean if you're if you're just processing yeast it's just liquid handling basically like yeah and so that's like right right I mean it's you're handling liquids and goo whereas if it's a if it's a traditional farm like someone has to harvest all the plants someone has to trim all the plants someone has to package all the plants and so it's also more hands-on especially in a the age of hey maybe you don't want to be touching things so you know maybe like at the end of your process it can be mostly automated and you just get like a 55-gallon drum worth of concentrate at the end versus when it's plants you still might get a 55-gallon drum and concentrate but there's a lot more people involved potentially right so that about sum that up yeah basically okay I mean one day we'll have robots that will farm all of our plants too and they maybe it doesn't matter anymore although yeah but farming robots are hard firming a robot very difficult and they're it's very expensive and I mean when you compare the the difficulty of a liquid handling robot on an industrial scale versus you know some robot that has to want like understand and interpret the shape of the plant as its trimming it and harvesting it and working that you know getting it's it's you know hokey bets up and up in the plants space like that is a much more difficult engineering challenge and and like even just computer science chomps like how do you teach a plant what a plant teach a [ __ ] teacher a robot what a plant is supposed to look like and all this kind of stuff and then you know properly interpret all the signals so that it handles it properly and have you know whatever grabby arm thing that you know it's it's a it's a more difficult challenge and it's more expensive and it's probably more parts whereas with your stuff because it's all just liquids like it's just you know turning valves and [ __ ] on and off they tank us up yeah yeah drains fast right like drain every drain into the ground we're being you to go right you know have that tank get hot that that tank is cold you know you know spin that one's a centrifuge that one's solvent you know whatever the case may be yeah that's very interesting so it's theoretically more robust so I think that's also an interesting prospect for both I mean other pharmaceuticals but also just whatever other end products and and cannabinoids and other things they end up making like it adds a layer of robustness in this in the face of the world shutting down which yeah and this is this is the heavy hitters of this in bio hype circle are all in favor of this kind of thing right we're like going good yeah grow yeast in space and then you can do it that way too right and then you have to that's just anything you want uses very true right plants do you look forward to one day sending some stuff up to the space station see if you can t need like a little like petite like you know you know they like the rackmount units they've got on the ISS you know it's like and this is our stove or oh yeah yeah you know do you imagine just having like an itty-bitty one and just like astronauts vaping in space like maybe nothing Esperanza vaping in space or something I don't know what the relevance of bad to you okay I wonder if there might be something there too if you ever wait six months you know in the void of space going to Mars yeah yeah that's something to do yeah somebody is somebody's butt actually bone bone development and degeneration maybe there's something related to the endocannabinoid system there so you might actually have a a therapeutic use okay but for science I like it no no it's your safety babe I mean maybe maybe the astronauts whether you want the video do they do they want this kind of thing up there do they even I don't know what it's like to anyways well cuz I mean they get like weird issues like co2 pockets so it's like if you'd end up like if you if you like hot box your corridor as quarters it just might just hang there okay that's so have you I mean this has really nothing to do with anything but like have you thought about the like the physics of growing pharmaceuticals in space cuz like you're like you know it's fine what it's a tank of liquid on earth like you've got gravity to hold your [ __ ] in place but like I feel like that would be a huge engineering challenge to make that work in in space like things would would slosh around and just float in weird like you'd have to like get the tube into like at the center of the liquid somehow it just did like I don't know it's just I think geometrically it would just be a very interesting a very interesting challenge to like deal with the fact that your liquids don't sink yeah I haven't I haven't really thought about it actually yeah yeah I mean that's fair although although there was I came pretty close to actually this it was a competition that that was gonna be related to some like getting our yeast strains into space as like a research experiment somehow anyway that was like a years ago that I'd tried to do this thing but there there is some interesting stuff when it comes to microgravity and yeast and other microbes and how they grow when else other stuff and I guess there's work to be done and interesting things that I guess all organisms kind of change whether you end up in that environment you know humans I mean it's a trash it also the radiation environment too so you'd have like this is something I've been thinking about like if you try and grow your pharmaceuticals in space like it's a heavier radiation environment you have a mutation it's gonna [ __ ] with your product so bad like it could like it could wreck your batch really really easily I mean there's been a lot of experiments where they try and grow bacteria in space and they get angry like they do not like it why they just they Butte ate really hard and have really nasty products are being produced and it's just it's very strange it's entertaining yeah it from like a from a science perspective it's fascinating but like I would not want to be the guy in charge of that oh man I have they done slime mold in space I feel like they did but also if they haven't they need to because that would be such an interest in your experiment yeah I wonder I haven't I haven't looked into it what else yeah space is weird space is weird stuff it's very weird I like the idea but I'll get there eventually but like yeah yeah I guess you gotta figure out I think so I still frozen at her waist I think moon is probably where a lot of this stuff is gonna end up happening uh yeah anyway cuz I mean that's that's like sorry like [ __ ] Mars thank you the the moon is where it's at and like I'm like I think Mars bases are stupid but I'm a huge fan of moon bases just because it's close and it's it's just a very fascinating thing but I I think you know I mean also there's enough gravity that like your liquids would still probably slosh around in really weird ways but there is still enough gravity that like a tank of liquid will settle and so like I think being able to grow pharmaceuticals in the way that you are will probably be very valuable technology on the moon I almost wonder if that's like because I know there's grants and stuff for for moon project I almost wonder if that's something that would be worth like you considering like if I need a grant all that means I'd be entertaining just like she very fun but III think like long-term like being able to because the only time like that sort of base would really be stable and viable long-term is when you can produce all your own stuff and like pharmaceuticals I think is gonna be one of the most difficult to produce because you know each pharmaceutical has its own quirks but I think you know if you had like a hundred tanks each one produced you had a yeast that produce some different useful thing like that seems like a really viable way of overcoming that problem in this because just cuz it'd be like technically easier than trying to do chemistry interface like well there was there was that I think it was craig Venter that was the one that kind of suggested like oh why don't you put like a DNA synthesis robot on the moon that just like spits out DNA and then you don't even have to have a yeast collection of these various type of DNA being synthesized in here yeah the presumably although that works [Laughter] I guess you could imagine that giving a a you know basic yeast strain and then you transfer me with different pieces of DNA and then depending on what you give it and then it'll it'll make a different public right and then you have to have a right in theory that sounds good but as someone who's actually done like a lot of you know toiled away at yeast transformations like it's not that easy it sounds really good on paper in practice you know but this is this is later in the future when we have a synthetic version of yeast and that actually takes a teenager yeah we yes sure first that and then make that you strain now can can I have it please I want magic yeast that makes my life easy [ __ ] I mean it like forget growing THC that would be way more valuable just magic east yeah make anything that'd be fun okay so let's let's see if there's if there's any other questions but and we've been going for two hours so like if you want to if you're ready to wrap it up we can do that let's just let's just see if there's any other interesting the question was really quick I'm just gonna like skim through so yeah you know it's if anybody's got like a you know a pressing question you know speak now or forever hold your peace we have you a minute or two just cuz I know there's lag on the stream so yeah if you've got some questions leave them in the comments and we will try and dress them but otherwise it's been fun I'm glad we finally I'm glad we finally did this this is things has been a really interesting conversation we got to cover some really interesting ground it seems people have been enjoying it so that's been good yeah I think it was I think there's a pretty significant lag on the stream so it's gonna take them a second to actually start sending some questions if they do that otherwise they're probably just gonna continue bickering amongst themselves as usually goes [Music] okay so there was one question on the stability and reproducibility versus like a cannabis monoculture it's like how's that comparable I mean I don't know that much about cannabis monoculture I would say but like I think like for yeast it's no problem that's easy you do it all the time like it's it's just part of the game for cannabis I think there's a more specific things that you have to do in order to get it - yeah grow consistently and to do that like you know for I guess you think you might be think about like 20 years that you're using this like it's same exact plant in the same exact way to make the same exact compounds for somebody to use for therapeutic whatever and that's I think you know some companies that are doing more the pharmaceutical aspect of this stuff are like you're working towards that or have spent a lot of time like mastering that one aspect of it like for in cannabis consistently and then but that was like I think that's a big challenge earlier on in Canada's industry and still is hard to get like you know uniformity across like every cannabis plant that you grow just about different different conditions that might tweak it a little bit I mean that makes sense Oh will you be doing an IP out like at some point are you looking at taking the company public are you gonna stay private for the foreseeable future yeah good question we'll see who's fair good yeah well when you do that is the question oh yeah yeah of course right a lot of I mean that's like the the whole sort of story right like what do you end up in future and it's like you know hopefully you you find a way to to keep to make the company exist and actually take it like in tests huge a successful thing and then you can decide if you want to sell it or if you want to be doing they don't want to take it public or whatever else right right yeah that's possible fair enough and this I I assume this is something that you'll only be able to be like yes or no but do you do computational analysis to predict the structure of better and more efficient enzymes I think when we talked on that we talked about this a little bit but like short answer is yes yeah but I guess generally speaking you know I did that did this work in my undergrad about like how to use computers to predict stuff with enzymes and it gets to be pretty I like despite many years of computational enzyme discovery in prediction and design whatever else I'll say that the results from computational predictions are like pretty limited yeah so so you know even the best people in the world at this science technology of like particularly protein structures are still still having a hard time with a lot of different cases right I mean that's that's sort of what I expected like do anyways yeah it's a cool topic I love it I love the topic of computation with that prediction that's super cool it is super cool it's just also enzymes are hard yeah and and all the things that we think will work don't often so like a lot of the time it's it's you know you know I've got this great idea and what if we just tweaked is one thing and or you but then you just like mutated randomly change something that makes no obvious sense to you and it just ends up working way better than like okay what right so it's like okay cool there's been a lot of questions like do you are there are there internship possibilities of your company and also like just asking about your hiring practices like are they mostly like PhD and master's student like or people with PhDs masters all sort of thing or do you have kind of more of a like a open range more more open range actually I think we've we've got like a good mix of things and and we don't necessarily you know I mean we have some philosophy where it's like we don't necessary want to hire a PhD to fill like an entry-level role of course that's gonna be more like a bachelor's or master's student that will fill those kinds of roles so you know every rule has its place and person has its place that accompany so I mean yeah that's fair enough but so you're more looking for like talent and skill set rather than like magical piece of paper I say it generally yes yeah I know that's where I'm all about it that's that's good [ __ ] okay that questions already been answered like a hundred times [Music] no okay I've not seen anything particularly interesting so I think we'll probably wrap it up there well either way thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun I know we were we've been trying to set this up for a little while so I'm glad we finally finally got it done it seems like people really enjoyed it and I mean I think we got to cover some really interesting ground I mean I learned some things this was this was really great so yeah thanks for thanks for hanging out cool yeah this is this as fun as a pleasure hopefully people learned something from this exchange here otherwise people if people have questions is there a spot that they can contact you or and do you have any other I mean there's the the hyacinth link in the description but is there anything else that you want to plug while you have the opportunity good question I don't think so I think just follow that link if you want to hang out with other people who like to do DIY bio stuff and and you can go check out Rico bio I guess that's pretty good bio and we'll I think the websites out of date now but he'll updated maybe and then even the future when people watch this they'll realize like oh yeah this is cool otherwise yeah nobody can send questions to you and I'll answer them through you maybe is it also another approach to that fair enough is there is there a contact page run on Python or is it there is but we're usually pretty slow to answer that just cuz like okay that's that's totally fair alright well thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun for the the regular viewers and the next stream should be on Monday I think we're just", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "ATDB4zmZKlE": "CBD cannabis oil has attracted a lot of THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage drug interactions and the effectiveness of over-the-counter CBD [Music]", "_knJDER3PkE": "True or false. CBD is the same as marijuana. [Rachel} That's Correct.\nIt's false, Yes. Cannabis is the genus of a plant it's the category of plant. Under cannabis you have marijuana and hemp plants. Okay? The difference, they look the same by the way they smell the same. Right. But the difference between these two plants is the amount of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol now this is the active ingredient in marijuana that's what is the psychoactive ingredient. But you typically know when you think of marijuana you think that people are getting high that's the psychoactive ingredient. The difference is that if a plant has 0.3% or less by dry weight, it is considered to be hemp plant. Correct. If it has more than 0.3% by dry weight it is considered to be marijuana. So that's, right away, the definition. CBD is a cannabinoid. There are lots of cannabinoids that have a lot of active properties in our body. Our body produces endo-cannabinoids which are naturally occurring. Here on the screen you see two different things. To the left is THC. These have the same number of atoms. The same type of atoms, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But, the reason why we highlighted this structure is different. And this is what makes the big difference between THC which is psychoactive and CBD, which is not psychoactive. When the chemical binds to the receptor that structural difference will make something happen different in the body. Right. So that is the difference between THC and CBD. And CBD. Very important, okay? CBD, if it is taken exclusively solely from the hemp plant, it is legal. It is allowed in all 50 states. However, if the CBD is taken from the marijuana plant or it's partially taken from the marijuana plant it depends on the state. As to whether or not they allow it to be legal. As to whether or not it's legal, right. CBD comes in all types of products. When you go to the store, you're gonna see it in all different ways. And I want to kind of guide you through how to choose what you want. Here are some examples of things that you might find. And there are more than this, by the way. But this is a bath powder. So people put these into their bath they dissolve it into their bath.\nI've actually never seen it in bath powder. But I think that that makes sense.\nYeah. Because people soak to relieve pain and inflammation as well.\n100% Right. So it gets into your skin and it give you that soft tissue relief that you're looking for. Lots of lotions out there. So you go to a lot of these beauty stores and cosmetic stores, they have it in the lotions or some of the pharmacies.\nI use a balm. It's like a very thick.\nRight. Dense balm. That's right, so it's thick sometimes, like a salve or it's like a nice thin lotions so they're all different types depending on what you want to get out of it. There are capsules that you can take. Yup. Then you mentioned earlier for Isabu they're tinctures. You have the little dropper and it tells you how much to take and you put on your tongue, boom that's it. And then, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. A pain rub. So this is a freeze right here. This is not about the CBD, by the way that is a primary ingredient but it's about other components. So, the question is, you need to be able to get the CBD and the pain relief chemical into your skin. Right. So it depends on else the manufacturer puts in there to help it seep into the skin. The first thing, is you want to be very clear that it actually says CBD. CBD.\nPeriod. Because, that's right. CBD, it's gotta say that, number one. Number two. So you want to look to see what it says about THC. THC free.\nThis is THC free, very good. The other thing is, you want to make sure it tells you what type of CBD it is. This is very important, pay attention. So here, it says pure isolate. What that means is that the product is 99.9% CBD. It's as pure as you can get it. So it doesn't have any THC. But there's also something called broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means that not only does it have CBD, it has the other cannabinoids I mentioned before. Right. Other good chemicals for you. It's broad spectrum. And lastly, there's something that's called full spectrum. This is where you have to pay attention. Full spectrum means it actually has THC. Okay? So, when you see isolate, that's pure CBD. When you see broad spectrum it's other cannabinoids but still no THC. When you see full spectrum It includes the THC.\nIt includes the THC. Please look at the ingredient list. Because you want to know actually what's in there. So make sure you do that. And lastly, make sure it tells you how many milligrams are on here. Right?\nAnd that's where you get that huge price discrepancy. Ah, there you go.\nThat's right. There you go. So, if the price looks too good to be true. It is.\nIt is. (laughs)\nIt ain't true. Because CBD cost money and so if you want high quality I'm not saying you have to break the bank on it. And it's buyer beware. Yes.\nLike, you really do have to study up on this. You can't just dive in. Please. And the last thing I want to say. (crowd claps) The last thing I want to say is this. A lot of these products have a QR code on it. And you can take your phone and put it up and look at the certificate of analysis. Make sure that the product has been third party tested. Which means they've sent it out to a third party lab to test to make sure it has what is says it has and doesn't have, which you don't want. That's so true of every supplement and vitamin.

reported using marijuana during pregnancy were more than one and a half times more likely to have autism than children who were not exposed researchers looked at 2200 ontario women who gave birth between 2007 and 2012 and said that they used cannabis while pregnant the research was done by the ottawa hospital chill born ontario and the university of ottawa joining me now with more is dr doreen alchar co-author of the study good morning thank you so much doctor for being with us good morning first of all give us your thoughts on what the research found sure so you summaried summarize it nicely but our research was really looking at maternal cannabis and neurodevelopmental outcomes after having looked at it previously in obstetrical outcomes last year and we noted the increase in the diagnosis of autism that was made in children born to mothers who had consumed cannabis during the time of our study period which is about 10 years when you look at the follow-up period of when they were born and then to how long we followed them so were the researchers more interested in looking at why autism occurs or what happens if mothers use cannabis during pregnancy what was your starting point yeah so for this study in particular it was around neurodevelopmental outcome we've previously looked at what happens to pregnancies and we found an increased rate of preterm birth and some other obstacle outcomes which were affected like birth weight and other placental issues um so we we generated more work from that existing uh interest uh to now look at the feed the the babies and the infant outcomes so this is focused on the neural development and brain so autism was one but we also looked at other intellectual learning disabilities and found less of a significant association so there are health warnings out there about using cannabis during pregnancy is your feeling that those warnings are not being followed it's hard to know right now and as you mentioned yes health canada society of obstetrician gynecologist we still recommend against use because we don't have enough evidence to talk to our mothers about what it could mean i think that we probably are seeing similar rates and maybe a little bit more upfront patients telling us about the use because of legalization so that we may be seeing however we haven't looked at the numbers yet but we plan on doing that now to see what the numbers are post-legalization in 2017. right i guess i'm wondering why people why pregnant women would use cannabis is it because it is legal now people think that it may not be um harmful during pregnancy to their baby so certainly that's one there's always the impression that if something is legal it may be okay but we know that that's certainly not the problem the issue with other substances like alcohol and smoking so i use the same analogy um as in terms of why they use it certain moms do need to use it because they've used it for other medical issues for pain management or uh dealing with other symptoms so certainly we have to be aware of and helping those uh patients with other uh uh you know other medications that they will need to have to deal with their uh medical issues as well as there's some people who use it recreationally still as well as for potential help with nausea so this was a big study what do you hope to do with the results uh yeah so this is one of the largest studies and more recent times published we hope that this will help sensitize you know and help our care providers counsel their patients about some of the risks and certainly we know we need to do more studies and continue looking at the cohorts of patients as this was from 20 2007 to 2012 so we need to look at more recent data and continue doing linkage and we also need to look at whether timing of use and other substances affect the outcomes as well as different types of cannabis as you know there's many different forms that can be used doctor thank you so much really appreciate you being with us this morning on this study very important", "pAOZ1Z_KFrw": "so we have a regime in Canada where there's actually laws that allow for recreational use as well as for medicinal use and the medicinal side patients have to register and the cannabis use has to be authorized by a physician rise on the recreational side basically anybody can go and buy cannabis at an approved licensed location so you have two regimes which I believe creates some issues when it comes to use on the medical for medical purposes because patients basically have open access to cannabis what we're seeing is that there's this expectation and the patient side that cannabis is going to be this wonderful treatment for their pain and on the science side there isn't the evidence to truly support that and so I feel very strongly that there's a there's a need for well conducted trials to truly evaluate the benefit of cannabis in this setting but it's almost like the horses are out of the barn patients want it and we have to find ways to better educate patients engage them as well as do the research to actually show whether it's going to be helpful or not as health care professionals we are because the scientific evidence isn't there there isn't the knowledge to use cannabis for medical purposes pain management for example in this setting and so we have a large information gap from the perspective of cannabis and its use in the setting which product to use how much THC how much CBD the dose which way and it should be administered so there's a lot of questions that as healthcare professionals we have and yet again I go back to my comment earlier that patients still want to use it so we have to find a way to embedder engage patients so the consultation service at our Center was really the result of clinicians telling us they were having patients ask them about the use of cannabis for medical purposes in the oncology setting and not knowing what to tell them we had developed some expertise within the pharmacy department I basically went to them and said we can do this we refer patients to us we screen patients we try to better understand what the patient expectations are in terms of the use of medical cannabis or cannabis for medical purposes we assess them in terms of their symptoms and then we feel if there's a need for cannabis or that cannabis may be an option once traditional ways of managing that say pain have been exhausted then we lead the patient and the clinician through the process of registering with with the government approved grower choosing the products and then dosing the product helping the patient go through the dosing of the medication to see if it's going to benefit them we also follow the patient to assess whether it's working or whether it's having any side effects so in a nutshell that's the program we're trying to ensure the safe use of cannabis for medical purposes in our patients can stay with the medical the cannabis side I think there are I actually believe there is a role for cannabis in the management about adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or the symptoms that cancer can cause itself there's a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done and that's the exciting part in terms of understanding the underlying mechanisms in terms of side effects and how cannabis can be used to address or to target these underlying mechanisms so we have a research program that we have started looking at very specific adverse effects of chemotherapy that may be immune related and how cannabis can actually modulate the immune system to reduce the side effects for example taxane acute pain syndrome is a is an area that we're very interested in we think that potentially fatigue could be managed by cannabis certainly anxiety seems to be a really important issue with with our patients and we've had some success in managing anxiety with with cannabis in that setting through our consultation service sleep disorders also seem to be at least from our experience and the consultation service seem to be amenable to the use of cannabis as well so I think there's a potential for a broad range of uses once we have the research to prove it", "lWGFF3mlP84": "hi Popham Barkley what is the CBD topical great question I'm Lewis CBD topicals are anything from oil to salve when applied they offer anti-inflammatory pain relief in other qualities want to know more go to this link", "4x58Xq2OpuE": "[Music] hey everybody my name is Katerina and I'm the chief dessert designer and founder of dolled up desserts and today I'm gonna walk you through a super simple but super delicious baked good recipe but this isn't any ordinary baked good today I'm really excited to show you my version of a completely vegan green magic pie but what makes these green magic buyers is a special ingredient called cannabis the good thing about this recipe is that if you don't want to infuse you don't have to totally your choice we're leaving that option up to you but you can still make this recipe and start to finish without infusing your treat I'll make sure I specifically show you how to infuse and then if you choose not to no worries they're your treats after all anyways without further ado let's get baking those green magic bars so the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna take our Oreo we're going to open it right up and we're going to take out the inside now you're gonna take your Oreos you stick them in your blender magic bullet whatever you have it's really anything that blade will work and we're gonna repeat this until your magic bullet is kind of about a quarter of the way through we're gonna be making about a cup and a half of ground Oreo crumbs and you're gonna put your Oreo filling to the side once you've got enough Oreos in here you're gonna crush them up using a magic bullet or whatever blender you have just until they are a very very fine crumb [Music] you're in separate Royals grind them up until you end up with about cup and a half to two cups of Oreos next thing you gonna do is you're gonna take your coconut oil and you're gonna add it into the crumbs of the Oreo we have about half a cup of coconut oil here and we're gonna add in also a little bit of brown sugar mix it all together essentially just gonna mix it until it becomes sticky where I get my hands dirty you'll know it's good once it kind of comes together clumps together like this once you've got your Oreo crust into a sticky ball like sort of texture you're going to grab a 9 by 9 inch pan lined with parchment paper and you're gonna take all of your Oreo from and you're gonna put it right in and I'm gonna use my spatula and I'm gonna press it down so now's the point where we would infuse the treats I'm going to infuse the crust now normally when you're baking with an infused cannabis butter or oil you would put it in with a baked good mix it up really well add some soy lecithin in this case because the oil might not necessarily be a hundred percent properly dispersed in a crust we're actually going to use an eyedropper and we're going to dose it based on the number of squares that we're going to cut out of this bar so the oil that I'm using today I infused to be ten milligrams of THC to four grams of coconut oil an important number and that calculation you need to have because now I know that I have to put four grams of coconut oil per square that I'm making to show that I'm going to actually divide this into nine bars right now I'm going to then take my melted coconut Kanna butter and I'm going to drop four grams into each I know that four grams of this oil is ten droppers full of his-- so I'm gonna drop it in now that our bars have been infused they ready to go let's finish this off we're going to dump a full bag of desiccated unsweetened coconut right on top read it right out to the corners then we're gonna top it off with some vegan Belgian dark chocolate and for people like me who like nuts we're gonna top it off with some walnuts you can omit this you can also add whatever else you want in this place use pecans you can use pretzels you can use really anything that's crunchy you can use nothing at all totally your choice and for the final piece the piece that sticks it all together we're gonna throw in some coconut condensed milk don't worry about it being loopy or kind of sticky on the top it will sink in it will bake in and once it's been spread out it's time to put this bad boy into the oven you're gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes you'll know it's done when the top is golden brown looks a little crispy and everything looks dark but not on the verge of burn all right so our wonderful green dream magic bars have come out of the oven here absolutely gorgeous super caramelized you can notice around the edges they're kind of on the brown side borderline holes for it without the perfect amount of caramelization especially for the middle to make sure it's fully cooked all the way through the last bit to add a little bit of pizzazz is we're gonna take all those Oreo middles that we saved add a little bit of water to it you can also add a non-dairy milk your choice I'm gonna whisk it up and then we're gonna throw it in this piping bag and drizzle it right on the top it's gonna be amazing we're gonna now cut these bars to get them out of the pan if you want to take the whole thing out of the pan I highly suggest you freeze it before we try taking it out cuz it'll be very tricky to get out but it is easier if you just cut them into bars before you go remember when you're cutting your bars to cut them based off of the doses you needed before so we said nine squares so we're gonna cut about where's and that's it ladies and gents this is how easy it is to make a delicious dream bar which can also be a in green bar totally up to you if you want to learn more about how to safely use and eat cannabis in your baked goods or food make sure you check out our youtube channel or dolled up desserts comm for really simple tips and tricks on how to get it right and make sure you're infusing safely and properly now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna sample a little one of these guys right now cheers guys so good thanks so much for watching guys [Music]", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system

Andrew ordered with the doctor says there's not enough evidence to support whether this type of treatment works the key is if you're thinking about trying it you need to see a pediatrician who specializes in using marijuana and especially in dosing marijuana CBD oil for your kid before I took cannabis my brain was normal and then after I took cannabis all of these years my brain was the same and it didn't harm anything Riley's now made it her mission to help other sick kids get the medicine they need speaking in front of legislature she's already pushed to pass three laws in Delaware one makes it legal for kids in the state to be administered medical marijuana another lets children take it at school O'Reilly law was to make cannabis legal for children because it was illegal and when my mom gave me cannabis it made me feel so much better and I didn't understand why other kids wouldn't have it I wanted to help those kids hi she's also created the nonprofit Riley's smile foundation it's very hard knowing what helped you and seeing other people who could be helped by it bringing smiles to sick children and their families by giving them a better quality of life just

cannabis might be the most beneficial for all age groups we'll discuss why cannabis might be the most beneficial to seniors of all the age groups we'll talk a little bit about dosing and why that's so important what about drug interactions and then how to maybe gently nudge the senior in your life to giving cannabis a try hi my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis wellness coach and educator at reveal cannabis calm at that website you're gonna find lots of great stuff including a free video and a free recipe book for you about cannabis plus you can check out my online upcoming events or my online classes there's lots of stuff going on there so please head to reveal cannabis calm thank you here in Canada where I am seniors really love their cannabis in fact for first-time users of cannabis seniors are the quickest growing group which I think is so exciting but this isn't just a Canada wide phenomenon these same the same pattern is happening all over the world that more and more seniors are coming to cannabis because they've heard about how beneficial it might be so how could they benefit what are the conditions that some seniors are stuff is suffering from that cannabis might be able to help well arthritis is huge what about neurodegenerative diseases things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and dementia cannabis has been shown to help with all of those and there's many exciting studies coming up about this topic pain cannabis is excellent for pain helps with depression it helps with cancer and the side effects of chemo or radiation it can help you get a good night's sleep and a good night's sleep can make all the difference in the world for all your other conditions it helps with increasing your appetite helps with eye pressure from glaucoma it helps with brittle bones and there's so much more but seniors are also the group who may suffer from the most stigmatization from this plant even if they were consuming cannabis in the 60s and 7 is the huge anti-drug propaganda you know that just say no campaign didn't really get started until the 80s so even if they tried cannabis and loved it and their youth they may still have gotten the same program even but all of us have gotten about how evil this drug is so it might be really hard to convince them that there's some therapeutic value and seniors have lots of questions about this but there's not a lot of reliable resources for them to turn to it's very difficult for most seniors to talk to their doctors about cannabis because most doctors at least in Canada don't have a real clear handle on how cannabinoids work in the body so let's talk about dosing here because this is really gonna be make-or-break for everyone not just seniors but if we think about dosing we're thinking mostly about THC so THC is one of the components in the cannabis plant and it provides that high or you fork or stoned feeling at high doses which some people really enjoy and they need that uplifting perk but for some people that's really off-putting but in low doses you don't feel any of those things so starting with a very low dose of THC around 2 milligrams is a great way to start or you could avoid THC altogether and stick to some of the other cannabinoids so lots of people have access to CBD and it is excellent for pain and sleep and inflammation and for mood or there's some other molecules that the cannabis plant grows none of them make you feel high or stoned except for THC so maybe looking at cbn or CBD or some of the other beneficial properties that the plant produces or if you only have access to high THC plants THC doesn't actually grow on the plant when the plant grows it grows a compound called THC a and in order to get THC we have to heat it up so you do that by lighting your joint or heating up your vaporizer or cooking your cannabis for a bit before you infuse it into butter and oil and putting it into an edible if you do that process first which is heating it up it's called d carbon if you don't heat up your cannabis your high THC cannabis you're left with high THC a cannabis which still has many of the same properties it's anti-inflammatory it helps with brain cells it helps with throwing up and nausea it helps with sleep it helps with muscle spasms but no psycho activity so maybe thinking about THCA is a way to approach dosing and again there it is start with really small doses to start what about side effects so yes cannabis has some side effects all the side effects that you hear about are from high THC flower CBD even at very high doses does not have any negative side effects except for some people don't deal well with the oil that they're taking like it's a lot on their gastrointestinal system the oil so CBD no known side effects THC has them all but all of these side effects dissipate with time so just like when you're starting to take a new pharmaceutical medication and the doctor says you know you might have a headache or you might not sleep well for a couple of weeks but it'll go away the same thing happens with THC most people get used to the side effects and they don't bother them anymore here they are so paranoia and anxiety dry mouth dry eyes hunger no munchies sleepiness short-term memory loss like if you ever can't find your keys Racing heart and this is very startling for seniors the racing heart usually lasts about 15 or 20 minutes and then goes away but it's still scary and blood pressure might be affected so actually your blood pressure might lower because cannabis causes your your blood vessels to open up to dilate a little bit so those are some of the common side effects that you can get from THC and again that's very dose dependent so I always suggest to people who have lots of cannabis sorry lots of conditions or lots of or there are lots of medications to speak with a cannabis specific doctor here in Canada we have access to them for free you do most of the appointments just over the computer over or over the phone so you don't even have to leave your house in the States it's a little bit trickier you have to be in a legal state and then find a doctor who will write you a prescription some of the things that they might look for our if you or the senior in your life is taking prescription medications that the doctor has said to them don't consume grapefruit while you're taking this prescription med you must be careful with CBD as well the same enzymes that break down certain drugs CBD interferes with them so your drugs don't get broken down as quickly which means you might have higher levels of those pharmaceutical medications in your bloodstream then you're supposed to so it's important to speak with a doctor if you're on any um drugs but interact with grapefruit things like opioids benzodiazepines which are for sleep and other psychotropic meds and a sleeping meds all of those can have an interaction with cannabis as well and seamless um blood thinners I don't think I have it on here but if you you're on coumadin or a blood thinner it's very important to speak with your doctor I recommend Apollo of cannabis clinics I just really like their model of patient care and there's a link down below so that you can get set up with them if you'd like and here in Canada lots of seniors lots of people think that the only way to take cannabis is to smoke it and it's really exciting for them to see that there's other ways to consume this plant that don't have to do with smoking people smoked for a reason it's quick and it's convenient and as soon as you consume cannabis but via smoking you start to feel relief instantly it doesn't take very long but lots of people don't like the smell or the taste of cigarette of joint smoke so um people are moving to vaporizing which is a small handheld unit that heats up cannabis flour so you put some cannabis bud or flour in the device it heats it up and it vaporizes the molecules so it vaporizes the THC and the CBD and you inhale the vapor and exhale the vapor so it works really quickly but it doesn't have any of the same smell or the tar or anything that we associate with smoking so moving to a dry herb vaporizer is a good option for many people just because it works so quickly edibles or capsules so lots of seniors prefer to start with capsulized cannabis oil because it's familiar it looks just like a regular pharmaceutical pill so people are familiar with it it also makes dosing really easy because they come in pre dosed they come in pre dosed little capsules edibles are a little bit more tricky because they have to be metabolized and sometimes when you get older your metabolism doesn't keep up so it could take quite a lot longer for the Edible to kick in so just being aware of that that to leave a really long time between edible doses to make sure that the dose is working transdermal patches are great for those people who forget to take their meds you just slap one on your arm and then next week you slap a new one on it's a slow week slow release CBD or THC mixture under the tongue tinctures are fantastic too you just drop some cannabis oil under your tongue and hold it there for about half a minute and you feel relief relatively quickly within about 15 or 20 minutes again no smell and it's very discreet but in my opinion the like gateway drug for people to get on to cannabis is to give them a sab or a lotion when you apply cannabis cream - let's say painful hands or feet it works very quickly and you don't there's no possible way for you to get high so even if you gave even if you tried a very high THC cream you might get excellent pain relief but you'll have no psychotropic feelings so for lots of seniors once they see or feel the benefits of pain relief from topical cannabis they're more interested or curious about taking it in a different way so how do you convince the senior in your life to give cannabis a try here are some things that I've come up with just some thoughts that maybe you can chat with them about so lots of like we talked about lots of baby boomers once tried cannabis a long time ago and now they're coming back to it so maybe talking to them about the difference of how some cannabis plants are grown now that there's lots of producers and growers who are growing for medicinal purposes maybe they're going to grow the best strain for sleep or for pain relief it's not all about getting high anymore so talking to them about that talking to them about how cannabis is much much are potent than it was in the 60s or 70s maybe about three times as potent so if somebody was used to smoking a joint back in the day and they decide to light one up now in 2020 it could be a very bad experience for them so giving them that information again try starting with topical or maybe a capsule because it looks more familiar and be considerate about the cannabinoids you use maybe you stay clear of THC like we talked about if you have questions about this or anything else to do with cannabis please just drop them in the comments below I do answer all of them and please go ahead to my website check out all that I have going on there

okay but just because conventional medicine doesn't have a cure I refused to believe I'm out of options there are many stories on the internet of cancer patients who say their lives have been saved by cannabis like Darren Blackwell who was just days from death at the age of 14 the doctors had done all they could his mum who'd been giving him cannabis oil for the pain boosted the dose and Darren made a sudden recovery Darren lamb bill nice to meet you how are you I'm getting itchy hello Carly how are you five years later he still fit and well I was bones and flesh and fat all in nothing else there was barely any blood in me so he come just give you a good path to death yes yeah then you didn't die yeah yeah that was the difficult compartment because because I wanted to die so the dying part was easy you just have to relax Inka like deal without how I had accepted it the crucial question is to what extent you feel that cannabis kept you alive ninety percent Manchester I was gone mentally just walking around like a zombie and then I came back and I recovered really quickly it was really strange it kick-started my immune system and my bone marrow it helped do something to it there's no doubt about that the addition of the cannabis helped Darren's story fills me with hope but while he's convinced that cannabis saved him there's no medical proof so to discuss the science of it I'm meeting dr. Peter McCormick one of the top cancer scientists in the UK so what's the difference between cancerous cells and regular cells yes so cancerous cells start to grow uncontrollably and become a large mass and they don't respond to the stop grow signals that normally come from the body so basically these cells are not getting the message from management that they should be dying correct or they're just not lit they're willfully not listening correct okay so how do you make them this well you try to identify what makes those cells unique versus a healthy cell and put in what we call a silver bullet to try and kill those cells and what's the closest you come to the silver bullet in this case we're studying cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid is a small molecule naturally occurring in cannabis at Eva's cannabinoid receptors you can think of as radio transmitters of cells and what we've discovered is that one of these cannabinoid receptors is higher expressed in cancer cells so there's more of it in a cancer cell than a healthy cell and we're trying to take advantage of that imbalance to kill off and tell that cancer cells stop growing so if you put the right kind of cannabinoids into that petri dish there it'll kill them off correct that's great what about in my case I've got advanced prostate cancer metastasized it's in the bone yeah so we've done some work on prostate cancers and it looks like in certain cases you can get prostate cancers which will respond to cannabinoid there you", "rAgXFXZ3Q2s": "now guy now starting as soon as I said the word alright everyone welcome back today feathers back with and we've got some tincture from Batman aka make it Wayne is his YouTube channel now this was made by Mark Wilkerson now Tyler's never tried tincture before I've explained it to him a little bit so if you don't know what tincture is is it's an alcohol you put you add pepper powder or and or pepper pods to it you let it set four to six weeks or longer and at the end you just get this concentrated liquid that's very spicy it's not necessarily extract so you want me to go first yeah sure all right so I've taken five drops of this today I'm just gonna go ahead and do a hope well my hope out well I'll try to do a vow that's about 3/4 of a vowel there I think a little drops about to fall out what did it is first and we'll pass it off Taylor you're do about three drops let's start out with three and then we'll go from whatever so it's pretty warm are off the bat go ahead start the timer pretty one right off the bat strong pepper

obviously but as far as Reaper or scorpion I can't really tell so part of me wants to lay off a little bit of Reaper Beth same time I don't really know because you you mentioned last video like you can see when it's a Reaper you know it's a rebirth euro necessarily get a lot of that possibly but we could be dead wrong cuz I have no idea Oh text message mark or Batman and try to find out leaving the description but a little shout-out to POC paper the community chased capsaicin Oh hot pepper grows a society chase the heat couple other a Facebook group thank you all for the support a lot of you guys who make videos in those areas have shouted me out a pretty good luck no alright reason I say that is pepper bought Nick mentioned that Tyler should be my first permanent guest and so I guess if

thing about this though is it makes your eyes water a little little bit yeah but you're not like porn tears you not sweat you know I haven't been he sweat back here nothing like that I did cry headache cry but uh little thing I was lucky enough to get Johnny scar on his left live chat once upon a time and I asked him about tinctures and he he recommended it for increase the tolerance you pick some or put something yeah no no better not so you recommended tinctures for increase in dollars yeah talk to him innocent he he said the same thing I agree because just the other night I ate those five five pods and I've never ever been able to buy pods before I ever every sway almost there yeah we got 20 seconds I made it we're good so go for the drive you made it though hey so yeah if

"Xr293EcpDFE": "early on a really close family friend of my father's daughter was was targeted and murdered in the 80s it was a big case I'd probably had nervous breakdowns before that that was the first time I can remember like oh this is a nervous breakdown it makes you realize that it's like no matter how good the people around you are she can fall apart my name is dr. Siri Satnam Singh and I'm a licensed therapist this week I'm sitting down with a man who is battling depression and deeply-rooted shame today we will witness him confronting his fast this is Damian Abraham [Music] [Music] so your past I know nothing about it yes mother and father what was all about I grew up upper-middle class middle class I guess my mom was a flight attendant my dad was in advertising my mom had a heart attack at 40 and had to stop being a flight attendant and then my they'd been divorced by that point we had a terrible stepfather okay and he did it kind of everything wrong and I think the other thing that ultimately was the shattering thing was he was such a moralist right like this is around the time Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky and I can remember sitting at the dinner table and he was like they should throw him in jail like Bo claw it was this very like I didn't get along with them politically at that point but then just to kind of have this like it's like sort of ultimate alpha male vision of this is what you should do you should work hard you know I'm a pilot but I also had another job filling vending machines I do this and I do that you know and I'm raising you children to be polite and use manners and respect people you know he had a another life that he was dealing with too so but he it wasn't a great dude yeah and then it's you know it's the things that we're not aware of that really impact our lives so the moralist stepdad I'm sure you had impulses that you wanted to act out that you could not act out because this is not good that's unconscious shaming yeah yeah talk about that some of the impulses you may have had that he said ah dinner so much anxiety is stress around family dinner you know it was really important that we all sat down together and then it was there are a lot of rules you know like how we set the table you know and how we conducted ourselves at that table and it wasn't like we're sitting in a formal dining room dressed up this was just that the dinner table the breakfast table and I think there's a lot of stress around that it was like a shells like it was like a time bomb sitting across the dinner table from this person like what little inconsistency have I forgotten now I have I made that I wasn't supposed to that's gonna set this guy off and it was never like a physical abuse but it was like not talking to you for like two or three days cuz you ran down the stairs it was a very bizarre you see how you internalize that change yeah yes he shamed you yeah and you internalized the shame that because I put the fork this way and it should have been that way that I am not good looking at your videos the word that came out to me is raised it's not just anger on the stage it's rage definitely yes and rage is a ramification of dealing with shame and a number of artists it's not a through-line but this concept that you have been chained unconsciously that you know I'm not good enough and you defend against it divided because a star everything's still bare I am invisible down here on the same level no one should see me because I'm bad so you defend against it and come to a level to where everybody will see me on stage it's it's another form of dealing with shame exhibitionism the where I will dance so fast and seeing so loud and be so flamboyant and be so grand that no one will see that I feel less than no absolutely it's like it's it's a it's an armor yeah you know like you put it on and you could be that other person yeah so you haven't identified from my perspective up to the day consciously that you are shame-based talk about your experience as a teenage boy here it is dad is gone at when did dad leave dad left when I was grade five so I think I would have been about 12 my dad was British he moved back to England moved to Los Angeles for a while then moved back to Toronto so at the age of 16 I went straight edge which is like a way to be sober you know and identify with something in your sobriety which is as a kid it was so important to me you know so I could be straight edge which meant I didn't do drugs I didn't train I didn't do any of that stuff and I I was part of this thing and then I did that you know and I straighted stop me being important to me after a couple years but I still called myself straightedge just as you know shorthand for it well let's not fail you coming to the get room now yes so where do you feel like you feel is a child I don't know I guess it like I guess like I had struggled in school in the very beginning grade one I was diagnosed with a learning disability that I've kind of come to realize was actually my exam anxiety disorder at that age kind of manifesting itself I would have panic attacks learning new concepts so anxiety around I know failure anxiety around what else I'm talking to a fat kid trust me there's a lot to get okay let's work through it being a young teenager preety can do is perceived as housing having breasts you know yeah I was like you know I had to go swimming with these people you know and and it was a physical shaming you know I think it was more like a body shaming thing it was I was the fat kid I want you to have empathy for the child that experienced that I think that's the one that we need to bring into the session the one that maybe on the stage and you punk-rock the one who maybe unconsciously showing up in places I made a name for myself by having a crazy live show early on it would be bloody and it would be chaotic smashing you know and I was big I was huge at that time I look at that now that was a panic attack like I was just like going up there and freaking the on stage and like hurting myself you know I was definitely reckless in my behavior and that's a panic attack and you know it's almost like to get to that to play that fool on stage every night to be that person for people you almost have to get to that panic attack stage what is coming to the space so far is fear mm-hmm anxiety of course that you're trying desperately to stay controlled and I think that's key to the panic attack and the nervous breakdowns to where you're trying to desperately stay in control of these feelings and then you can and then he explode and what are some of the symptoms you have when you have a panic attack like a lack of joy you know just a general like it's it's it's all gone I would just be like tossing and turning at night just worried about anything everything and I think the problem is being in a band it just hyper accentuates those feelings because it's like you're your kind of you live and die based on what someone else thinks about you and I think that's probably why I'm hesitant writing lyrics for the new record you know it's probably why I'm hesitant to to do other things that I want to do creatively is because you don't want to fail on it so what are we gonna do with this critic stepfather was a critic yes the teachers were a critic yes your friends were a critic yes and you still haven't escaped it that you have these musical critics what are you gonna do with that that's a the big question I guess yes I think the critic is inside of you so you're working all day with these shames although you see what I'm saying in different ways it's yeah there's a lot of shame but I also like the other piece of it I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing without this you know without my mental health whatever it is that I've dealt with I wouldn't be fortunate to be able to live this dream you know like I kind of manifested my own destiny in that way yeah well you have something you have obviously some self-love there too but that shame is in there with the self love so it's like toxic cocktail yeah yeah yeah so this reminds me of Anna Freud where she talked about when we are aggressed against that eventually we aggress against ourselves yeah we we no longer need the perpetrator to beat us over the head now we incorporate that aggression against ourselves and that's what you're doing you were beat into it you gotta be perfect you got to be perfect thus I'm not good enough so plus I can't write though I'm travelling all over the world and being recognized yet I can't write on my new album because I'm not good enough so we have to release the inner critic we gotta let him go I'm experiencing you as a man who's very present with his feelings attributions and I think that you have a lot of feelings that that come all the time all the time and really fast you and you are having challenge processing them as quickly as they come I find it like depending on the situation it's hard to let that River flow you know like I think every situation where it's hard to let it flow first day of this tour was like I get I would arrive in the city we pick up the van pick up all the gear drive to the show this case it was Phoenix Arizona which needs five hours in that van in five hours we don't we're not like a band of friends you know there's like bands you hear about them they're like we're all buddies that's not us like why do we fly to LA to pick up a van to then drive to Arizona and then drive all the way back the next day thus spending 12 hours in a tiny little van together that we already hate being in each other with beside each other inside of it and were then we're gonna have to drive all the way up to Vancouver in a van with each other yet for some reason we thought an extra five hours was worth saving a few dollars so phone's idea that to you oh hi yes do you feel I'll be pissed I just think how they feel oh I do this is identification with the aggressor your stepfather a Mian that's not good what are you doing you should never do this so now you have identified with the aggressor and you have become him I don't like the person I become like you know I don't like the way I treat people you know and I find like I don't like the way I treat myself I don't like the way yeah like I it's cool well I should say whenever you speak to your sauna to your van gesture to your wife or whomever that you become aware that they have the potential to reacting to me and not doing what I would like to happen because I'm shaming right I find it I find I can get that place after I've lost my temper and I'm almost like I can't get out of that place after I've lost my temper you know where I'm less like there's almost like too much empathy at that point like I feel so bad for what I did to them yeah so how can we this is just behavioral stuff now so can you be aware of something of that that that's something that you really would like to change that's right yeah I definitely I can see it's like the panic reaction you know I'm like I was quick to fight you know when I was growing up as a younger kid you know it was just like a trigger temper you know and it was just no I'm and it's been trying to get these emotions in check you know it's work what's the word yeah definitely it's work yeah I would love like to be able to get away from that and do away with it I found cannabis is my closest the closest time to that but before I had cannabis oh my god let's go there my early 20s I was seeing a woman her family went through unbelievable violence I had a breakdown came back to Toronto got put on paxil Bute Hren ativan a bunch I can't probably remember the names of I've tried them all and then about six years ago after ten years of these drugs I was in Holland that cycled off my pills again because I didn't like the side-effects felt the panic kind of coming on weed was everywhere turned someone in my band smoking weed so can I try it everyone looked at me like I was lost my mind cuz I'd never done it and immediately it just something happened I could look at myself outside of the anxiety it allowed me to slow down the emotions the flood of emotions and kind of take them as they came and at first I was I was you talk about shame imagine being strain it and identifying is a sober person and the strength than that for 15 years and then trying to drink or in my case smoke weed a lot of strange kids go through this weird thing when they break when they break edge so I felt weird guilt about it at first but then I realized it was working for me and then the weight loss came I was drinking like 6 liters of soda a day you know things like that like now I don't drink soda um but that was cannabis that allowed me to look at that and be like that's gross that's a lot of sugar no one should drink that much sugar and I don't know it I really gained a lot of perspective you know so you have found something that works for you that has been legalized yes it's a I find there opee and it certainly the cannabis have been the best ways to kind of to deal with stuff yeah and it takes time to release this this stuff Shane is the worst feeling that I have come up with in my clients it's just the face because it takes away your love of yourself it goes to the bone it's to the core I think I told a lot more shame about my mental health in my early 20s once I was diagnosed and I was put on those prescriptions but I think later once I kind of gained control of my mental health and gained a little bit of power over it I find working on it it makes me feel stronger this is something that's challenging and it's just let's say it's gonna be challenging for you to overcome this oh it's definitely challenging to overcome this yes and to be easy on yourself but yet if you continue to give it conscious focus it will change it was shift [Music] have you ever done breath of fire I don't think so so you inhale this time he goes out thanks how it goes in exhale close your eyes this is the center of self I want you to open your mouth wide this is the stuff that really transforms you from one session to the next I want you to see yourself there's a little boy at home at school with friends I want you to see when that little boy was unconsciously or consciously shamed don't judge it just experience it and when we experience it in this time in space we are releasing the shame these repressed memories see that lo vuoi how he was shamed for house with his learning disability with his weight at home at the dinner table don't run away from it get into the breath of paranoia let the fear come up don't run away from it the deeper you go the freer you be when you leave here and this safe space feel it [Laughter] inhale exhale let it go let it go let it go let it go what's in the room right now what are you feeling right now having gone through this process I feel for the first time an awareness of how deep shame goes and that the fact that the shame that I experience internally isn't necessarily the result of negative things that were put on me it might have just been innocent critiques of people's you know best intentions I think I also you know like maybe like a little bit of permission for myself to try and enjoy this a little bit more because it's it's it's fleeting and it would be fun to enjoy it while it's happening as opposed to regret it okay okay well end our session with angel cards and I just throw it to the unknown and let the unknown communicate to my client and see if you get some communication from the unknown from spirit I came in to myself we're gonna share it share it okay commitment okay what does that mean to you I think for me it's gonna be commitment to improving you know my mental and spiritual health you know like in emotional health - I guess - as well but bringing commitment to kind of like working on that you know and then it is something you have to be committed to and work out every day it only gets better when they work at it every day so that's what I you know take for that one well good good good good well I think our sessions come to an end and it's been a great session but thank you very much for having me thank you for being here [Music]

including heart attacks and heart failure janae norman has the details good morning janae hey george good morning yeah would you believe that during the pandemic the marijuana business is booming already on track to outpace all of last year as the aha took a look at how both recreational and medicinal use impact cardiovascular health this morning as sales of marijuana soared during the pandemic a new warning from the american heart association that the marijuana millions use may actually be hurting their hearts in a new review of studies the organization finding cannabis use may be linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure there have certainly been reports of people with heart rhythm abnormalities hospitalized patients who have more complications of their heart attack for example when they're hospitalized with a heart attack or heart failure dr rosemarie robertson the deputy chief science and medical officer of the aha cautioning more research needs to be done after multiple studies found smoking the the in cannabis could shrink blood vessels that feed the heart and lungs i think it's clear to us that using marijuana thinking that it might help your heart or be good for the cardiovascular system there is no evidence for that the evidence that it can harm you is also anecdotal but there is some researchers also finding that edible marijuana appears to be associated with even more harmful heart and psychiatric complications because of the amount of thc absorbed into the body system but cbd is different studies finding that the portion of the marijuana plant that doesn't produce a high has actually been associated with a reduced heart rate and lower blood pressure this as purchases of marijuana spike when the country went on lockdown in march more than a dozen states deemed cannabis stores and medical marijuana dispensaries essential businesses in colorado retail marijuana sales in may were 35 million dollars higher than in 2019. and both oregon and washington state seeing their cannabis sales spike through the late spring and early summer as consumers spend more time at home and so more research is needed and the aha suggests that the dea remove cannabis as a schedule one controlled substance so that it can be widely studied because as it stands now as a schedule one drug cannabis is defined as having no medical use and a

Trevino the executive chef of by Chloe and we're here today to make an A to C V de cookie just one of my favorite friends giving treats it has a little CBD in it to get everybody in the festive mood and ready to have a great time so to start we're gonna go with a little bit of vegan margarine and to this margarine that's when we want to add our CBD oil and to that we're gonna add our sugars so here we have brown sugar and cane sugar start slowly at first we start at a high speed everything's just gonna end up on the walls great so what you're looking for here is a nice well blended product to this we're gonna add our dry our dry consists of flour cornstarch baking soda and a little bit of salt mixing everything together building up from there to about medium speed at that point your cookie mixture will look like wet sand now for the wet ingredients we're just gonna put a little water and a little vanilla extract now we want to mix this as well starting slow building up till everything is well incorporated in the mixture looks fluffy so then I'm mixtures nice well incorporated and fluffy so we'll start with some chocolate chips mix the chocolate chips just - they're all mixed in and incorporated off the bowl now we'll go with the pecans you just want to run it slow until it's all incorporated just a couple turns will do that's good now we do pretzels these are little salted pretzels that we love to use the salt is nice it gives you a nice contrast of the sweetness of the cookie marshmallows these are vegan marshmallows and last but not least potato chips so the potato chips are gonna crush themselves inside so we just fold them in I'll let the machine do the work now we're doing this at the slowest speed possible and that's it we'll take the cookie dough right out of the bowl and so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna grab small handfuls and just form them and then almost into a patty shape almost like little pucks and you lay them on a sheet pan and then we'll bake them in a low oven we bake these at 320 degrees you really don't want to bake anything with CBD in it higher than 320 degrees because you'll lose those wonderful effects that it has so we bake these at 320 degrees seven minutes on one side we'll rotate the tray and bake it seven minutes on the other so they're nice and even so everything kind of melts the marshmallow Browns a little bit you see the pretzel sticking out there chocolate chips are nice and gooey and it's just an overall fun cookie [Music]", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for

infused honey Spears and he's gonna show us how to make them David we're gonna be having an infused Pakistani dinner and for the dessert we wanted to get a really special kind of infused honey because Pakistani desserts use honey and a lot of really tasty waves heck yeah so great let's do this we basically just takes some distillate so we got a bunch of CBD distillate here so basically four thousand milligrams of CBD is what we're working with yep and we mix agar into it and on the magnetic stirrer so agar is like a thickening agent right yeah it's like you know it keeps it more vegetarian so you're not using just regular gelatin I love those magnetic stirrer yeah they're cool we got AB organic kinky butter we will mix in the ghee and we'll give it a little more heat so now we have a good blend of our butter and Annapolis yep now we have some acacia honey and a little bit of sunflower lecithin what is the Leveson do it's an emulsifier so it helps everything bind together so into our ghee and our distillate we're gonna put a bunch of honey honey and then a little bit of that sunflower lecithin we like using sunflower because you can get non-gmo so now we just wait for this to warm up a bit and then that's our honey butter mix basically we mix that with a little bit of distilled water and agar once that's blended bring it to a quick boil let it cool and when it's at 120 degrees pull it up in a syringe and we drop it in the cold oil but as they go through to the bottom they'll cool they'll solidify we'll leave them in there for a minute pull them out of the oil so now we let them sit in there for a minute can I try one of these yeah grab one big guy you know honey smear mmm right yeah it's really Pleasant", "cy0r4zIdDMs": "[Music] hi friends trent the wizard here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out factory6cbd.com watch more of our videos this is trent the wizard with factory six factoids again we'll see you next time you", "J4wIX9obTbw": "[Music] foreign [Music] recently late actor ifan khan's wife made an appeal to legalize

forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "T9tIe981YFA": "chance the jury will take a

So it allows us to offer an alternative to that whole system, the DEA or Drug Enforcement Agency says it's currently in the process of reviewing the rules surrounding products like Delta eight THC, I'm not surprised because I warned everybody that. It really wasn't medicine for the very sick. It was the camel's nose under the tip, and we've not seen all that We're going to see, says Pull County Sheriff Grady Judd. It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health. Of your loved ones that's going to drive on the same highway with a person that takes enough of this low Delta eight to get stone. So it's not gonna be", "H_vVwcXn3Q0": "oh what's up easy bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "CuqkdDtrmmk": "you kind of grieve the child that you thought you would

anything without the help of a physician she says she supports medical marijuana but doesn't feel comfortable recommending it just yet it may be that it works with some that marijuana might work with some and not with others just like other medications we will certainly continue to watch the research we want to give out good information and we wanted information that we feel like we can trust but

all over America a new lease on life treating a wide array of conditions with exciting non-invasive options but is all CBD created equal with the passing of the 2018 farm bill it's allowed a lot of

themselves just hemp extract made from stock stems and seeds the problem with that is stock stems and seeds contain virtually no cannabinoids that's what you're buying the product for I do trust imbue

What's the truth about CBD oil for pain? If you are looking for\nany type of marijuana, cannabis, or insight\ntied to whether or not CBD oil is legal, I'll explain, the crazy sale coming right up. (upbeat music) CBD oil, medical marijuana, and more. Oh my. Great to be with you, hello. Little bit of, spray of that. Imagine that being able to ease your pain. If you've never seen me before, I'm the YouTube Deal Guy, Matt Granite. You might know me from your CBS, NBC, ABC TV stations, I also host\na show for Amazon Live, and I'm Canadian where the\nlegalities of marijuana have really not been\ndebated to the same extent in different countries or cities and, I don't have any type of\npolitical stance on anything. I hunt down deals. I'm here only to answer the question, does CBD oil for pain\nwork and is it legal? So, first things first,\nI'm just gonna make sure I got all my legal notes\nright up here, a reminder, that CBD oil from hemp\nis legal in the U.S., it is not psychoactive cannabinoid. That does not contain\ntetrahydrocannabinol, THC. Do I sound like an expert? No, I'm not. I'm a deal expert. In fact, I actually asked two experts to assist with today's\ndeal, including a doctor. But before we get to that, I have pain. Imagine, if you've ever\nused Bengay, or Icy Hot. Every time you have that\npain, you put it on, you get your hands covered,\nand then you have your, smell like aromatherapy\nfor the next five years, like peppermint extract. And with this beautiful\nbaby, who I've shown you in some videos, by the\nway, she's getting bigger. She weighs over 20 pounds\nnow at eight months, so just about twenty\npounds, and my back, neck, and shoulders are hurting more\nthan they have in the past. The concept of a spray\nthat could alleviate pain, is something that I wanna\nshow to you right now, in fact, there's a deal link for it, just expand the video\ndescription box right under me, and you will have your\nlink revealed to that. But before we get to why I like it, let's actually hear from two experts. I have Dr. Derek, who you\nmight have seen on TV, he's a USA Today contributor, and then Bruno Roder, who is, I believe, a physical therapist, and\nhe also works with people who live with pain across the country. - Pain relief, many people\nare in need of pain relief, possibly problems in the shoulders, the hips, the knees,\nthe back, or the neck. Now there is many ways\ntraditionally, to handle pain relief, many drug medications\nand surgical treatment could be very invasive,\nor some easier things, something newer more modern\nlike CBD oil is extremely effective and is gaining more credibility. Why? Because it gives you\nthe actual pain relief. On top of the fact, what\nI love about this kind is they mix it with magnesium. Now, magnesium, in case you're wondering, is a natural pain reliever, but also, it's a muscle relaxant,\nso it gets the muscles to relax before we get the\ninflammation and the pain out with the CBD oil. Very effective when used\nin conjunction with ice, and some other treatment as well. Take this, one or two\nsprays at the affected area. I love using it on my knees\nor my hands to get rid of some arthritis pain. Also too, I work with a lot of clients that might have pain in the\nlower back or in the knees. Very effective with that as well. And lastly, it smells delightful. You don't have to worry about\nit smelling like a medicine cabinet coming your way, so try this. One or two sprays to the affected area, and you'll be amazed at how fast it works, and how good you feel. - We all get sore. Whether we work out or not, we get sore. I've been turned on to a muscle\nspray that is so amazing. You spray it on, feels cool\nat first, then it warms up, goes right to the\nmuscles, no mess, no fuss, I even like the odor, it's amazing. - So why do I like it? If you have knee, shoulder, hand, foot, neck,\nor back, and hip pain, this unique spray design allows\nfor that clean application, as opposed to those creams, which I mentioned could get messy, and soil other items that you touch. This is also the only natural\nand safe modern extra strength pain relief, without a prescription. So the CBD, you get that pain relief, and the inflammation\nreducer, the magnesium, which is the muscle relaxant. And keep in mind that\nthis is the only product on the market that has both. Magnesium is a natural mineral salt extracted from the brine of the Dead Sea, which allows your muscles to relax. and then the CBD oil,\nobviously, the concentrations, are a natural yet powerful inflammation and swelling reliever. The peppermint oil will\nrefresh and relax your skin, and then the chamomile is\njust another botanical boost to soothe that tired skin. It really works. I've used Icy Hot, or I think it was usually\ncalled antiphygesia, I know they have different\nthings in different countries, but, I'm telling you right now, this is awesome. And despite all of the arguments about what should be\ntransported and made where, and what's in what product, I'm not here to debate any of that, only to tell you that\nthis really does work. And its legal. So that's great. If you do want to take\nadvantage of this item, obviously the company behind this is not paying me to say nice things about them, I'm not endorsing this, I'm\njust telling you that it works. And if you do talk to a chiropractor, physical therapist, or Doctor\nDerek, or another doctor, they can attest the fact\nthat the formulation of this product is beneficial. That's all I'm here to do, show you a deal on it. Click that video. Click that link below the\nvideo description box, I wonder if they had a spray\nto help you speak properly. That would be awesome. And you'll find what you're looking for. Thank you again for watching. The only reason I knew to hunt this down, was because subscribers\nrequested this product. I was actually getting a\nlot of requests for this. By the way, if you have\nnot yet subscribed to or listened to my Deal Guy podcast which is available to Spotify and iTunes, The Deal Guy podcast,\nfeel free to do that, because a lot of the\nlisteners will also chime in, so its like between YouTube subscribers, and podcast listeners,\nI'm rewarded on both sides by amazing insight because you guys all make me\nmuch better at my job.

Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower China already has the infrastructure and the know-how since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp that's mainly used for textiles and paper but here's the catch in China cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic junsu PCL ba you fool tryna shop that's because it contains not only CBD but THC the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high I feel very safe in my new outfits anyone caught selling products with THC risk spending the rest of his or her life in prison or worse face the death penalty and by extension CBD consumption in the country is also illegal so when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plans it actually felt like we were touring a prison here there are dozens of surveillance cameras barbed wire and every door is locked with a coat oh wow looks like a Star Wars control room in here but what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business and authorities aren't stifling that instead they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production will mention condom a girl who should say go onto the King Kong Shah Jahan I want to know do you have tests for your employees like drug tests taken I sure go on tea time away gg-get you're not so this apparently is CBD it's kind of muddy looking it kind of looks like a black bean paste or something this factory runs 24 hours a day seven days a week pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year so this is what the world wants pure CBD extract and the most pure CBD can be sold for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars per kilogram we went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell CBD Shanghai you have a dollar debt not sure rockefeller count all Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CII acts an American financial firm that analyzes companies in the US for Chinese investors when they looked at the CBD boom they decided to open a company in China one may watch other Hayashi be the to me my own son says to really win big it won't be about just selling to the US eventually he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country so Chinese entrepreneurs like son are starting to educate Chinese consumers he's selling CBD free products that are legal in China this influencer is testing one of sons products it contains other extracts from cannabis plants but he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD it doesn't have any CBD is that misleading jungle vine hemorrhage at all tension the PR DVD shriveled up see my logo for some beer [Music] as companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future - Oh Madonna Mia don't really match

3,000 years it only hasn't been a medicine in this country for 70 years I mean first of all I think just to talk about the the polarization of marijuana you know as a plan I think people have some ideas but people don't really understand like the journey so we tried to put in a little bit of history and context you know without it being like a big you know kind of write film it's not that kind of film but you know we put in the history so I think people are surprised to learn about that it's in the same schedule as LSD and you know that cocaine is in a less dangerous schedule and people are surprised to learn that the US government has a patent on the compounds in marijuana at the same time the US government is saying it has no medical value this is her cannabis oil regimen that we have right now we give her the size of about a half a grain of rice two times a day with baby food and in fact that it's actually at doing something with these can't with cancer on these children I mean we you know what we were able to follow from five years of making this film watching these subjects get better from this medicine not everyone not not everyone but yeah you know most of the kids and so it's it certainly is something that should people more people should know about and we're looking at this window I mean I think what's amazing when you really start learning about cannabis is honestly like how many people that could help I mean we're talking about like autism a DD Crohn's disease you know it's just this huge list of conditions we focus on pediatric and society we we focus on pediatric cancer because it's dramatic and also it's you know takes the stigma away it's not smoking joints and what people think you're really looking at you know medicinal properties but I think like we were amazed we went to Israel and we went to Jerusalem we went to like the top laboratories to look at the science because of course there are light years ahead of the us because they didn't have all the research blocks and you know it's fascinating to see like different strains killed different cancers but the same strain doesn't kill the same cancer and just the mechanism of how cannabis fights against cancers like super interesting so it's you know it's it's just this world of potential of healing and it's so criminal that it has been kept from us for 80 years there is some cell death the tumor is actually dying in certain areas there's no new growth I'm just thrilled this is the most amazing news we could have ever gotten", "prr6FLa61jk": "my name is Bob mosquito I'm

produce five to seven thousand bars a day you know these two machines behind us we're running 70 to 80 pounds of product through these machines every day in Colorado when we started six years ago inconsistency was the biggest problem in the edibles industry and nobody was really testing products nobody was accurately dosing products we saw that as a big opportunity not only to set ourselves apart but to do what was right for the patients people didn't really like edibles because they were afraid of them you could have an edible one day and you'd be medicated fine you'd have the same edible from the same company the following week and you'd be over medicated that was the biggest concern that we saw and you know my partner Rick his expertise was perfecting a recipe and duplicating at 20,000 times a day when I approached him and talked to him about doing edibles that we treated like food you know professionally packaged nutritional labels consistency those were the three main things that weren't happening in Colorado at the time so we saw that really as something that the industry needs you", "Q8XAXIZuKLU": "alright so the first product I'm here to show you today is some flour this is tangerine haze here and this would be one of the products that people would buy that is smoked or vaporize and we sell it by the week very popular somebody may use this particular strain and some people report that it's very uplifting good for the morning time to get your day started so everyone's experiences may vary what may work for one person may not necessarily work for the next but in my personal experience tangerine haze is really good because it uplifts mood gives me a clear head without getting anxiety so it's a good way that you can start off your morning one of my favorite parts about the bar is if you see here there is child resistant packaging so I actually have to squeeze both ends here and then and then to show you what the actual chocolate bar looks like on the inside and the really cool thing about this - which is important for the adult use regulation is for edibles the serving sizes cannot exceed 5 milligrams per serving and it cannot get more than 100 milligrams per package and each one of these pieces of chocolate here has our contains THC symbol with the little leaflet located right on the bottom and that is required to be on all so this consists of five pre-rolled joints so I'll show you the child resistant opening we got here and when we lift it up as you can see number 1 2 3 4 5 are your 5 joints and on the back which is the really cool part is it gives us testing information so we know how strong each individual joint is and how strong it will be and again like everything else we got our contains THC symbol on here so we got Moomins here which is another edible that you may purchase here at meta which is a strawberry gummy and just to kind of give you an idea of what they look like this is what they look like here and one thing you may or may not notice is on the actual edible itself and again it has that contains THC logo that's required to be on all of our edibles and our one person might choose to have a gummy is because they may not have dietary restrictions and they prefer gummies say choc over chocolate so this could be another way to medicate but just keep in mind that all edibles work the same so go low and slow and wait a couple hours before you begin pretty simply it is a vaporizer that works similarly the smoking step to a Down of the carcinogens that happen with combustion so with this this is a great way to get medication that if you need to be more discreet or anything along those lines and the one thing I like about this is for people who may have hand dexterity issues there's no assembly required you simply just your inhale will trigger the battery and then you go from there so one thing to keep in mind about the apex one is it's made with our distillate oil which happens to be the most pure and potent in the store so I may not recommend this to somebody who's starting off or if they are trying it too definitely again go low and slow and try it in a safe space to see how it makes you feel so the lotion is really good for localized pain relief myself I had a lot of back issues so I will put the lotion after a hot shower my pores tend to be open more so the medicine gets absorbed and it really helps with the inflammation and loosening my back up in that particular area and one thing to note is that most people report with topicals it's a non-psychoactive so a lot of people could use the lotion and go about their daily lives doing the activities they want without necessarily the psychoactive so for the lotion in particularly for most things I would say start with a couple pumps but definitely depending on the pain will determine how much lotion you're gonna want to use now elevation oil is a grapeseed / NCT cooking oil now you could use to add to all the recipes that you'd like I know some people use it for salad dressings some people just take it in the TSP and eat it and some people even use it as a topical application but the really cool part about this is it's dosed out by the TSP and for those who have dietary restrictions this could be a really good option for those who are looking for an alternative to a tables is a singular pre-roll that we sell here so you do not necessarily have to buy in the packs you could buy it by the pre-roll and this is about how big they are and what they look like so people can either have the choice to buy the loose flower like tangerine haze and roll it themselves or if they wish that it rolls for them for any reason so the next product that I'm going to show you is what we would like to call shattered now a little disclaimer with shatter it tends to be a bit potent so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for somebody who's starting off with cannabis but just to show you why it's called shatter shatter is a butane hash oil that is then purged off the butane to give it a glass like translucent appearance so this is something that you so those who are inexperienced I might stay away but if you do again have a greener right sized piece and the Colorado middle some people tend to be more used to more regimented medicine meaning taking it at certain times in the day so we tend to make this a little bit easier for them and then also again with dietary restrictions this should be another great edible for people to try", "WGS5bSNAqcQ": "- My name's Leah Campbell, and I'm a 36 year old\nwriter and single mom. I microdose marijuana to\ntreat pain and anxiety, and I have no problem admitting\nthat makes me a better mom. I do want to preface this by saying that I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not in a position\nto advise anyone else on how medicinal marijuana may help them or make their lives better. I can only talk about\nmy personal experiences. I have stage four endometriosis, which is a chronic pain condition. It started about 10 years ago. I've had five major abdominal surgeries. Pain has been kind of a constant in my life for the last decade. As a single mom to a six\nyear old, that's hard, especially when my period\nhits and I'm stuck in bed. - Hello.\n(laughing) - What's your name? - Josie. - Josie, who are you? Are you my daughter? - Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. - Are you my best bud? I was not the person anyone\nwould have ever expected to be advocating for\nmedicinal marijuana use. I grew up in a family of police officers. My father was a narcotics officer for many, many years of my childhood. My whole life I've heard\nthat drugs are bad. I was 25 years old before I\ntried it for the first time and honestly, I hated it. Smoking marijuana made\nme wanna sit in a corner and not talk to anyone, which isn't a great thing for an introvert who already kind of is drawn that way. And I was pretty sure marijuana\nwould never be for me. So when a friend suggested\nI try microdosing, I was pretty against it, but I happened to be\nvisiting her in Seattle for another friend's wedding\nwhen my period started. And it kind of seemed like my period was about to ruin what should\nhave been a really fun time with people I cared about. So we went to a pot shop, and we discussed all the options and I bought a couple of mints that came in really low doses, and I followed the instructions\nof the employee there, to basically do no more than about two milligrams\nevery one to two hours. For most people getting high\non a medicinal marijuana edible would take five to 10 milligrams. So I was taking much smaller doses. I found that it really did\ntake the edge off the pain, especially the cumulative effect. So it didn't necessarily\nkick in right away after the first pill, but as I continued going\nthroughout the day, I was able to be more and more functional without really being high. And that was the key point to me, was that something was\ntaking the pain away without taking me out of commission. When I got home to Alaska,\nI started experimenting with marijuana more and more, and I kinda found that my ideal dose is about 1.5 milligrams,\nagain, every one to two hours depending on how bad my pain is. But another benefit came out as well, and that was that I started to realize the anxiety I've dealt with my entire life was leveling off on the days\nthat I was microdosing as well. And that was huge. You know, as much as pain\ncan knock me out of my life, anxiety can as well. If I'm having a high stress day or I'm just not in the right head space, I have a hard time working. I have a hard time being\nthe friend I wanna be, the mom I wanna be. What is that? - My tooth fell out.\n- Yeah. - [Leah] Can I see your mouth? Did it hurt very bad or\njust a little bit bad? - Just a little. - [Leah] You pretty brave? - Yeah. - So for me a bad pain day\noften means being stuck in bed, which is hard as a single\nmom to a six year old who wants to be going\nout and doing things. It's not really fair to her either. She can sit in bed with me\nall day and watch movies, but why should she have to? I do a lot of things to manage my pain. Marijuana is really just one tool in a great big bucket of tools I have. But in terms of pain\nmanagement in the moment, microdosing helps me, not\nmore than anything else, because honestly, prescription\npain killers I've been given knock out the pain better, but marijuana helps to\ntake the edge off the pain while still allowing me to be functional, whereas the prescription\npain killers I've been given knock me out too and, as a mom, that's not an acceptable solution. So these are some of the products I use. These are really small mints, and the thing I like about these is they come in the small doses I prefer. It's like 1.6 milligrams a mint, which is usually my preferred dosage. So this is my favorite product. I also buy chocolate bars. These chocolate bars come in 5\nmilligram dosages per square. The thing I like about this is I can get even smaller doses if I want, just because I can take a small bite and I could break one of these squares up into five or six pieces if I wanted. All of these are kept in my freezer, in a special box that my kiddo\nknows is mommy's medicine. We've talked about it\nand discussed the fact that these look like candy,\nbut that they're not. Hey Josie. Oh, did you just wake up? Thank you for joining\nus, little sleepy head. (laughing) Can I ask you a question? What are these things? - Mommy medicine. - And are you ever supposed\nto touch any of this? No, how come? - Because.\n- Cause it's not for kids? Love you.\n(lips smacking) I think at the end of the day, we're all kind of just trying to survive and that may be especially\ntrue for those of us with chronic pain conditions or mental health struggles. We just wanna be the best\nversions of ourselves. For me, microdosing helps me to be the best version of myself. After years of trying\njust about every solution and every option available, it's one of the best that I've found, and like I said before, it's just one tool in my toolbox, but yeah,\nit makes me a better mom because it helps me to get\nout of bed in the morning when I'm having a bad pain day, and it helps me to clear my head when my anxiety is spinning me out. It gives my child the version\nof me that she deserves, a mom who is functional and happy and able to get through the day. I think a lot of people take for granted that not everybody has that\nwithout the additional help. Whether I were taking a\nprescription medication or this medication that I'm\nable to buy at the store, shouldn't matter. It's something that helps. It's something that gives me\nthe version of me I wanna be. It allows me to have relief and it gives my daughter\nthe mom she deserves. (gentle music)", "J42pmHV8ZEk": "Transcriber: Almudena Torrecilla\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs When I was 33 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And like so many who've gone before me, that diagnosis changed my life. It changed the way I look at the world. And it led me to two very common questions that one starts to ask when diagnosed\nwith a life-threathening illness. How did this happen? And what do I do now? Now this isn't a story\nabout self blame. These are just common\nand natural questions that come from many in times like these. I actually found the questions empowering. This is actually a story about how those\ntwo questions led to a realization that I think can help\nto change the conversation around what means to be and stay healthy. So back to my first question: how did this happen? See, (Sigh) I felt like I had done\neverything right. What do I mean by that? Well, if I ask you, what does\nit mean to be healthy, to live a healthy lifestyle? What kind of answers do you get? Regular exercise? Balanced diet? Taking your vitamins? Annual checkups? Limiting toxic exposure to chemicals,\npersonal care products? Well, by all of these\naccounts, I was healthy. I had done the work. So I was angry, and I was frustrated that I'd followed the rules\nand I still found myself sick. Now, I had a friend \nwho a few years earlier had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And when it came to being healthy, she put everyone I know to shame. So I knew she would understand\nhow I was feeling. When we got together, \nshe told me something that would eventually change the way \nI think about health. She told me that her journey \nhad taken her to a place where she believed whole-heartedly  that she had not in fact \nbeen truly healthy. Not at a whole person level because \nshe'd overlooked taking care of herself at the level of her thoughts \nand her emotions. So what she was saying \nhad some subjective merit to me because I can relate to suppressing\nmy own thoughts and emotions maybe in order to please others, or taking on the stress\nof trying to juggle a thousand things. But then the pragmatist in me just wanted to brush that off\nas a little too woo-woo. Then again I had, you know, tackled all of these. And here she was standing\nright in front of me, the picture of health and vitality. So what could it hurt\nto look into this a little further? So down I went through\nrabbit hole number one: mind-body medicine. And for those who of you don't know, mind-body medicine\nstudies how our mind, mood, thoughts and emotion affect our body. So that would be things like \nstress management, stress reduction, like going for a walk in nature, \nunplugging from technology, getting a massage, meditation, (Sigh) mindful breath-work, and thought and belief awareness. So this would be something as simple\nas being more mindful of our thoughts, or something more concrete \nlike cognitive behavioral therapy, where you become actively aware\nof your thoughts and behaviors and then replace them\nwith more positive alternatives that in turn elicit\nmore positive emotions. I also started delving into stories that highlight the mind's ability\nto affect the body. Like the peer-reviewed account\ndocumented by Dr. Klockner in 1959 about a man who he called Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright was diagnosed\nwith terminal cancer and given only days to live. With tumors the size of oranges \nhe had heard or a horse serum that was said to be effective\nagainst cancer and he begged to receive it. His physician, Dr. Philip West,\nreluctantly agreed but was astonished to find\nless than a week later his patient was out of his death bed \nand joking with his nurses. Now, this went on for months until Mr. Wright read a newspaper article stating that the serum was a quack remedy and he suffered an immediate relapse. Now, Dr. West, testing out a hypothesis, said: \"Well, don't believe everything\nyou read in the papers,\" and then he proceeded\nto inject him with what he said was a super-refined, double-strength\nversion of the drug. Really it was water. \nBut again, the tumors melted away. Mr. Wright was the picture of health\nand vitality for another two months until he read what he felt\nwas a definitive report stating that the serum was worthless, \nand he died days later. Now, this is just one of thousands\nand thousands of examples that highlight how the mind\ncan affect the body. And, so I had my anecdotal evidence, which\nincluded the example of my own friend, and I'd like to say that I took\nwhat I learned and put it into practice and lived happily ever after. Of course, that's not what happened. And I don't think I'm alone in that, because many of us hear about how stress\nand emotions can affect our health and how mindfulness meditation\ncan make a difference in our lives and all of that, but many of us also \ndon't do anything about it. I had the stories and the theories, but what I really needed\nwas hard evidence, science to prove that it was true. I mean, we've all grown up\nin a world of, you know, Newtonian, science-based thinking, meaning if we can't see it\nor measure it, then it's not real. So I, like maybe, maybe many of you, didn't start to put these ideas\ninto practice just yet. What I did, and this is now getting into \nthe second of the two questions that I alluded to earlier,\nthe \"What do I do now?\". What I did is I started using\nmedical cannabis at the recommendation\nof my nurse and other patients. And it helped immensely with pain \nand nausea and anxiety and all of the really fun staff\nthat come along with cancer treatment. I also started joining online\nmedical cannabis user communities. And I was in awe at the spectrum of issues\nthat cannabis was helping with. Intractable illnesses that weren't\nresponding to other forms of treatment, like MS, fibromyalgia, PTSD,\nTourette syndrome, IBS, epilepsy, chronic pain, autoimmune\ndiseases ... I could keep going. The list goes on. But I started to wonder, how was it\nthat cannabis was helping with all of these unrelated conditions, because I can't think of another\nmedication out there that would be able to help \nwith so many illnesses. So how did it work? Well, down I went\nthrough rabbit hole number two, and this was a deep hole. In a nutshell, I learned that the reason that cannabis was working \nfor so many different conditions is because it interacts directly with \nour body's own endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is\na little known but massive bodily system responsible for maintaining homeostasis,\nthat's balance, in the body. It consists of a network of \nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids as well as receptor sites, the most well-known being the CB1 and CB2\nreceptors, and enzymes. Think of it kind of like\nthe traffic lights of a city, keeping the streets moving smoothly. But if a light goes out anywhere,\nit will cause problems. Congestion, confusion. Cars and people will keep moving, \nbut without the guidance and the rules, the flow just won't be as efficient \nand far more susceptible to accidents. It's actually been called the most\nprolific and integrative system in human health and homeostasis, and even dubbed\nour body's own master system because of its role in maintaining balance\namong all the other systems of the body. Now, this is important because all illness\ncan in fact essentially be boiled down to some sort of imbalance in the body, whether genetically induced or otherwise. Now, if you haven't heard of this system\nbefore, you're not alone. And if you are hearing about it \nfor the first time, you may be wondering why on earth you haven't heard of this\nepically important system until now. And it's partly because it's newly\ndiscovered in around the 1980s, but also partly because\nof the stigma around cannabis, for which the system is named. Because scientists discovered the system when they were trying to answer\nthat same question: \"how does cannabis work?\" So they learned that compounds in the\ncannabis plant called phytocannabinoids actually fit near perfectly\nwith the receptor sites of the endocannabinoid system. So used properly, this plant\ncan help to activate, tone and support the endocannabinoid\nsystem when it's out of balance. So it's a pretty amazing plant. To say I became obsessed with\ncannabis and the endocannabinoid system is an understatement. I buried myself in research papers,\nlectures, courses, certifications, learning everything I could about cannabis as well as ways to keep\nthe endocananbinoid system itself healthy and balanced. Because while it's easy to say, \"wow, look at this amazing\nplant that we have; it's able to help\nwith all these chronic conditions and balance the body,\" and obviously I believe that; I've dedicated part of my life\nto spreading the message that cannabis is medicine. But it's equally important\nto look beyond cannabis as a single cure. Because when you look closer, you'll see\nthat cannabis is an important ally, but it's only part of the puzzle. So, let's use that example again\nas the endocannabinoid system and the traffic lights. Except for in this scenario, cannabis\nis like the friendly police officer that comes in to direct traffic\nwhen the lights are out. So the officer's doing their best, and certainly it's helping to keep traffic\nmoving in a more organized manner, but we still have to figure out\nor at least try to figure out how to fix the lights. So how do we go about fixing the lights? How do we support and heal\nthe endocannabinoid system when it's out of balance? Well, it just so happens\nthat one review study in particular looked at 325 other studies that all focused on what helped\nand hindered the endocannabinoid system by focusing on key\nendocannabinoid health factors, and here's what they learned\ndirectly affect the system. Exercise, and notice I wrote\n\"Pleasurable Exercise\" there - it has to be something\nthat you enjoy doing. Okay? Diet and supplements.\nSo a couple examples that I'll give you. Herbs and spices contain\nsmall amounts of phytocannabinoids, the same compound that cannabis contains. And certain healthy fats can actually\nhelp your body to synthesize its own endocannabinoids. Environmental exposures. So some pesticides will actually\ndownregulate the endocannabinoid system, have a direct effect with it. There are a few others\nI'm going to share with you. But before I do, I just want to bring\nyour attention to a sentence that really jumped out at me\nwhen I was reading this study. It said that the endocannabinoid system represents a microcosm\nof psychoneuroimmunology. And I had to look that last word up. In case some of you don't know,\nI'm going to break it down. Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of the interaction\nbetween the psychological processes, \"the mind,\" and the systems\nof the body, \"the body.\" So really it's just a fancy way of saying\nthat metaphorically speaking, the endocannabinoid system represents\na microcosm of mind-body medicine. So now hopefully you can see\nwhere this is all coming full circle and coming together, I hope. Because here's what else was shown\nto affect the endocannabinoid system: Chronic stress. So they looked at stress from pain as well as stress\nfrom thoughts and emotions, so repeated feelings\nlike anger, guilt, depression - something that is chronic\nmeans more long-term. That was shown to significantly impact\nthe endocannabinoid system. And activities that elicit \nthe relaxation response. So that would be, again,\nkind of that walk in nature or doing some yoga, getting a massage. They consider osteopathic\nmanipulation in that study. So why does this matter? Well, I said before that we live\nin a physical world, so for many of us if we can't see it\nand measure it, then it's not real. I told about how I had heard stories\nabout how the mind can affect the body, but I still didn't give it the same weight\nthat I would give to nutrition and movement and medicine. But when I understood\nthat my own endocannabinoid system, my master system for maintaining\nhealth and homeostasis, required me to start taking care\nof my thoughts, my emotions, my stress, my beliefs, it finally clicked for me. So I want to leave you\nwith a scenario to imagine, an idea of how this information can help\nto change the conversation around health, like I said in the beginning. Imagine if the message that we heard from\nour physicians and public health officials sounded like this: \"Listen, what if I told you that there's\nthis really important bodily system, call it a master system, and if you can keep it functioning well, it can do wonders in allowing your body\nto innately keep itself healthy, heal itself and improve the quality of life for those\nwith biological and genetic illnesses.\" If I told you there was\na system like that, would you want to know\nhow to keep it strong and healthy? And I think most would answer yes to that. And then they would go on to say, \"Great, \nso think of this system like a stool. Each of the legs represents\nall that's required to keep the system functioning well. And here's why we compare it to a stool. Each of those legs is an integral part\nof keeping that stool stable and balanced. If we remove a leg, or even shorten a leg,\nthe whole stool starts to wobble and becomes less efficient,\nless stable, less balanced. So let's design a plan for you\nthat incorporates all of these concepts as part of a healthy lifestyle.\" Imagine. Not only is that proactive,\nbut it's empowering. And I invite all of you to consider\nwhere your stool is wobbling. It's been said that mindfulness could be\nthe next great public health revolution. I believe it's only a matter of time\nbefore mindfulness, stress reduction, thought-belief awareness is every bit\nas important as seeing your doctor, taking your vitamins, eating a balanced\ndiet and getting regular exercise. And maybe the endocannabinoid system\ncan help to catalyze that. It's my hope that the more we understand\nthe ramifications of this master system, the more we'd be willing to develop\na truly integrated approach to whole personal health. Who would have thought\nthat cannabis, the gateway drug, could actually form part of the gateway to\nthe next great public health revolution? Thank you.

that smoking pot drastically increases your risk of stroke let's see what sources like healthcare triage think about that too the research the study we're talking about today published in the journal stroke reports that marijuana users between 18 and 44 years of age have significantly higher odds of having a stroke than non users using data from a national survey collected by the CDC the authors concluded that recent marijuana users were 82 percent more likely to have a stroke while the risk of more frequent users defined as those smoking 10 or more days per month went up to almost a hundred fifty percent come on a lot of people smoke pot if those between the ages of 18 and 44 were really a grave danger of stroke don't you think we'd be seeing a lot more strokes in this age group feels like I've mentioned relative versus absolute risk you know once or twice but here I go again 80 to 150 percent are the relative risks and since absolute risk is way more applicable in real life that's what we should talk about relatively risky over on Twitter took the time to figure this out for a lot of studies sensationalizing the news including this one and according to his calculations the absolute risk increase of stroke for frequent pot smokers is point five percent zero point five percent we've covered what we know about marijuana use before we did not specifically mention stroke risk in those videos mostly because there's not much evidence to justify it there just aren't a lot of non case control studies focusing on stroke and marijuana use the few that do exist suffer from the same problems mentioned here along with the fact that it can be pretty hard to get honest self reporting of marijuana consumption which is what all these surveys rely on and finally the studies that do exist contradict each other some studies like this one report an association between marijuana use and stroke another study analyzing only male data reported no association between those two factors the current study reported higher use for frequent marijuana users that also reported cigarettes and as the author's point out in their discussion other studies do not report an association between marijuana and stroke once cigarette and alcohol use have been adjusted for so all we can do for now is remind you of what we've said before the level of harm currently associated with marijuana is much less scary than that of other things like cigarettes or alcohol it's likely real meaning greater than zero so take that into account but don't panic we can always use more data especially with changing marijuana laws and more and more people use it and we'd probably need it to be better data especially for it to be newsworthy hey did you like this episode you might enjoy

video as you guys can tell i am going to be doing another cooking with cannabis video and today i am going to be using ghirardelli caramel turtle premium brownie mix so it's gonna be very basic y'all obviously i'm just gonna be mixing the cannabis butter with that which i have right here and this has a thousand milligrams of chc and six milligrams of cbd per packaging and it has 100 servings within this so i'm really excited to be trying it out with a brownie in my last cooking with cannabis video i did a seafood mukbang and i mixed it in there and it was really good and a lot of you guys wanted to know like how did it go did i get high did i not and y'all right after that video i went straight to sleep and i woke up feeling like like i had the best sleep of my life so i'm really excited to try this today my first ever edible that i had was a brownie i feel like that's pretty standard for most people but let me know what you guys have had like what was your first ever edible that you've ever tried put it in the comment section below and if you guys want to see me make this then go ahead and keep on watching okay so i got all the ingredients here make sure that you guys if you guys are making this then obviously the instructions will be on the back if you guys are making anything else then just make sure you follow the normal guidelines um i'm going to be using just this um butter infused cannabis that i got from my local cannabis store and if you guys see my last video you've seen that i portion these out it's kind of cold so let me take it out and show you so what i did with my can of butter is if you guys can see they're cut into like little triangles right because my thought is is since i don't know how to portion you know what it is i basically just looked at the um box here and it says 100 servings per container so i cut it into um so many different triangles and then i use one so for example this one based on my math calculations is about 12 servings right so that's how i do it so i'm basically about to put in 12 servings into my brownies so obviously if you want one serving then now i know to cut my brownies into 12 pieces and that will do the damn thing so that's what we're going to do so that's how i portioned mine out let me know how you guys portion yours i don't know i just kind of did it like that just so i can have a better gauge and make it pretty potent so i'm going to just go ahead and stick with that and then next time around if i need more then i'm going to maybe make the triangles bigger next what you're going to do is whip it so that's it that is my mix the main reason why i'm trying to make edibles more you guys is because i'm actually um gonna try to like cut back a little bit on smoking i just i'm not i'm gonna cut back just a little bit you know just test it out but i haven't really had good experiences with edibles every time i do an edible i go crazy like i'm literally like on the toilet okay so fun fact y'all i don't even really like chocolate but i like brownies y'all like that and don't even trip y'all talking about cross contamination i'm gonna be the only one eating these and my husband and he knows he knows the vibes so don't worry about me licking the spoon and using it not sharing it's only mine okay so i got it all up in my pan and i'm going to just even it out and that's it you guys oh i almost forgot the caramel so it comes with caramel because y'all know it got that caramel drizzle i also want to do candies and when i say candies i just want to um like get the little mold and then make gummy candies so that when i'm on the go you know i can just do that so stay tuned but i had to bring it back to a brownie because that's like like edible 101 everybody has a brownie with an edible about to show you how this i actually got some let me hide off the mix all right there we go okay i'm gonna bake this in the oven for however long it says and then i'll be right back okay so it is all done the only thing i will say is on the like i had a few spots where i like dropped a hella caramel and as you can see it made it like a hole so next time i wish i i could do like more better swirls but this is it i'm about to cut it up and portion it okay so i cut them in 12 like i said each is a serving so this right here is one serving it looks hella big huh but i figure it's got to be right so i'm about to eat this whole thing and then i'm gonna give this one to my husband because i need another guinea pig to try one also let's try it cheers that's good but it's something strong at all i don't i don't taste the weed but that's what i said yeah last time when i ate the butter i was like i didn't think it was strong but and if my calculations are right this is one serving i can kind of taste it now yeah a little bit um it's good though so we're gonna see like i said i'm gonna eat this whole thing so we're gonna see if it what it does how i feel i'm gonna give it like 30 minutes and i just ate it real quick so you", "AZynhX-qcc4": "it's been a nice two hours of high getting a little bit progressively stronger i'm back you guys i hope you missed me i'm finally moved into the new home i'm so excited to be here expect to see videos from me regularly again now that i've moved in i have no excuse if you're not already subscribed make sure you subscribe right now so you can see all my new videos in your sub box but today isn't going to be my typical smoking video i'm going to do something a little different i have 500 milligrams of rso capsules in here there are 10 capsules and they're 50 milligrams each actually looking at this many pills is pretty intimidating i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty much just going to film the aftermath of this so i hope you guys enjoy that this is a little bit of a different video for me but i think this is going to be a lot of fun got a nice tough glass of water to wash these down here's number one here's number two here's number three number four this is the point in our return at this point i'm getting [ __ ] lit number five all right halfway there number six i'm so scared my body like didn't want to swallow that one it was like dude don't do it i'm gonna start a timer right now before i forget so we can tell how long it takes for this to actually kick in i've never actually consumed rso before so i have no idea and i'm stone sober right now so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right number seven number eight number nine and last but not least number ten the point of no return wish me luck you guys this is gonna be a long day well it has been an entire minute and i'm not high at all yet i can confirm that honestly i'm a little nervous i've read online that rso can take up to 15 hours to kick in i don't think it's gonna take me that long but that's some of my brief googling told me and before this kicks in i'll explain to you what rso is for those of you who don't know it stands for rick simpson oil it's a cannabis extract but it's not meant to be dabbed like most cannabis extracts let me reiterate please do not dab this it tastes like [ __ ] it is not a fun experience it's much better to be consumed orally like through a pill or through some food it really doesn't have a nice consistency to it or taste so honestly the pill form that i just did is the best way to consume it so you don't have any of that weird flavor rso offers a lot of medical benefits when you're doing what i'm doing not really but it actually does especially for people who can't smoke but as i said this was a super [ __ ] high dose so i'm really curious about what's gonna happen to me i'm really not a huge edible guy like i said even when i've done 150 and 250 milligrams i really just don't enjoy the high i get so i'm really curious what this 500 milligram high is going to be like all right guys we just passed the 45 minute mark and i'm still not high i feel like this is gonna take as long as an edible to kick in so within the next 45 minutes i'm expecting to feel pretty rocked i was just going through my snapchats and somebody messaged me though and said that it took four hours for theirs to kick in so i'm really hoping i don't have to sit here for four hours waiting for this to kick in straight up it has been over an hour and a half and i'm really not that high like i might feel a little something but i honestly think it's all in my own head ultimately i don't think i'm high yet i hope this isn't a fail because i'm gonna be really pissed if this bottle just does nothing to me there's the stats for you as you can see 500 milligrams pack of 10 thc terpenes all that all right let's kick it oh my god i feel like edibles here you're talking [ __ ] bro it's starting to kick in i can like start to feel it in my chest and in my head a little bit it hasn't hit me like a brick yet i just thought this is gonna hit me way harder it's definitely a gradual high i'm actually feeling now it straight up took two hours and 13 minutes for me to feel anything but i'm feeling pretty hopeful right now finally my eyes are getting pretty heavy my whole body's getting that like slow feeling that you get on edibles so i have a feeling it's about to kick in all right well i'm bored i'm gonna go play with my dog or something paper paper high piper you're a dog dog oh my god you're a dog oh my god come here i'm so high oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm piper sit high five oh i'm too high yeah shake my hand good job piper you guys want to see something kind of funny my dog is an overbite i honestly feel like i'm just melting at this point like oh my god these edibles kicked in pretty strong my entire body just feels heavy i'm gonna try to catch a quick dub on fall guys let's see how this goes bruh i've never felt like i've been running this low in this game i think like time's been slower for me no bruh bruh right i got this i can do this i can do this i can do this oh yes i'm going to qualify let's [ __ ] go bro i'm in like the top three right now [ __ ] okay that [ __ ] me [ __ ] let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah [ __ ] i was gonna be the next one all right [ __ ] this game i need to just like listen to music it's kind of like vibe and [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] i need more water i'm so [ __ ] thirsty if you have the option to get crushed ice and you don't just don't text me back anymore because we're not friends that makes a [ __ ] mess all right let's hydrate before we die drink oh my god that was like the kiss of life all right as you can see we are approaching the four hour point and as you can see my eyes are very heavy i'm not gonna lie man i'm getting higher and higher and higher which is cool i guess but do you really want to pop some rso caps and have to be like still getting higher in four hours like maybe at like certain situations but ultimately dabbing and smoking weed are still my preferred ways to consume cannabis but yeah these aren't so cascade hidden i don't know what it is but i have like a little double vision right now i'm like super foggy it's a different type of high for sure it's definitely more like a foggier body high than like a typical dab high or a typical weed high which more focuses on like the head i feel like this is mainly the body and then like the head is secondary like the head high is there but the body height is so intense that you don't even really notice the head high almost but i think i need a nap like that's not out of their own possibility for me today i'm so [ __ ] high i was really worried like i was talking a lot of [ __ ] on these for a minute there like it was two and a half hours before i really felt anything and it's been another hour and a half and i'm so much higher than i was then so i'm curious when this is gonna like cap so it's gonna be a long day you guys i hope you're down for the ride i'm sorry if this video isn't interesting i know i'm typically smoking and [ __ ] more but i'm just riding this high out dude like this is [ __ ] nuts i low-key just want to keep smoking on top of this to see what happens kind of see if it evens out the head high with the body height a little bit but i don't know if that's the wisest idea but i'm not here to make wise decisions that's nice it's [ __ ] nice i just stabbed on some white widow from calypso big fan of their concentrates they're a little bit on the more expensive side but the terpene profile is just unreal that dab actually made me feel a little bit better i feel like the body height was just too intense now that i got a nice little head high there too i'm like all right all right i'm back in this how long has it been oh how about that 420 blazing four and a half hours in and i'm still feeling very [ __ ] good the cotton mouth is just not going away no matter how much water i drink it just will not stop she's gotta pee and then we're gonna make some wings in the airfryer popcorn turns to food porn the other side hope you are liking this [ __ ] high as [ __ ] home style vlog because this is what you're getting hope you missed me now we are going to turn the air dude do you hear me i'm so [ __ ] big we're gonna turn the airfryer on um boom if you smoke weed and do not have an air fryer i really hope that you can take one thing out of this video and go buy one because it will truly save your life especially when you're high and you want some fire food now we're just gonna drop them in and oh yeah those are done all right food porn is in full effect you guys i'm so [ __ ] high let's determine how one of these is that looks fire oh yeah i think these need some buffalo sauce all right my high i should not have used hot sauce because my dumbass spilled it all over my shirt but i found one that's pretty much the same color to keep the aesthetic piper's pissed off she didn't get any chicken wings saved a couple for later but i honestly think i hit the peak of this high you guys it's really not as bad as i thought it was gonna be for some reason i just thought it was gonna be super intense i've had a lot of 100 to 200 milligram doses before but this is the first time i ever had a 500 milligram dose and for some reason i just figured it was gonna be like two or three times the intensity but i honestly don't think it is i think there's like a peak high you get when you smoke and probably even with edibles and probably just with how much i consume cannabis right now my tolerance is so high that this just wasn't too intense for me like i definitely couldn't drive or anything and i definitely wouldn't recommend anyone try consuming this much you should definitely ask your doctor before consuming any amount of thc don't ask me and don't go off my uh experience probably should have said that earlier in the video but yeah i'm really just [ __ ] tired at this point i'm high as [ __ ] i feel like i've had like all the phases of the edible at this point i feel like i had the giggles i feel like i had the like just chill high part i feel like i had the munchies and now i'm just at the like chill slumped part of the edible like i'm exhausted that's really all i have to say right now i'm gonna have a good night's sleep i'm pretty sure i just confirmed you can't overdose on weed we've been doing this just under six hours and ten minutes it'll be six hours but you know the high only kicked in three and a half hours ago if i did my math right but still being high as [ __ ] three and a half hours later that's not too bad i still don't think that this is the way i would like to consume most of the time like i feel like this is really just for people that can't smoke or like really just don't want to for whatever reason but like this just isn't as fun for me because i hate waiting for the high i like it to just come pretty much instantly it probably will come out quicker if you have a low tolerance but that's not the situation for me you know you really just don't know what how you're gonna get and i'd rather like find out right away when i rip a bong if it like got me high or not then like find out four hours later if you got high or not you know i'm just kind of rambling at this point you guys but that's the video click like if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it make sure you subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way in my lovely new house with my adorable little pup leave a comment let me know what's the biggest edible you've ever had i'd like to know but it's time i take a nap thank you guys so much for watching i'm glad to be back on youtube i've missed you guys many more videos to come just you wait but my name is jeff peace", "CE3fqopiTBQ": "remember when cannabis was simple it meant marijuana pot THC drafts or weed it's getting complicated we're bombarded with CBD cannabidiol it's seemingly everywhere from medicines to supplements to foods and beauty products so what exactly is CBD and why is it different from THC used to get high let's make it simple CBD or cannabidiol is just one of about a hundred and fifty different bio chemicals called phyto cannabinoids that have so far been identified in cannabis plants the bio chemical is considered non psychoactive in other words consuming it doesn't get you high THC or tetrahydrocannabinol comes from a separate phyto cannabinoid THC a alone THC a produces no psychoactive effect but it converts to psychoactive THC when exposed to certain conditions of light oxygen and heat cannabis plants come in different shapes sizes Heights and widths and despite claims of multiple species only one exists it's called cannabis sativa it's the species to which both marijuana and hemp belong what makes the plants different among other things is concentration of CBD and THC a 99% of marijuana plants have THC a concentration between 2.5 and 22% hemp typically has THC a concentration of 0.3% or less marijuana CBD ranges between 0.1 and 12% hemp CBD Falls around 3.5% and can be bred for levels reaching as high as 20% the actual effects of cannabinoids including CBD are being studied for therapeutic use though research is still in its infancy non-psychoactive cannabinoid CBG is a suspected sleep aid CBC is a potential sedative there's also THC V and CBN both are psychoactive and suspected pain relievers what is known is that phyto cannabinoids bind to central nervous system receptors there's cb1 found primarily in the brain and cb2 found primarily in the immune system THC is especially adept at binding to cb1 brain receptors that edit non-essential memories to protect the brain from overload for example memories of what fellow commuters were wearing on your way to work these receptors tell your neurons to lie low it's that disconnect that THC seizes upon to make you feel relaxed and high but what about CBD does it calm inflammation relieve pain reduce anxiety does it belong in your morning latte the truth is detailed molecular effects of cannabinoids are unknown and research is somewhat crippled so far the FDA has approved only one CBD drug it's derived from marijuana and used to treat seizures while the 2018 farm bill decriminalized hemp marijuana research remains stifled because federally it's still classified as an illegal controlled substance it's for these reasons that researchers caution cannabinoids are part of a new frontier with potential to treat ailments from anxiety to migraines PTSD stroke and blood pressure maybe even turn back the clock so remember when cannabis was simple [Music]", "pc9arCO5UDw": "[Music] hey guys welcome to the hot box it's a little stray my boy will today we got another dope ass video as usual [ __ ] stoney patch kids this [ __ ] gonna be [ __

today to talk to you about the legalization of marijuana and the use of CBD oils with recent changes in legislation in regards to the use of marijuana there's a lot of misconceptions going around that because it is legal on the state level for recreational or medicinal use that it is okay for professional drivers to use however that is not the case since you operate at a federally regulated industry the federal regulations supersede the state regulations and it is in fact illegal for you to use it doesn't matter if you have a prescription or even in your off-duty time it's still illegal in regards to the CBD oil there's a lot of companies out there that are speculating that they contain no THC or they contain the point zero three percent of the maximum allowed however since they are not FDA approved there is no government oversight to guarantee that those standards are met since there is no guarantee on those standards there is no guarantees that you won't test positive on a drug screen I've done a lot of research on these companies and have noticed some similarities in them they all have disclaimers on their website stating that you know if you're in a federally regulated industry or you're subject to drug and drug testing not to use their product or use their product at your own risk you know when your CDL and your livelihood is on the line that's a huge risk to take

welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "NtGmqEIz9to": "[Music] another review and today I'm doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "mPfFk3qu8Qo": "Tripp keber is making a big bet on the legalization

today's episode of in the kitchen we're gonna be cooking cannabis infused cooking oil so what I have right here I have about 34 grams of shake I have about two cups of cooking oil and have about two cups of butter this video is sponsored this video sponsored by blessings on blessings dispensary in LA there are just 2157 west century Boulevard on the corner of Van Essen century so if you guys are ever in LA go ahead and check them out I'll leave all their informations in the description box down below but yeah they actually provided me with the shake for you guys that don't know what shake is shake is basically the leaves that fall out put a flower and settle at the bottom of the container this is some really high-grade shake it came from a high-grade plant if you guys get if you guys that's not as very much like you're just filling up my whole house my neighbors won't be big on big beech over here some but yeah so blessing a blessing dispensary supplied me with the shake shout out to my homie swag City over there he didn't want to subscribe me with the shake thank you guys for sponsoring this video but without further ado we gonna jump into it alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to decarboxylate the weeds basically we want to activate that Tec so the way we do that is we throw it in the oven a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes and it activates that THC that way we can put it into oil and do a further second step to activate the marijuana into the oil so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this in the oven and I'll see you on about 25 minutes alright peace so it's been about 25 minutes we just got the weed out of the oven as you can see I got separated to two piles 17 grams each like I said if you guys can see that color it got a little bit darker so now all that has to do is add the week to the jars and put the jars in a double boiler not really a double boiler I'm gonna do is put the jar and in a pot in the water that's slightly boiling like a like a mouth simmer you want the water to be about maybe 200 degrees and you want to put that in the water for about an hour and a half - two hours all right so now we're just going to transfer the weed to the jar I like to use the napkins cause as you can see it transfers very easy yeah I can see downtown let's begin for a same thing with your butter sack just to the butter so once again that's 17 grams of shake and about 2 cups of oil 2 cups of fat if you want to use the flour you can use a flower but cut that use about maybe a 8 3.5 grams of flour because the flour has more THC to the shanks so we're gonna have to go ahead and throw this into our boiler that got fitted over here slightly balding and we're gonna leave that in there for about an hour and a half to two hours we go come back and start pretty ugly I'll see y'all when it's finished all right peace alright everybody so a bit about an hour and a half we can go ahead and take these off now this one was my butter so we're going to do the butter first we got our storage containers right here this was restored in we got our strainer we also use coffee filters excreted and also this would be a double strain on there right oh so we don't do that like that big I like that hopefully I won't make a mess I'm kind of rushing because I got a I got a flank that I'm leaving for in an hour so kind of rushing but we still gonna do this the right way alright so this been in the pot boiling for about an hour and a half now we're just gonna strain it out and store it and that's all there is to it and that's how you make the butter and the oil alright so go ahead goodies over here at that point we make a mess kind of hot really I really wanted to use cheesecloth but I don't useful it's gonna take forever I'm just using the gate to squeeze not everything all - next one medicated [Music] [Music] sorry about the TV in the background I forgot to take that TV off okay it's not good like I said I'm Russian so I'm

now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "T7cyZzpyQJ4": "I actually kind of like the spoon yeah there you go okay it's me that you like I'd the way for you like alright now I feel like super self-conscious man I got thought about it for a second that's delicious let's make some cupcakes I'm in legal Washington and I'm leaving Seattle behind to head to Vashon Island where

we're getting ready to launch wow that's amazing and do you use all like the local ingredients right that's it absolutely and that's why we're here today because we're gonna make some cannabis cupcakes we're gonna use the cupcake RL recipe to make a chocolate buttercream but instead of the usual chocolate reuse we're gonna use good chip chocolate so first stop we need to get some butter and I want you to meet my friend Natalie who has this lovely farm that we're okay great so let's go check it out you know hi baby how are you doing are you doing very well I'm Natalie nice to meet you natalie has a dairy farm and we're going to pick up some cream and we're going to take that cream and turn it into butter and then we're going to infuse that butter with cannabis for our cupcakes and these are your milk factories right here huh exactly so I'm LT eat it this morning and I got her mouth and I have it in the farm stand for you if you like to taste something else that edith made i have some cream on one here this is the savory this has olive oil and salt and freshly ground pepper on it and this is just the fromage blanc with a little drizzle of local Vashon honey actually Natalie I have something to share with you as well some of Washington's finest but I don't know if you'd want to give this a go okay I can do it go yeah we can try okay great and it is from Washington it's called laughing Buddha and it really just one of my favorites on the market in Washington from a flower perspective all right I've never hot box before I'm standing before pretty great I gotta say let's let's get into that cheese okay so let's start off save that's your savory Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a little and now we have a nice smooth delicious looking manner that is looking super creamy these are ready to go into the oven huh this is this is exciting as soon as we open that door back up we'll have cupcakes let's put them in the oven 325 we're gonna start with eight minutes and then we're gonna rotate it after eight minutes and do six more minutes or 14 minutes oh yeah those are perfect it's like beautiful awesome alright so while those are cooling let's open some good chip chocolate and get ready to make our buttercream this is our deep dark chocolate bar the Washington state serving size is 10 milligrams Wow tasty there's no plain tea flavor and I can barely taste it yeah you really gonna talk about it - yeah yeah I like it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna melt eight-pitch of chocolate bar so this is gonna be 80 milligrams of THC spread across 12 cupcakes that's about seven milligrams of cupcake we did the math on the cannabis cupcake batter and that is scene or so a milligrams per cupcake so you add that plus the seven and rectory all right great pretty potent cupcake we're gonna start with putting 2/3 cup of our delicious hand turn fresh butter so we have two and a quarter cup powdered sugar we're gonna add a pinch of salt blend it all up slowly so you don't get the cup cloud we're gonna put three tablespoons of fresh milk going back to the Madagascar I'm going to put one teaspoon vanilla and we're gonna add the cannabis infused good chip chocolate yeah that was amazing we're gonna let that mix in we're so close to having cupcakes so I'm a big fan of a hand swirl instead of piping on although you can do the other and grab a little dollop and then you do a very magical thing to kind of Pat it and then you give it a little loop right I swirl on that one Cheers thank you so this is the best cupcake in Washington State huh let's see what you think mm that's a good cupcake oh my god experts you know what they do they go like this they break the bottom up and you put it on top super easy get out of town I wish I knew that point but into this thing this thing is double infused we infused the butter that went into the cupcake batter and we melted a bunch of your delicious medicated chocolates and put it right into the frosting boom boom this is a strong guy this cupcake right here is a representation of the adventure we had I had the fortune of seeing where all the ingredients are a lot of the ingredients that went into this came from really I mean it all just came together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly thank you so much thanks for coming out to Vashon Island today barring out the beat thought about defeat mmm that is one good cupcake", "jyAGlb8PMRc": "hello in 1996 my life was forever changed when after a botched back surgery I was left with severe chronic pain this began a cycle that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "icGZxDFddBk": "some mental health professionals are warning Canadians about an increase in cannabis induced psychosis they say that although the drug is now legal that doesn't necessarily mean it's risk-free let's bring in Chris Somerville he's chief executive of this schizophrenia Society of Canada joining me today from Winnipeg hi Chris hello so before we alarm people now that marijuana is legal can you tell me a bit about the numbers how much has there been a spike in people reporting cannabis related psychosis well now that it's legal to talk about it or rather to use it people are here to talk about the use and so the skits of Korean society is across Canada are experiencing more people talking about use and even though they don't have psychosis or schizophrenia I mean people come to us for other reasons as well around depression and anxiety and the main point I think is that no one should think that cannabis is harmless or benign I mean there are warnings for women who are breastfeeding who are pregnant there are warnings about respiratory problems so when we come to the brain a lot of people think that this is some sort of conspiracy the government or the society to keep people from using cannabis what we're all about informing people about safe use we do think harm and be informed about the rifts that can be had with use of cannabis okay so we don't have a lot of time so I want to get right to the nuts and bolts what qualifies as a psychotic episode and who's most at risk the first and most at risk for experiencing hallucinations and delusions in which interferes their ability to understand reality are those under the age of 25 because the brain is Neil Development Green conception and 25 those who use high potency cannabis those who use daily are to greater risk and those who have a family history of mental illness have a 5 infiltrator increase 40% of all psychosis Native Academy ok some good stats there appreciate that but to hear what you're saying or to delve into it a psych on episode is more likely to happen if you are predisposed to some kind of mental illness already that's not necessarily true see that's the great assumption that people think is that you're going to all you will automatically have schizophrenia regardless of whether or not you use cannabis or not schizophrenia is much more complex illness than we ever thought it is a number of illnesses and it's not just one genetic factor we know that people live and impoverished states have higher rates of schizophrenia so environmental factors are part of the development of schizophrenia and so are hallucinogenic drugs just a few seconds left then to tell me what's the messaging you're trying to get out today Chris well before you use learn all you can about safe use try to avoid use until you're in your late teens avoid high potency and certainly do not use daily because those who use daily tea have a two to threefold for your risk of developing psychosis appreciate your time thanks so much you're welcome Chris Somerville joining me today from Winnipeg", "COxEoW_rsLw": "well hi everybody great to be with you today as an accent my name's Samantha Miller I'm the president chief scientists of pure analytics and chief science officer of Humboldt brand products really excited to share with you today everything that I can about major and minor cannabinoids and how they work in your body along with some great things about current research on PTSD cancer neuropathy and more so let's get started you know cannabinoids are substances that are produced both in plants and in the human body and they're responsible for some but not all of the effects that you experience from cannabis and in fact some of the other effects may be due to things like terpenoids and flavonoids phyto cannabinoids are one type of cannabinoid so you'll hear the terms phyto cannabinoid and endocannabinoid phyto cannabinoids are the ones that are produced by plants the cannabis plant is the only plant that's known to produce really significant amounts of this viscous resin and when you look at close-up shot of the surface of a cannabis plant you can actually physically see the phyto cannabinoids accumulating in the resin glands so the resin glands are those little structures on the plant have a little stalk with a ball on the end and that's where the phyto cannabinoids actually accumulate so the THC and CBD are right there in those resin glands endocannabinoids are a very similar class of substances but what's really interesting about them is that they're made naturally in the human body you know back in the 80s when I was a little kid we used to see these commercials this is your brain and this is your brain on drugs and you'd see the two eggs in a frying pan it was really interesting to me to learn was that we actually didn't even know that there were things called endocannabinoids or something called an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that's a natural architecture for interacting with cannabinoids and that's actually the reason that humans have such strong interactions with cannabinoids is because we have this natural architecture in our bodies to interact with them the endocannabinoid system is a network of receptors in our body receptors we can think of receptors as little docking sites right in your brain and all over your body these little docking sites that cannabinoids connect with and cause all of the different things that you experience from them let's talk a little bit about THC and CBD and CBN those three together are often referred to as the major cannabinoids the reason is is because they're often the most prevalent although current analysis is showing that cbc maybe should be called a major cannabinoid these days as well because it's present in almost every sample and at a decent level sometimes higher than CBD the relative amounts of THC and CBD are of a lot of interest to people right now you hear people talk about ratios one to one and two to one and 15 to one and twenty to one and it matters it matters how much THC relative to CBD there is because those are specific for specific ailments so a 20 to one CBD to THC cannabis flower or tincture for example may be good for addressing one thing like seizure control where a one to one or a two to one CBD to THC substance or tincture might be the best thing safe for pain relief so the ratio is specific to the application so that's why we care about ratio and that's why we talk about it a question I get asked a lot is is there anything you can do during the growing stages of the plant to change it from a THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no you know I've been asked is there a nutrient can I water starve it can I change the light can I do anything to it to change that THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no whether a plant is THC dominant or CBD dominant is actually determined by genetics so if it's a 15 percent THC planner is a 15 percent CBD plant the fact that that's the dominant cannabinoid isn't something that you can change but what you can change is the total accumulation of the plant so that can be affected by growing conditions you know if a plant doesn't have the right growing conditions nutrients soil and water it won't produce as much cannabinoid and the final potency percentage won't be as high so that is something that you can affect now there's three main types of cannabinoid ratio that you can consider there's cannabis that's very high THC there's cannabis it's very high CBD and right in the middle there is cannabis where you have equal amounts of THC and CBD and again which bucket cannabis ends up in high CBD high THC or equal amounts of the two is determined by genetics of the plant THC is probably the cannabinoid that we're all the most familiar with it's the one that's been talked about the most it's the one that for a long time people attributed most of the effects of cannabis to this one molecule to THC we know more than that now which we'll talk about throughout this presentation today but the reason that people talk a lot about THC is it has some pretty big effects you know THC is the main psychoactive or intoxicating component in cannabis you know when we talk about that it's to indicate that there's a shift right and the way you feel in your emotional state when you consume THC now THC is referred to in a few different ways out there you'll see THC you'll see Delta 9 THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol so those are all the same thing THC is generally the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis but that's been changing as more people have focused on developing more CBD strains and we'll talk about CBD a lot as well today one of the fascinating things about THC is that it actually exists in different forms in the plant so you actually have THC acid as its dominant form in the growing plant and THC is the form that you find after it's been heated so when you put something in your pipe and smoke it you're actually doing some chemistry converting THC teach the acid to THC now there's a lot of confusion amongst patients about THC acid and THC you know a lot more is known about THC THC acid is just coming into our purview as something that we're interested in and we want to know about the researchers who are the original people who pioneered cannabinoid research when you ask them at the conferences you say ruff Raphael Michelin like why aren't you studying THC acid he was like oh there's nothing to it there's nothing there it doesn't have strong effects in the body near Raphael's around it's because of people who went out there is evangelists and as early adopters and tried this and have built bodies of anecdotal evidence to say there's something interesting going on here with these acidic cannabinoids so THC acid is the form it's in like I said before it's been heated that means in the growing plant or in dried material let's say on the shelf in a jar and dispensary that's the form that most of it is in the conversion of THC acid to THC is called decarboxylation that's a big word I like the word activation more and I think it's a little bit more intuitive so you'll hear me use the term activation and decarboxylation interchangeably at room temperature decarboxylation can actually also occur over time so as your cannabis sits in that jar you can actually have some of that conversion as well so it's not entirely stable smoking or vaporizing activates or D carboxylates THC acid and turns it into THC making it available for those experiences that you're most accustomed to for reliable decarboxylation of THC acid to THC you know a lot of people are interested in that because they're making their own medicine at home if you want to do that my best advice is to heat your raw cannabis you know don't put it into butter first but just the raw cannabis itself on a baking sheet in the oven so if you pre-heat your oven to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake it and keep it in a thin layer to make sure that the heat can actually penetrate all the material he did for 90 minutes and you'll have great THC acid to THC conversion so so why do we care so I've talked about this thing exists we have it how do you convert one to the other so but why do you care about it well the reason you care about THC acid and THC and the difference between them is because the effects are totally different and in many cases the therapeutic application is totally different depending on the patient and their needs and what's right for you it really depends on your desired effects and the relief that you need THC acid has been exciting to people lately because there's a lot of new people coming to cannabis and they want to try it for the first time they've got one hesitation though that's the intoxication component to it maybe they're not comfortable letting go not having control in that moment so THC acid preparations tinctures especially you can find THC acid in are a great way for people to try cannabis for the first time without a whole lot of danger of fear of intoxication there's a lot of interesting findings from these bodies of patient anecdotal evidence that we've been putting together to show that THC acid has some pretty substantial anti-inflammatory properties and may have some anti [ __ ] properties as well more work needs to be done on that but there's some clear indications that there's more to learn there you know when I talk about THC acid patients are really you know interested and concerned how can I get access to that like what kind of products can I find THC acid in well the the most direct way is through juicing so you can actually juice raw cannabis both the leaves and the flowers if you're juicing flowers you do need to add a little bit of water into your blender as well or school turn out quite right wheatgrass juice blenders juicers are actually the best ones to use because of the way that they process the material some juicers can actually activate the THC acid and converts it to THC during the process of juicing because of the amount of heat that's used so you want to use a juicer that doesn't have a lot of heat if you're concerned about preserving your cannabinoid acids glycerin tinctures that are made without any heat or alcohol tinctures made without any heat are another place that you can find acidic cannabinoids water extracted hash will often have a small amount of activation but you can keep the majority of it in the acid form as well and you can capsulize that so you can take it as an oral ingestible as a capsule so those are some strategies in ways that you can access acidic cannabinoids and try them if you're interested one of the other things that's been interesting as i've have worked with several patients concerning the use of THC acid and THC is there's a distinct time-phased effect that's different for THC acid what we've learned is that if you're interested in pursuing THC acid therapy you have to try it for a while to make sure you're actually experiencing the benefit for many patients is actually up to three to four weeks after daily use that they truly start to experience the benefit I have a lot of patients who approached me and they say Samantha you know I'm trying to choose is it THC acid therapy or is it th which one is it that I want you know aren't we funny as humans that way right we want to be an a/b thing but really the answer is it's probably both you know I myself I have fibromyalgia so I deal with chronic pain and there's days where I have really acute days they're really bad days acidic cannabinoid therapy on a daily basis is something that can lower the overall symptom level of someone who has a condition like mine chronic pain condition but on those acute days I probably need some THC and so they can really complement one another so the acidic cannabinoid therapy to bring down that total level of symptoms that you're feeling and the activated cannabinoids to really help you deal with that in the moment situation because THC as you know you feel very immediately and can give you that immediate relief if you need it to help promote your quality of life and keep you functional for that day when you are pursuing THC acid therapy especially if you're doing it to avoid intoxication you really do need to make sure you understand that there is going to be a small amount in that activated form THC present so you may still feel a little bit of psycho activity but it certainly should be a lot less than if the whole thing was activated again most of our evidence around THC acid therapy has to do with patient anecdotal evidence that's been gathered by various clinicians even dispensaries who are doing their own research there's a certain dispensaries have gone on a mission to gather data and figure out what's really happening with some of these unique substances some of the things that we've observed are reduction in inflammation and muscle convulsions in spasticity but the one that fascinates me the most is changes in cognitive development in children who are taking acidic cannabinoid therapies we see some really amazing shifts in their behavior both from THC acid and CBD acid we see changes and emotional intelligence in speech and cognition I'm fascinated to see what the further research on THC acid reveals and we should be really fascinating people often wonder what's normal for THC should it take care of my pain should it take care of my nausea like what is it really supposed to do for me there's been a lot of research that's been done there's certainly more to do but we have some really clear ground that you can stand on and say THC is great for these things it's great for mild to moderate pain relief and it's become because of that has become a great option for people to wean themselves off of opioid therapy say from post-surgical pain for some people they can deal with post-surgical pain using cannabis for many people that's a challenge and they often need the opioids for a few days but cannabis can be an incredible tool for getting yourself off of that addictive medication as quickly as possible so you don't experience those side effects control of nausea is a very significant finding around THC people with cancer and AIDS and who are taking a lot of different pharmaceutical regimens to help get them through their condition off an experience a lot of nausea and also the need for appetite stimulation as we all know THC does a great job at appetite stimulation sometimes when you don't want it to THC can also be a great solution for insomnia for many people helping people go to sleep and then stain is sleep a little bit longer the one thing that we should always consider especially for new users to cannabis who are trying THC for the first time is that for some people it's not always totally a great experience so if you suffer from anxiety or you find yourself on the bipolar spectrum or with schizophrenia or with conditions like that THC may exacerbate your condition so if you fall into that spectrum you really want to make sure that you work closely with your doctor if you're just thinking about exploring THC dominant cannabis and your therapy regimen and make sure that it's the right choice for you and then it's done in a controlled manner because everybody needs to be successful and their therapeutic regimen that one might need a little bit more guidance and some THC levels for flowers are really interesting you know in owning the lab for the last seven years it's been fascinating to actually watch that potency average rise in addition to the the potency average of flowers rising you see all these other kind of new products coming out but a lot of people wonder like what's normal for flowers what's average what's high what's low so in Northern California where my laboratory does testing we see the average range of THC dominant flowers to be about sixteen and a half percent once you get over about eighteen to twenty percent that's near in the strong range and over 21 percent you have a lot fewer strings that qualify and if another dividing line is 25% you do have some strains that perform over 25 percent THC but it's a lot fewer than below so it's good to understand what average ranges are and also that there is actually a value associated with those ranges and so if your economics of cannabis use matter to you then it might be good to understand what things fall into your price range and how you can best use those in your therapy regimen there is a whole class of patience right now who's really interested in the mild to moderate range of THC potency especially older people I know as I get older my response to THC definitely changes we often have a lower tolerance level for it as we get older so those lower THC products say 10% THC and below are becoming more attractive to those new people who are coming to cannabis for the first time so just because it's low potency doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's right for a different person than something that's high THC so we've had this explosion of concentrates especially in California I mean in every legal market I'm sure but I'm here in California so that's where I see it the most I remember the first time I saw a BHO wax I remember the first time I saw a shatter and as a chemist I was fascinated by it and I asked them about it and they wouldn't tell me anything it's top secret in others videos all over YouTube the times I think all of this stuff so it's certainly no secret anymore and as the secret has gotten out the proliferation of it's been amazing and what's really fascinating is it's really changed the potency thresholds that people are accustomed to and that they expect in the marketplace so interesting to know that Keefe you know so that's a cannabis that's been run and over a dry sieve say and the resin glands collected generally doesn't get over about 30 or 40 percent THC and more often it's actually a little bit below that with hash so traditional hash like you used to see coming se out of Afghanistan and Pakistan in places like that which you actually don't see much of anymore generally ranges between about 10 to 60% with average being at about 48 bubble hash which is water extracted hash still popular all it's waning in its popularity as other extracts come into the market co2 extracts and BHO extracts and all these different things that people are doing but water extracted hash you know averages at about 50% and really tops out around 65 or so you do have a few rare ones that go higher than that but the average is a real solid 50 percent wax or BHO or shatter co2 extracts you know those are chemical extracts so bubble hash hash and Keith are all made by what we call a mechanical process right where you physically remove resin glands and gather them and press them together whereas these new concentrates are totally different so they come from a process of chemical extraction so the extraction of cannabis with butane with co2 with propane some with nitrogen there's a variety of things that you can use but that chemical extraction as you might expect as much more efficient so you get much higher concentrates um ranging upwards of 90 plus percent definitely something to be careful with if you're a new user but can be a great source of relief and very concentrated dose of cannabinoids if needed for the right patient let's move on to talking about CBD a lot of talk about CBD people are really excited about CBD you know when I first started speaking to patient audiences seven years ago I would ask people who's heard of CBD in here and I get a couple hands half timidly raised when I asked that question to an audience today everybody raises their hand until they know what CBD is which is a really cool thing to happen in five or seven years so why do we care about CBD and what's the buzz you know what is it all about well it's different from THC in many ways in both the way that it makes you feel and a therapeutic applications so CBD has been called non psychoactive or non intoxicating the way I like to say it is you'll still be able to operate heavy equipment afterwards probably so CBD is a great option for people who again who are seeking cannabinoid therapy are a little concerned about the feelings of intoxication they might experience from THC and would really prefer to take baby steps in to cannabis they feel safer so CBD has become one of those things that people can try in a safe way in a safe place in addition there's a greater level of permissions right they've been created around CBD both legally and culturally in our society and that entry point of that kind of environment of permissions that's being created for CBD is really exciting because it's really been the impetus for changing the conversation around cannabinoid therapy focusing on the medicinal therapeutic and less on the psychoactivity and intoxication components that have historically been our kind of cultural association with cannabis CBD is interesting in that it's usually found at low levels so sub 1% less than 1% but in some cannabis it's the dominant cannabinoid although that does occur more rarely than with THC there's a lot of efforts underway to create more CBD strains their seed collectives there's independent growers there's companies who are making products now and they want the only specific cannabinoids to be present especially CBD so there's a lot of work around developing more CBD strains and creating more access to CBD for patient population so interestingly CBD like THC also has an acid form CBD acid or CBD a fascinating of course that both of course are non intoxicating as CBD is not intoxicating if THC is present though it's good to understand that you may still feel some feelings of intoxication so CBD does really lower the overall feelings of intoxication that you're going to feel from THC because of the way that they interact but you still may feel a little bit so if you do feel some intoxication don't be surprised it's because of the THC present the therapeutic uses of CBD and CBD acid are different a lot less is known about CBD acid fewer people have used it but it has been the one that has shown some pretty incredible shifts in children who are using it again as with THC acid the time to feel the effects are different so with CBD acid therapy you may need to be using CBD acid tincture or juicing three to four weeks before you actually feel that overall reduction of your symptom level one of the best stories that I heard about Beadie acid therapy was out in the village of Mendocino in Northern California and I was visiting a little collective out there called the Leonard Moore cooperative we've done a lot of work to try and promote CBD and there was a patient of theirs that had ALS and it was a fairly far advanced case of it and she was about to go into Hospice and the family was really upset about that they really wanted her at home you know everybody does better at home and so you know there in that moment of desperation and they were gonna try anything and they got some juice to cannabis from Leonard more cooperative and that juiced cannabis being given to her on a daily basis is what kept her off of a feeding tube and kept her out of hospice and so she was able to have really an incredibly higher quality of life through CBD acid therapy and there's there's so many stories like that we don't have enough time to tell but it can be a very powerful alternative to the drugs that people are using or the care regimens that we start to pursue as as people go into end-of-life so like with THC acid there is a recipe for conversion if you need to convert CBD acid to CBD say for a product or a tincture that you're making to help with your own therapeutic regimen and there's some specific conditions so again heating raw cannabis in your oven so not in oil or anything else is the best way to do it you want to spread it out on a baking sheet pre-heat your oven to 295 so it's a higher temperature than with THC and heat it for ninety minutes and you'll get great CBD acid to CBD conversion if you don't go to that 295 degree temperature your conversion probably won't occur or I'll occur in a partial way so really important that you hit that temperature and because it's important you hit the temperature I recommend that people buy an additional temperature gauge for their oven so you can often buy them right in the grocery store and the little gadget aisle you can hang it right in your oven and make sure that you're actually at the right temperature because I'll tell you our oven thermostats are terrible for the most part I have learned so when people are looking for CBD and they're looking for it the flower form they're often kind of restricted to asking about specific strain names some strains that you can look for that are likely to be CBD dominant are things like tsunami Harlequin canna tonic Harless sue can ASSU stinky pink diesel and of course Charlotte's Web that we heard about a lot from Sanjay Gupta interestingly stinky pink diesel was the first I know it's a funny name was the first high bead high CBD strain that was isolated and identified here in California through lab testing that happened at Harbor side it was a strain that came out of very very small growing community in Mendocino County called Koval oh and I remember doing a seminar out in Koval Oh about six years ago now in the public library there and as a very small place about six people came and the woman who actually had created that strain and submitted it for testing and was it was actually there so it was a pleasure to meet her she stills got those genetics and is holding on to him tight you know that's one of the things that's been interesting about CBD is because it's been so limited in supply and there have been so few people who have held the genetics there was a tendency for a long time to hold on to them and and not share them with people what's really exciting is that we've had some producers and breeders and creators like Lawrence Ringo who made all of their genetics available in seed form to whoever wanted to buy them so that's been a really exciting change in CBD is it's now very publicly available for people who say want to grow it themselves or work with it themselves the therapeutic uses of CBD are different from THC complimentary but different so it definitely deals with pain just like THC does but it attacks pain from a different side than THC it definitely reduces inflammation as THC does but it specifically deals with pain due to spasticity and there are a lot of chronic pain conditions that originate from muscle spasticity fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis I mean epilepsy it's origin is spasticity and that's why you've seen CBD become a go-to therapeutic alternative for many people who suffer from these spasticity related conditions CBDs also been shown in some more modern research to be very effective for eliminating chemotherapy induced neuropathy and also neuropathy in general even diabetic neuropathy so that work was done in a very formal setting and was actually very clear so CBD has a lot of different uses especially for people suffering from chronic pain one of its other major applications is as an anti-anxiety substance so CBD for many people who suffer from anxiety really seems to provide them incredible relief now I never recommend that somebody go off of their anxiety medication without consulting their doctor but for many patients they've been able to either find it as a compliment or a substitution for a more traditional pharmaceutical regimen that they were previously on CBD has also been shown in some research to perhaps have some anti-tumor activity for particular types of tumors a little bit later in the presentation we'll talk a little bit more about that research for people who are using CBD and THC together they have some interesting interplay with one another that's good to understand because they become tools in your toolkit as a patient and a user with a therapeutic regimen that you're trying really to have be successful so CBD actually prolongs the effects of THC and the way that it does that is actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down THC in our liver so when CBD connects with that enzyme it changes its shape and so THC doesn't fit in it very well anymore and can't be broken down and so it recirculates and we experience it for a longer period of time CBD also reduces the feelings of intoxication from THC so when I tell people that CBD is gonna make their THC last longer they're alright I'm gonna get high for longer well it's a little bit different than that you'll probably be less high but your therapeutic benefits will last for longer so it's a point at which we have to kind of separate those two ideas the expected CBD levels for flowers are a little bit different than for THC especially when we're looking at CBD flowers that have a one-to-one or a balanced ratio because think about it you couldn't have 20% THC and 20% CBD in the plant right no one to another they 40% cannabinoid and they just don't accumulate at that level no lab has shown that result yet so the only time that you really see CBD go above 20% or even in that range are in those 20 to 1 CBD to THC flowers oftentimes and say a one-to-one CBD flower you'll see something like 5% CBD and 5% THC or maybe 7% and 7% so the levels are a lot lower than you see in those THC flowers that we've really optimized for potency over so many different years how high the CBD level is again depends on ratio so if you're dealing with a twenty to one you can actually see CBD levels up as high as twenty but with balanced or with lower ratios you're going to see them more in the single-digit range so that doesn't mean that it's poor quality and I know we have this idea that cannabis at a certain percentage means that it's low quality so you kinda have to throw that out the door when it comes to CBD it's just an entirely different thing to consider let's talk about cbn a little bit you know it's gotten kind of a bad rap and you know there's a reason why it's a byproduct of THC degradation so when THC degrades it becomes CBN that usually happens in the presence of UV light and oxygen and I used to say to the growers that I would talk to you so don't put it in the turkey bag and throw it in the corner of your room and little light run across it and back and forth all day because that UV in addition the oxygen the bag is going to cause CBN conversion a lot of dispensaries and people in the kind of open market of cannabis view CBN is a negative indicator of either processing or age on cannabis that's true but it has to be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found throughout our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanied with Mersin are virtually equivalent so let's talk a little bit about some of the minor cannabinoids THC and CBD and CBN we hear about those a lot there's other ones that have started to percolate up you know we hear about them here and there but we don't know a lot about them part of its because not a lot of research has been done so there's more work to do but there's some interesting things to look at CBC is one of my favorite I think it has a lot of promise you know CBD has been shown to be a very powerful anti anxiety substance in the preliminary research that's been done CBC has been shown to have 10 times the anti-anxiety effects of CBD Wow interestingly CBC is present and elevated amounts in juvenile plants and then as the plant grows older and matures and flowers you have lower CBC levels there have been some plants that have been isolated that are CBC rich plants and they are actually mutant plants that can't produce THC and CBD very well and so because they can't produce THC and CBD very well the CBC is allowed to accumulate the reason why is that they all share the same starting material so this little pile of something called CBG acid inside the plant and the THC enzyme the CBD enzyme and the CBC enzyme all grab on to that CBG acid as their starting material to convert to become the cannabinoids that they eventually are THC CBD and CBC so when the THC enzyme and the CBD enzyme aren't grabbing any of that b:g acid it's just left there for the CBC in Xiamen it goes to town and starts to accumulate uns that's the only time you really see it at appreciable levels in a mature plant so there hasn't been very many of those identified so that's kind of that's the search right for the ambitious grower out there is that CBC mutant CBC's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects as well cannabidiol or CBD is an interesting one as well it's non psychoactive or non intoxicating as a CBC by the way again anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects seems to be a theme right you hear from almost every cannabinoid THC CBD CBC now CBG we're hearing that pain relieving an anti-inflammatory effects so if you're dealing with pain cannabis is a great solution or a great thing to drive for people you know we often hear about cannabis and glaucoma and I don't know we've all probably heard Peter Tosh this song where he talks about it too right I always associated that especially with the way people express it and talked about it what it had to do with THC but if you look at the research you'll see that what was actually shown to be reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients in the research that's been performed with CBG in many of the cases that have been identified so it's also an interesting molecule to look at therapeutic li CBG acid as I said is the precursor to both THC and CBD in the growing plant but you always have a small amount of CBG that's left over and sometimes it's not a small amount it can actually help growers look at an indicator of whether or not they allowed their plant to mature longer so a mature plant that was harvested in an optimal time probably have 1% or less of CBG maybe up to one and a half percent but you can see plants with as much as five or six percent CBG present in them basically what you're looking at there if it's not a genetic mutant is a plant that was just harvested a little bit too early that balance and that varying balance between the different cannabinoids as well as the other substances of the plant at different points of maturity and harvests are some of the things that shape preferences that people have say for early mid to late harvest products THC v also has a lot of buzz about it tetrahydrocannabinol it's a mouthful there's been limited research on it it's a very rare cannabinoid in my laboratory we've isolated three different cultivars of THC cannabis over 5% by weight so those are very interesting all in one small community in Mendocino so they've been kind of collecting genetics it's sifting through to them to see if they can find th DV and a few of them have the animal model research assist some interesting things about THC v relative to THC and that is is that the presence of THC v is thought to bring on the feelings of THC stronger and quicker so it quicker hi that's more intense but also has a shorter duration I said call it the quickie right if you can actually find the THC v cannabis there's also been research people say hey Samantha where do I get some of that diet weed and I say diet weed well what's the diet weed the diet weed it turns out is th T V cannabis so there's been some animal model research that suggested that it actually prevents the munchies which if you struggle with your weight and you smoke cannabis may be a significant issue for you not being proven out in humans yet so as soon as we get more THC th T V cannabis for everybody to try we'll have to run that one to ground and see if it really is the diet weed but there's a lot of people excited about the prospect of that right now there's also a related compound on the CBD side called CBD V Orkin a bit of Eron CBD v and THC v are both what we call propyl cannabinoids they have a three carbon ring on them that what makes them a little bit different CBD v is also a non intoxicating cannabinoid and it's thought to perhaps be one of the differentiators in CBD dominant cannabis that has greater or lesser efficacy for epilepsy treatment so interestingly in in groups of epilepsy patients who have been trying lots of different CBD strains we find that they don't all work the same some work better than others they maybe have the same CBD to THC ratio so you can tell it's not about that it's not just about the CBD and THC well one of the other things it's present can be CBD v and some preliminary animal model research has shown that CBD v has significant anti spasticity properties so it may be that the anti spasticity properties of CB DV when coupled with CB d really create the best solution for a lot of people when treating epilepsy and spasticity but more to learn on that as well there's a lot of exciting research happening right now and it's an exciting time in that our government here in the u.s. even is allowing more research up to this time a lot of it has had to happen in more international places in Spain and Italy and Israel and Canada who have had a Amsterdam who've had a greater level of permissions than we have there's been a few pioneers here in the u.s. dr. Sean McAllister is one of them he's out of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and Sean is a true pioneer you can you two of him and watch him all day if you'd like to what Sean did was he induced tumors into animals into rats so you can actually buy cancer many people don't know that but you can buy cancer and you can give it to things as in a clinical setting so these rats were given cancer and they were allowed to grow tumors in this case breast tumors were the specific case study that I saw from from Sean so he showed a picture of this ugly tumor on this poor rats chest and then he made CBD THC injections into that tumor and after 30 days of the injections at the right ratio of CBD to THC that tumor completely disappeared and the next thing that Sean shows is a picture of a rat with nothing but beautiful pink skin on its belly and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I probably wouldn't believe it because it's such an amazing transformation so Sean's work is really exciting he's really diving down into whether the specific cannabinoid ratios that are needed to treat a specific type of cancer Sean was a rebel he got his first research grant under the auspices of actually demonstrating that cannabis wasn't good for you and and bless Sean for that because that was how he got the funding to make these findings now the NIH is willing to fund his research at face value as a benefit for finding cures for cancer so that's an exciting shift as well there's been a lot of research on PTSD we have a lot of people in our society these days suffering from it from all of the wars that we've had recently addition to just the stress and pain of this fast-paced culture that we're all living in right now so there's been a lot of looking at how can cannabis help these people recover and come back to normalcy and enjoy a greater quality of life well we've shown that THC when it stimulates the cb1 receptor can interrupt memories and we all know that cannabis affects our memory wearing work and if personally in anecdotally but it can on a on a more clinical level so when your memories are disrupted that way when you have PTSD it can actually let you have that break where you can get control and get control of your thoughts and control that looping and that focusing on that negative experience you had which is the root of that PTSD so again through animal model research and showing that stimulation of the cb1 receptor eliminates these long term negative memories there's a real prospect of hope for people who are suffering from PTSD using cannabinoid therapy instead of other pharmaceutical alternatives there was some great research at Temple University on chemotherapy induced neuropathy as well neuropathy is the degeneration of the nervous system and there's a lot of pain associated with it the study found that when CBD was administered before the chemotherapy that could actually completely prevent the onset of chemotherapy induced neuropathy so for those people that was you know an amazing amazing shift they in a 2010 FDA clinical trial they actually concluded that inhaled cannabis significantly reduced neuropathy as compared to placebo in human studies so fascinating to see the FDA and 2010 was actually doing this research which is not well known so some great things on cancer PTSD and neuropathy and one that's really been in the press a lot lately has been treatment of epilepsy that's happening through the activated CBD being administered to patients often in tincture form or orally ingestible and it's causing incredible shifts and changes in people who suffer from frequent seizures I had a story from a fellow who called me and he went to tell me about his four-year-old daughter and you could hear the sounds of him making dinner in the background all of San sounds the family I liked him from kind of the first few words he said to me was hearing and he said you know my daughter has 800 seizures a day and basically that means she's in an intractable seizures all of the time I'm really desperate to find something to help her they've got her on all of these drugs or causing all these side-effects and she has no quality of life and no interaction with the family it was a very sad story and he didn't live anywhere near me in my state so I was able to help him with was information about CBD and strain names that he could look for to try and find something to help her he called me back about a month later he said Samantha I want to tell you about what's happening I said you know she was at eight hundred seizures a day and we've had her on a CBD tincture now for a month or so and she's down to one seizure a week and later on that young lady was down to one a month it gives you chills when you think about I mean can you imagine eight hundred seizures a day was no that's one every you know every if you figure out how many minutes there on the day and that's pretty much a constant seizure so the fact that CBD can bring this kinds of relief to people is something that's opening doors and opening minds about cannabis as a therapeutic alternative sir so many of these complicated drugs that are currently being used to treat these very serious conditions so it's I'm excited to be a part of and share with you this current research and maybe help open your mind and your landscape of permissions for trying cannabis and for supporting it in the use of your families", "i3oUc6F0rUw": "[Music] hey guys this is Leon and you have reached the vibe tribe today we are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "EBLmGBlEnMY": "[Applause] [Music] what's the first image that pops into your head when someone mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "7H3pe-bJxqw": ">>> >>> IT >>> IT IS >>> IT IS OUR >>> IT IS OUR MISSION

wellness industry the Center for medicinal cannabis says the UK is home to six million CBD users who take it in supplements cosmetics and vape liquids and with some of the best known pharmacies and health shops stocking up UK sales alone are expected to exceed 1 billion a year by 2025 advocates claim CBD can help with a seemingly endless list of conditions from anxiety to acne but what exactly is CBD does it make you high and most importantly to the bold claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has produces very little side effects to better understand health claims it's useful to split CBD into two categories wellness CBD and medical CBD wellness CBD products are available off the shelf in health shops and pharmacies CBD oil is one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles of CBD from health food shops and looked at what's inside them and sometimes they found that there's actually teach seeing them little or no CV some of them have alcohol in them to the level which they could be considered sort of an alcoholic beverage if companies don't adhere to these regulations by March 2021 then their products could be taken off the market the second type of CBD available is medical CBD there are a small number of approved medicines currently available on the NHS that contain much higher doses of CBD and there is some evidence to show that they may be effective at treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only doctors on the specialist registrar can prescribe these on a named patient basis with very little scientific evidence about the effects of wellness CBD and what the shorts or long-term risks are the Food Standards Agency says healthy adults should think carefully before using it and if you're pregnant breastfeeding or taking medication you shouldn't take it at all I also think that when it comes to CBD there's probably a really big placebo effect out there sort of global placebo effect because people are looking for something in their life that can really help them and they're not getting that from their general medications so then they're turning to sort of herbal medications and those having medications should be a quality standard that we all agree upon [Music]", "_isVrkK8zEM": "today I'm getting high maybe off a cannabidiol otherwise known as a CBD massage the treatment I'm getting today is a CBD soak combined with the CBD massage and I haven't seen this at any place else I'm really excited to try this treatment come along with me let's figure this out let's see if CBD really makes a difference [Music] my name is Daisy I am the owner and founder of Despard spa it is a very popular service so she will be getting today soaked we are using Cecil combined with CBD we are gonna add some bubbles I'm a central oils to make it a little more fun and relaxed and fluffy she would be in there for 30 minutes and then we're gonna follow her move her into another room and then she's gonna be getting a nice relaxing sport deep tissue massage we're gonna start using our massage oil which is the carrier CBD massage oil though such that we use for the CBD infused massage is 50 milligram per 1 ounce and for the soap is 100 milligrams per 1 ounce the CBD you can get all the fun medical benefits but you're not gonna get high you're not gonna get a positive on drug test for so you can just get all that fun stuff without being high some people some people experience a little tingling sensation everybody's different the benefits are the next day when she goes home you should go to sleep she's gonna wake up like a brand new woman I'm let into this room with this gigantic copper tub candles burning low light huge bubble bath and there's a smell in the air that's a little bit different than a normal bath smell it kind of has a herbal medicinal smell a little bit strong but still looks super inviting the smell is interesting because it smells like well it smells kind of like weed frankly like smell but it's definitely a strong smell the minute I put my toes in the water it was super warm and I immediately felt warm tingles in my legs and once I settled in I started feeling warm tingles all over my legs are fully floating and like tingly warm and tingly not mad at it okay guys just leave me here to soak I'll be here for the next thirty I'm at work right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] so after the soap go into the massage and that was a very welcomed experience after that warm bath she's using a CBD oil and the CBD oil right when it goes on it immediately you feel like a nice warm tingle and it's mainly afterwards that I still feel that warmth and that tingly feeling from the massage and she left the oil on and I still have the oil on so I still have that heavy warm deep feeling of relaxation I would say it did feel extra relaxed after this because of the CBD which was surprising I actually didn't know if I would feel anything at all I worked out yesterday I worked out pretty hard and I would say all that soreness is gone please let me know what I can be your guinea pig and try next because I'm down to try any beauty treatment so let me know using the hashtag ET style feed [Music] [Applause]", "ao56bUmUs5c": "again really like chewy delicious brownies you should actually like undercook them a little bit so they turned out so good but I ate too many of them and I probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria you would think on both of you were you Ray Oh ten nine hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make the og stoner snack infused brownies this is literally the easiest recipe to make I do a lot of baking at home myself but brownies are one of the things I always use a box mix for there's something about a store-bought brownie mix the honestly is just so good I'm also gonna show you guys a couple tips and tricks on how to make your brownies even better I hope you guys enjoy this video now let's get to baking like I said this is the easiest recipe and you can use any cake mix you can find I happen to have this giant cosmos icebox of RW brownie mix so we're going to use this one when it comes to making this the ingredients you're gonna use are gonna depend this on the back of your box so it's gonna call for like milk water eggs and butter or oil just the ratio would be different so you follow whatever is on your box and for my mix I need 1/3 of a cup of water 1/3 a cup of vegetable oil and one egg so what you need to do is wherever it says butter or oil you just replace that with your infused butter oil I have my oil here that I melted I do think you'd be better with butter than it would be with oil but I'm using what I have this says to preheat the oven to 325 degrees I already that force my oven is ready to go so the instructions on here say and these are going to be very similar for most box mix it's placed water oil and eggs in a mixing bowl and stir it until fully mixed so water oil and eggs and we need 1/3 of a cup of water just a little tip here some of these call for water someone call for milk and some him call for milk or water this one specifically calls for water and usually if it just calls for water it's because there's already a milk powder in here so we don't need the English additional amount of milk but it never hurts to add milk as well we only creamy value ingredients make everything taste better the end but these guard le ones are like super rich so we have our 1/3 cup of water will pour that in there we'll crank our 1 hag into there and then our most important ingredients are butter or oil like I said I have already warmed mine up so I can measure it out better and it calls for one third of a cup so on that for one third of a cup if your recipe calls for 1/4 cup or whatever cup you use whatever is on the box so I poured a little bit too much I'm just going to force them back a jar there we go so 1/3 of a cup going in to the mixing bowl and then we'll just mix that a lot let me add in the brownie mix it smells so good I love cookie dough but I really loved round batter too there's something about raw baked things that well before they're baked that is just like so delicious it'll of scraping off the raw batter off after now a little like extra tip is if you want things to be like extra rich and extra chocolaty you add a little bit of espresso or instant coffee I have a stress up here I'm going to add a tablespoon of this hope it's not going to be too chocolatey by adding this because these are deli ones are already so chocolatey to start with but the espresso just helps bring up the notes from the chocolate just like adds of a more complex layer to it so now we're just going to mix that all in there's so many trunks of like there's chocolate chunks in here already but if you're going to have that you can add America like you could throw in a bunch of chocolate chips at this point you could add in I'm M&Ms or Reese's Pieces or what love Reese's Pieces I'd be so good but yeah you'd be having anything you like sure and you want to add something like Oreos I would add them once this is fully mixed and then just like fold them in so they can get to chunked up I don't know and that's literally it that's all you have to do then we just have to pour it into our baking dish and cook them with the same amount of time that's been recommended on the box and they're good to go now we'll just line our dish with some parchment paper and we'll pour the brownian directly in this box says to cook them for 45 minutes that seems kind of long but I'll check in on them so I'm just going to talk this into the other and set a timer to check on it in 30 minutes to get really like chewy delicious brownies you should actually look under cook them a little bit but if you go overboard they'll be like really gooey and gooey which like I don't really mind it's like brownie batter but if you're ever trying to decide how long to cook it for always take it out a little bit before you think it should come out because it probably will taste better when it comes out the oven it dries a bit and then it will be like the perfect texture so the brownies are done I ended up cooking them for 45 minutes so I actually did do as long as the recipe said to do here's how they look they kind of came out a little bit lumpy because the way I put the parchment paper in there but that's all good I'm thinking of doing Detroit what you think I can do edible cookie cookie dough for the top layer before you eat the cookie dough 100 cooking the brownies I already did that these are gonna be really good I'm talking to you not like I'm talking to you but like I'm just like saying these are gonna be like tasty so they turned out so good but I ate too many of them and I probably shouldn't have and they're like super sweet and chocolatey I think we should get a taste tester Vittoria oh fast we got the try brownie oh I would they look good feed me well I wish when should I have well that one's just taking vitamins you can eat the rest after yeah I think that one you would take on dog with you send it back hmm what's a boy were you Ray a 10-9 mmm what we did have you don't want it Oh Toledo is what to me is it peanut butter cookie oh no but it's like coconut

so popular that it's begun to rival its psychoactive sister THC you may know that CBD can't get you high but can using CBD make you fail a drug test find out on this episode of weed easy by the growth of drug tests that look for cannabis analyzed a urine sample and screen it for marijuana metabolites since CBD derives from the cannabis plant you might rightly wonder if I use CBD can it cause me to fail a drug test for cannabis on its own CBD actually cannot produce a positive result on a drug test for cannabis that's because drug tests that screen for cannabis are looking for just one cannabinoid and that's THC a or tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid or the inactive form of THC click the letter I in the top-right corner of your screen to watch our episode on decarboxylation to learn how to HCA becomes THC and why that process is so important so if you only use CBD are you in the clear well it depends if you're using a high CBD strain of cannabis you'd likely think it's safe but this can sometimes cause you to fail a drug test many of these strains still contain high amounts of THC which will still set off alarm bells on a urine screen however if you're using hemp based CBD oils or pills these generally contain just trace amounts of THC at about 0.3% these products should not cause you to fail a drug test as long as you do not consume extremely high doses a false positive on a drug test can occur with doses of a thousand milligrams a day or more with CBD products though most people consume about 120 to 160 milligrams per day keep in mind that many CBD products are unregulated and therefore may contain cannabinoids that could get you into hot water for that reason we suggest sticking to CBD products that are lab tested and keeping your dosage at a recommended level while using CBD on its own cause a failed drug test no it won't but it's important to be aware of the factors that potentially could thanks for watching we DZ by the growth up subscribe to our

wouldn't not like to take one more bite astray we're out here in the wilderness in Alaska still right now we are going to make something that's called campfire ice cream with weed ague Doug isn't Alaskan version of ice cream traditionally made with whipped fat mixed with berries yeah I know things are different in Alaska they had to make do with what they could when they came up here we got some oil preserves over here al are measuring and container stuff you also have a bunch of animal fat yes this does make sense don't worry you'll see there's usually nothing better than eating some the most important part though me I thank you all right the weed this is honey banana and it's not going to make this taste like banana at all but it's a pretty good weed that's a good piece you want to cut it up small I don't know why I feel like you could tell this is high quality animal fat I'm not well-versed enough in that but yeah that ought to that butcher who just uh got a bear what the  was that noise I got the repellent on duck also another thing about the Alaska world in this man there are so many animals out here that will be just like two seconds and I definitely cut myself get me your alcohol swab real quick one of the types of bears you're supposed to like stand up and make yourself big or the one that's getting the fetal position you can Google which ones I don't remember off the top of my head that's the cool thing about living in 2008 - you need to give you all the answers I'm just a dude out here making wheat ice cream in the middle of the woods like I don't know why you would ask me for anything we almost got a cup over here it's gonna melt down we are going to move on whatever you want to dose yourself with that's up to you I got a long day ahead of me want to go take a hike and climb that mountain over there nice a little bit it's about 2/3 of the bag so yeah it's probably like a between a quarter and the fourth in here I'm not that good at eyeballing shake oh you ain't not getting me today one so now we're gonna go over to this campfire you have to wait a little warm first it's not learning it release some of that stuff that makes weed so worthwhile and good and next thing you're gonna want to do is add that animal fat so then you get the fat melt it down find some place to rest it so you're gonna need a cup of oil now looks great doesn't it we're gonna strain it out use a cheesecloth so if you have a pool little pot like this with the float out handles these also make pretty decent clamps and then I stopped pouring the mixture into here so next up this is ice cream so I'll be right back I'm gonna go climb the mountain and bring back a good little bit of ice okay crush it up so I need about two cups of this so keep crushing alright so you could also use I loose snow for this but as you can tell it's not really snow season there's about our second cup alright so now we're going to take our reserves they need about 4 cups of this and about a cup and a quarter of this and now just mix all this together man this is so gross gonna start binding and congealing this ain't just gonna let it sit for then it let it all bind together let it turn it to a thing [Music] so now you've given it some time to congeal and all that this is what your campfire ice cream is going to look like the term ice cream is being used like about as loosely as you could use the term ice cream without starting to refer to soup here we go it's more like a soft serve right yeah I'm a pretty big fan I used to ask anybody who knows we go well it's not awful but not like I would not eat this  if I didn't have to not really that that you get like the preserves time to soak up into the fat can definitely taste the weed in there that's can't

endocannabinoid system is helpful in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's finally from anecdotal information we know that certain patients who smoke marijuana experience relief of their symptoms I think you're calm down amazing he used just a single drop and his hands afterwards were rock steady and the dyskinesia left I bet it works most of the time oh did you guys see much oh yeah like we could really easy I wanna yeah please pretty angry that thank you my home state the number one frustration that I have is knowing that there is this untapped potential comes from what marijuana state is teaching us to generate new medicines and being stuck because of financial issues or politically issues that is extremely frustrating we now know that medical marijuana controls dyskinesia and yet it's not it's not available to us", "vsPaXApBsRk": "what's the best way to consume cannabis the only way to answer this question is individually it depends on how you want to take cannabis and what you're using it for there are a bunch of different ways to take cannabis you can smoke it or inhale it in other ways you can eat it you can drop it under your tongue for sublingual administration you could rub it on your skin for topical administration you can put on a transdermal patch so those cannabinoids pass through the skin each one of those has a different onset time and a different duration of effect it's important to realize what those differences are inhalation has the quickest onset time so you'll feel the effects almost immediately and certainly within ten minutes and it also has the shortest duration generally when you smoke cannabis the effects will only last a couple of hours and then they'll start to recede eating cannabis has the longest onset time and the longest duration so when you consume cannabis orally THC edibles or CBD gummy bears or whatever it can take up to four hours for you to feel the effects from that edible and then those effects can last six to eight hours it's a it's a commitment as far as time is concerned sublingual is kind of in between those so you have sublingual glands underneath your tongue that allow some things to pass through into your bloodstream a little bit more quickly and cannabinoids can pass through those glands into your bloodstream that means you'll feel effects within 45 minutes if you hold it under your tongue for at least a minute first and those tend to last four to six hours sublingual administration is usually combined with oral administration because most people swallow tincture is after they put them under their tongue and so you can get sort of a longer duration of effect if you do that topical cannabinoids usually you can feel the effects within 15 minutes and in my experience they would last about four hours there isn't a lot of data about a topical cannabinoid use out there right now one important thing to know about topicals is that they will not get you high cannabinoids are super oily and your skin is composed of layers of oil and water and so the cannabinoids can get through maybe the first oily layer but they can't get through the water layers and so it's just a surface level relief on a topical this is different from a transdermal product transdermal products go through your skin by combining cannabinoids with special carriers that help open up your pores in some way to get the cannabis into your bloodstream immediately and those products also work within about 15 minutes what's cool about transdermal products is once you take the product off fits a patch you'll also cease to feel the effects very quickly this can be really important for people who are a little bit older or maybe a little bit hesitant about trying cannabis for the first time because it can give them a very easy way to try and see what the effects are gonna be like [Music]", "2lsXC-BADyY": "- Nate started taking\nmedication for autism when he was around five years old. As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching.

store near you as of now you can make them at home but it is illegal for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the public health community on the proposed draft regulations Health Canada says cannabis products will be permitted for legal sale no later than October 17 2019", "qsK0IojtJ0k": "I'm gonna need some wine to go with the main that Marcel is preparing but I don't want just any ordinary wine so I'm up here in Northern California to meet up with pack smelly who's gonna show me how to make a cannabis infused wine that I'm gonna bring the dinner so you're actually infusing the wine by putting cannabis flour directly into it yeah the cannabis flour is added at three stages the first stage is fresh flour added to fresh juice pre fermentation and they soak together then we had about two pounds of crushed up flour this year the Blue Dream oh wow so the wine starts fermenting naturally with the cannabis flour for two three weeks and that extracts all of those terpenes and all of the flavor and all of the aroma that you get in the wine fantastic yeah I mean it already smells amazing so this wine is done fermenting and this flour is spent and so the flour pretty much floats to the top we're gonna squeeze out the flour that's been kind of steeping in here like tea and then we'll hop down here we'll open the bottom valve and we'll just drain it right out how exactly does the THC get in there the alcohol in the wine is what is extracting this THC I've heard of wine being infused with cannabis where they put in some kind of cannabis concentrate or something into it but this is clearly different than that it's like the flowers are fermenting with the wine for sure the terpenes and the flavor are all being extracted from the fermentation for me as a purist there's just something that seems very right about having the flower actually fermenting in the wine it just seems that you're really getting all of those terpenes that you don't get from just adding the tincture now that this has been drained off of the spent flower that it's been fermenting on for the last couple of weeks we're gonna take the same cured cannabis flower and add some of this to the clean wine just to add more flavor and more THC go ahead and like grind it up between your hands and so this aging process in the kegs takes about 4 to 5 months for everything to settle out of the wine we then rack that clean and then we stick it into a bottle and we got we wine then we got we learned right away you smell that fresh cannabis flower fermented with the wine [Music] Oh", "fwcAey-JFsg": "Good morning John it's April 20th. It's 4/20. Which I guess can only mean one thing, uh, Blaze it? Look, I don't smoke pot. I have, I don't really like it, and I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that cannabis is not harmful in any way, and that it's gonna cure every disease or whatever. But I think it's ridiculous and unjustifiable that marijuana is criminalized while more addictive and dangerous substances like alcohol and tobacco are available at every gas station in the country. So here are seven reasons why marijuana should be decriminalized and three reasons why it's more complicated than some people might make it out to be. 1. Legalizing marijuana is good for local economies. It increases tax revenue and it can increase the amount of small businesses that are successful. And I think that we should regulate both growers and sellers to make sure that those businesses aren't just giant conglomerates. We should not let like a bunch of Richie Rich pants who spent decades sending people to prison for selling marijuana suddenly get even richer selling it. 2. Illicit marijuana is a source of income for drug cartels that we could just take away instantaneously. 3. THC, CBD, other compounds in marijuana are legitimate medications. They can help with autoimmune diseases, people with chronic pain, seizure disorders, vomiting in cancer patients. And yet, US law defines marijuana as having no medical use. This is scientifically inaccurate. 4. Because it can sometimes help with chronic pain, it can help people who are dependant on opioids. And that seems like a good thing to not put in the same category as heroin. 5. The most successful story, maybe in human history, of decreasing the use of an addictive substance is the story of cigarettes. You can decrease use without criminalization. 6. The criminalization of marijuana creates real and obvious harm. Arrests, including juvenile arrests, have long-term impacts on people's lives, convictions even more so, and felony convictions result in lifelong marginalization and disenfranchisement. And this is why when young white people get found out for selling marijuana, they often don't get arrested, because everyone realizes that ruining someone's life for selling pot is dumb. And what we see over and over again is similar rates of drug use among white and black people, but far more black people getting arrested for it. \nAnd finally number 7: I don't hear people talking about this one much. \nWhen we make something very illegal, that is less dangerous than something \nthat is perfectly legal, I think that weakens the authority of the rule of law. People start to ask, like, if you're gonna ruin my life for doing something that doesn't seem like a big deal to me, then maybe the legal system isn't out to protect me. Maybe it is in fact out to harm me. That's a big deal. The more people who feel that way about the law, the worse society in total is. Now let's do the part where we admit that this isn't as simple as a lot of people like to make It out to be. First reason why: driving while stoned is dangerous and has been proven to be so. But there is no weed breathalyzer. So this is a problem. It is also not a new problem, it's a problem we currently have. 2. In legalizing weed, I think some people will think that that's like basically the government saying weed isn't bad for you. But it is. Long term use of marijuana, especially by young people, has been shown to have all kinds of negative effects. Most worrying ones being that it can increase the symptoms of depression, and other mental health problems, \nand cannabis use is a risk factor for schizophrenia. For more information check out this very good healthcare triage video. And finally number 3: You can't just legalize it. Those are two nice little words, but it's complicated. What do we do with people who are currently in prison? Who can sell it? How much? How is it taxed? What commercial zones are dispensaries allowed to be in? Like, these things have to be figured out. But the status quo, is a law that harms more than the drug, and I think that we're finally waking up to that. John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

this is life above the clouds and today I am going to show you another great method of making a cannabis infusion you can use this with olive oil which is what I'm going to do today but you can also use coconut oil or butter right now I have a piece of cheesecloth here that's folded in half so you make sure that it's double layered and I also have a little strip that I've cut off already and here is half a gram of decarboxylated cannabis so I have my cannabis in the middle of my cheesecloth and I'm just gonna fold it up like a little present so make sure that it overlap and this little packet so I'm just gonna take my little packet and tie it up with my piece of cheesecloth I'm just gonna stick it in to my jar and I'm gonna fill it up with oil give it a little shake make sure it seals and here I have a pot of water it's not quite boiling yet we want it to be at 200 to 225 degrees so I'm just gonna carefully placed it in clear you also don't want your jar to be touching the bottom of your pan or your pot if you have another lid from another jar you can place it underneath there you can place a dish towel underneath there I actually have this really great metal basket that came with my pots and I have the water about halfway just one enough cover the level of oil in your car so we let this go for two hours I pulled it out and let it cool down and now it is time to unseal this we're just going to fish out our little packet squeeze out all the oil we can see this is about as much as we can get out of this guy and there you have it you're finished oil so you can use this oil by itself like you would any olive oil you can use it to cook with in your pan you can use it to make salad dressings or you can use it to bake with which is the first my favorite thing to do if

tastes delicious they work great and it's just a nice feeling how is it very good [Music] the size of the crowd says it all cannabis could be the next big frontier in the beverage world but it wasn't a natural fit every single one of these drinks is made with an ingredient that doesn't dissolve in water our first beverage you can turn it upside down and you'd see that cannabis go up and down THC drinks were a little bit like salad dressing so they had to be shaken and bottom didn't taste or smell that good it all comes back to a simple truth oil and water don't mix it's backbase it does not mix well once you add it to beverages though it starts out as the green plant we all recognize the cannabis we're talking about gets distilled into a thick oil that's nearly solid at room temperature it mixes well with the makings of chocolate which are also fat based so companies like Stillwater ingredients hired experts from the candy industry we've solved it before our eyes they pour these crystals into a glass of water and they appear to dissolve lipids cannot dissolve in water but you can do is coat them in a surfactant and then enable them to be water compatible Industrial sauna

be no surprise the industry's going after a specific customer those who are less experienced with cannabis but love trying new drinks craft beer consumers are perfect for cannabis drinks because they're into experimenting new beverages and though there is hemp beer and weed wine there's one thing you won't find drinks can have cannabis or they can have alcohol but they can't have both it's the ultimate irony stopping nausea was a major reason marijuana was first legalized for medical use because remember cannabis isn't only about getting high all right bring CBD into the sports world now legal in all 50 states hemp derived CBD is making his way into seemingly everything including this sports drink it really is calming it helps with pain inflammation Guardian taps into a whole other market for these drinks those looking to use cannabis for wellness so we wanted to go with the all organic no refined sugar they're going after the same crowd as eat green people come to cannabis to help them with their health I don't want to give someone diabetes while trying to help them come back eat Green makes cold-pressed juices in three different versions it's this the packaging right here the hemp drinks can be sold anywhere the first thing I smell is watermelon is there real watermelon but at dispensaries they sell THC versions one with a little and one with a lot

America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

things that are going on right now i think are probably the california fires and making our weather uh in vegas like apocalyptic for like the last three days i was looking out my window and seeing zombies that were gonna come out any minute any minute i wouldn't really does look like that doesn't it it's uh there's like this haze all over the city it's weird yeah you know 2020 has already shown us anything it's shown we can't trust her so like i i literally saw i was just thought like any minute now it's gonna be zombies or aliens or anything i wouldn't even be suppressed oh yeah and and some asteroiders is supposed to uh come close to hitting the earth uh in the next couple of months too so that to look forward to and i just found out today that on on halloween night it will be a full moon which happens very very rarely so uh we got halloween coming up and uh we know everyone at least will be wearing a mask right so so that'll be good i wonder halloween's even gonna happen yeah but yeah you know that's a funny thing like they're all like wear that square mats you have to wear a mask but then like the one holiday where you know pretty much you all wear masks uh los angeles the city of los angeles canceled halloween this year oh wow so i don't really understand it you can go out and riot and you know you can go fight for your rice and be outside you can go grocery shopping but your child can't go door-to-door and have them and everyone wearing a masks and you know get some candy yeah i think a part of that problem is that humans can't be trusted right i mean i mean knocking on someone's door i mean halloween first of all is a strange tradition where you knock on people's doors and beg for candy right i mean it's a very strange ritual um and uh and humans can't be trusted they just can't uh well oh well trust uh you know due to every year on halloween i have to deal with the news you know blasting to the mass society of the evil edible ships that are going to be using the candy and giving it to your children right because that's exactly what i want to waste my cannabis on right i know that i always say that too every year every year when that comes up i always say there's not one person who is buying a 10 edible and putting it in the kid's bag just to get at them it's just not happening you know they're too expensive and they're too valuable i was about to actually one of those kids you know i like dressing up don't get me wrong but i don't need halloween to do that but the whole like candy thing for me uh like my in my youth it was destroyed because i i'm one of those lucky few that are allergic to peanuts so and i'm an 80s baby so um candy goes in uh fads of the time like you know in the 70s everyone literally liked licorice and a niece like those that flavor like that was when twizzlers hit the market and everything well the 80s 90s baby well that's all peanuts and peanuts just took over the market and they did it with the cunning use of television and marketing because yeah the butterfingers with simpsons you had uh the baby ruth with sandlot you had reese's pc's with e.t phone then you had me this poor little girl that just had to give sixty percent of a wave or candy to her older brother and uh so sarah and sarah warheads i do miss those sour warheads right and your father probably didn't even appreciate it he just didn't even appreciate it didn't didn't love you anymore right i don't know he became that that wasn't his mean stage of being the big the older brother where like he's just like i just came back with like trick-or-treating and you know he was just like give it to me yeah i guess i already knew that i was just gonna be like handed over like all of my hard work for free yeah so you brought up the fires in california and uh and even up in oregon and washington i mean it is a mess out there so if you're out in oregon and you're uh in california uh please be safe out there um i have friends that uh lost their house up in oregon and the whole neighborhood is just devastated um you know i know you're you're meeting today with our good friend uh shelby and uh her brother actually uh lost his house and uh it's just devastating you know you don't realize that uh suddenly a fire can come in and just take everything you own and it doesn't exist anymore and even though they're just like items and and you know but there's photographs there's you know documents there's all of that stuff imagine coming home one day and having nothing just absolutely nothing but the clothes on your back it just must be devastating so if you guys can help any in any way i should i'm sure you can reach out to the red cross in uh california in oregon and washington and uh do what you can for those folks that uh are literally losing uh uh they're losing ground every single day i mean literally millions of acres uh have been burning in california it's the worst they've ever seen and uh it's a good thing there's no climate change right oh yeah good thing about that because imagine if that was involved and also a good thing that you know now there's a wave of like gender reveal parties you know we never had that crap when we were growing up like like ever and i'm a little upset about that because you go to party city and you know you got the baby blue and the baby pink and you know celebrate you know the what are those things called baby showers but they have zero divorce parties you don't see any freaking like decorations or anything like you're not celebrating none of that and i've celebrated way more divorces than i ever have right right my friends so that's funny i have a friend here and uh i have a friend here in vegas who used to do that now she's in the cannabis space she uh she owns a cultivation um but she used to be in the divorce party planning business she went through a really ugly divorce and she was she's exactly like you said she's like there's no there's no way to celebrate what do you mean there's no parties so she started a uh a divorce party business where she set up like a tour you come to vegas with your friends and you know you do a whole thing and it was uh it was pretty funny and uh but now she's in the pot business uh glinda road shout out to glinda over at the growers circle um i said bless her heart because you know i'm the divorced one had to be way more lucrative than it is with the cannabis industry she's not nearly taxed or hated and she's illegal yeah they do grow some pretty good weed over there at grower circle so if you're in vegas make sure you check them out and look for that face on fire which is uh one of my top five favorites here in uh las vegas um anyway glenda rhodes is a good friend and uh yeah she used to be in the divorce party business um and now she grows weed exactly everybody's doing it guys everybody's doing it right right so uh so today we're going to talk about topicals i know uh people always ask me and i know they're always asking you you know what's the deal with topicals do they work there are two different kinds of topicals of course this is a brand uh here in vegas called remedy and this stuff is really good i'm a big fan of the remedy brand it works tremendously uh for sore muscles and aches and pains and you know if you hurt yeah you know if you have a back ache or something like that i also use it if i ever get a headache i'll rub it a little on my temples and uh it's really good for that as well yeah make sure you're right here yeah yeah and here's another here's another brand from uh from hemp inc that is a non-uh thc topical it is uh hemp seed oil mixed with tea tree and this is an incredible antiseptic um and works great on cuts and bruises and scars and all that kind of stuff we uh we really call this a miracle uh you know uh tincture because it really helps with everything and and uh the remedy stuff also really good when um like i said you have uh bruises and breaks and sprains and all that kind of stuff what's your experience with uh with topicals and uh do you use them and uh work i make a big batch of my bathtub and then i just submerse my entire body in there and then i just soak it all in ah so topicals as a bath now uh i i do get asked all the time if topicals work because you know they're unfortunately that ladies and gentlemen you got you guys well you guys need to watch see how you can tell if your cbd products are fake video with me and this man right here it's a few videos back but definitely check out some of that content because that kind of goes into the topicals if they don't work or not make sure you're getting them from a licensed dispensary um check your resources check the reviews if they're just a cbd company because there are quite a lot of them um but for me topicals are amazing um i have you know we're talking about the fires the fighters just took our temperature down from over like in the hundreds to 71 right now today so it's officially hoodie season for a day in las vegas right for a day so don't get too connected right exactly like no my arthur and my carpel they flare up so bad um you know i got carpal from being uh you know over a decade in the can in the cannabis candy industry because you know i was the machine now we have big big mac daddy machines that make all the gummies but i used to just have to pop molds all day every day so you're welcome to anybody that's had my products in the last 10 years i gave my hands to you right but um but now topicals is pretty much one of the best things other than ingesting you know my edibles it just it really helps with localized area and especially since my localized area happens to be on my hands um something that i could definitely recommend to many which uh topical companies really don't disclose because they don't have enough room on the package to tell you these things and um that speak like i want to clarify that there is highly absorbent parts of your body that will absorb the medicine faster and give you a faster relief so like you know how todd was saying he puts you know little dabs on you know on his temples your temples and your forehead especially your third eye that is the highest most absorbent part of your of all your skin on your body then you have your glands on your neck your hands they're very highly absorbent uh your genital area your feet your feet are very highly absorbed is also like a third exit and an entrance the backs of your knees also your armpits your armpits are like the fourth highest absorbent part of your body so if you have shoulder pain which many of us do like make sure you rub it like you know before you put on your deodorant because all of that would block a lot of it coming through but make sure you massage a little bit of your lotions or sad into that area because it will get to yeah it will get to your pain area a lot faster as well as putting it on like the localized exactly where it hurts right and without making any specific medical claims which is not what we're doing here um but they work for me and they work for you and they work for lots of people uh you know all around the world and uh the topical business has become a very large business i know uh you make some topicals too don't you i do i do i love it for their aromatic qualities uh you know like my bath bombs i make them with american green cbd um you know we have bath bombs and lotions and sass and all of those um i mean you know how i take baths every day like that's that's fine happy places in water so um bath bombs are definitely probably my number one favorite when it comes to just getting rid of the aches and pains right and if you want to see dee in a bath just make sure you log into her instagram account at edible d i'm in the water again it's like i'm always in the water right and you can see your clothes in the water and sometimes your knees once in a while you see a shin or a thigh [Laughter] from button for mountain that's right that's right so uh so you're gonna take us through uh how to make your very own topical sav right yes yes i have an amazing sav recipe that i did that i also add a little bit of lavender petals making it nice and cute for you guys it's a very simple recipe that you can make them at home they're excellent for gifts as well as topicals are probably the best introduction that you can give somebody that is not versed in cannabis or cannabis products it's a great like because it's non-invasive they're not going to test for thc like if there is thc in that particular product um and you know they will find relief you know there's lots of anecdotal evidence including you know todd and myself where it does work so it's a nice introduction for them for people that are like oh i don't know about trying cannabis or no weed is still the devil's lettuce and like no trust me just you know make a nice little badge for yourself it's also fun to do with your family or your friends and they're great for gifts so definitely check out my next recipe it's on the back of this video dropping it for you like it's high right and and uh also topical one of our many words that we went through on the cannabis vocabulary terms so if you want to learn more about cannabis terms check out tnmnnews.com and uh edible d and i go through uh about 40 words and we tell you what all that stuff means and topical is one of them so so let's go to the how to make a topical with our favorite chef edible d [Music] what's happening happy people all right today's video we're gonna do a smaller batch of the warming muscle salves that i make commercially into some gifts for some friends in an at-home version for the happy chefs at home the printable version of this recipe is available on my website www.edibled.com under the recipes tab and of course don't forget today's formula let's get cooking [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] what's that happening all right so you have your double boiler you put your coconut oils and your olive oils in there you take your little froggy guy a little happy froggy guy now you could also do this with a cheesecloth and like strain it if you're using loose leaf and whatnot if you you know because you don't want those uh plant plant particles in there but this way i don't have to strain it with the cheesecloth because i just have this little baby is my little infuser and i put like all the peppers the cbd isolate is in here the eucalyptus the ginger the witch hazel all the good ingredients that you just seen so you're gonna let this go i'm gonna turn down the heat i was on medium high heat first just to get that coconut oil to uh liquefy but i'm going to turn it down a little bit to like apply around medium solid medium let this baby infuse now after this after this is in here for about 20 minutes um then you're going to take it out because the bottom of this is stainless steel if you're using cheesecloth don't worry about it but once this infuses for 20 minutes then i'm going to take my decarboxylated cbd more of the babies and then also my doubts and names because both of them are great for this topical right now and then i also add in zelena lowell one of my all-time favorite terpenes present and over 200 species of plants mainly in the plantai family but as well as citrus fruits and uh the fun guys be sure to eat your mushrooms people but i wish you guys could smell through the screen because oh it's heavenly but beware because this aroma can detoxify you by itself so we're going to let this sit for like 20 minutes come back to it and then i'm going to remove the frog infuse the oil and then i add the beeswax now this is what's going to make it that sad texture like that petroleum jelly um and then i'm going to pour it into these tins let's see shabbam and we'll see how we decor these in just a few minutes all righty guys you take out your infuser with pam and now we're going to infuse her let's see here the cbd exhaling alone oh it's roughly like say that was roughly like six ml in this batch in this particular match and okay about one ml of that yay [Music] make sure you're always mixed with silicone because the oil will not stick to it like it does oh this is is it looking cute all right all right so now that we got it all infused here now we have to add the beeswax turn up the heat a little bit turn it back up and let these little wax pellets melt make sure you keep mixing oh they're melting so quickly so once this is all emulsified then you're going to turn the heat all the way off and you got to work a little fast because this you want to have it already poured into your containers whatever it's going to be stored in or gifted in and you want it to solidify let it sit out for like say 10 minutes and then we're going to sprinkle some of that lavender petals on top so it just looks so pretty yes look looking that it's it's really it's there i think it's there i think we're done guys i think we're done it looks ready okay i just turned her off okay look at all that smokey okay so i'm gonna take this bowl i'm gonna pour it into this measuring cup just because it would be easier to pour into my containers yeah i'm getting some on the counter it's okay i'll rub that on myself well there you have it that was awesome dee thank you for that um and now you know exactly what it takes to make your very own sav or lotion you know to use you know on

what up? It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller,\" and first I got my guy,\nthe comedian extrordinaire -- Hannibal Buress. Hannibal: What's up? \u266a\u266a And last but not least. The man that put\nthe 'G' in geek. We're talking about Tommy Chong,\nladies and gentlemen. \u266a\u266a Please, please, please. And we have\none common denominator. We enjoy\nthe fruits of our labor. -Yes. -If I must say so myself. We're going to\nhave a dish that is infused\nwith expensive marijuana, and hopefully\nwe don't pass out doing it. This is Zairilla Bacon. \u266a\u266a So tell us what's going on. What you got here? Right here we've got\nthat Z Juice, which is medicated Kool-Aid. -Okay. I've got the watermelon and this\nis my new flavor, peach mango. Each bottle is 100 milligrams. I make my own THC lean syrup. 100 milligrams, how would that\nhave you after you drink it? Well, everybody's\ntolerance is different. If you have a low tolerance, maybe about\na quarter of the bottle. A quarter of it? If you've got\na high tolerance, like myself, I just chug it.. -Yeah. -Yes, sir. Let me see you\nchug out off. -What? -You won't chug this. I wish I had my phone. -She didn't hesitate. -You ain't got your phone? -She didn't hesitate. She's going to chug\nthat mother fucker and it's got\n100 milligrams in it? Keep out of reach of children. That's some deep shit. She's going to be\ndifferent later. Oh, man. She's not even going\nto take a break. She's just -- All right. -I stay highly medicated. -Okay. Yeah. Highly medicated. This is\nthe mac and cheese. It's going to run you\nabout $500. You charge. Your shit high, shorty. Just a little \"turch\" of that. Not too much. Just a little \"turch.\" A \"turch.\" -Just a little \"turch.\" -Yeah. That's enough, that's enough. -Right on. This is my Zairilla's medicated\nchicken wings made with my Zeewee's\nfrom scratch BBQ sauce. In Chicago,\nwe call it Mouth Sauce. -Mouth sauce? Yeah. -That's right. So, we're going to eat this\nand get high? You want to try\nsome of this shit right here? Tommy, wake up. You want to try\nsome of this shit? [ Laughter ] -Already. Already. -Come back to earth. Come back here, man. -See that shit he's doing? -He's eating wings with --0 That's what you do\non a first date when you're trying\nto get some. Medicated wings,\nI'm very careful with. Oh, you've had\nthis before? I know what happens when you --\nwell you'll find out. Hannibal: This is going\nto get interesting. -So is the stuff in the sauce? -Yes, sir. -Also in my batter. -You hittin' it from both ways? -Yes, sir. -These are crispy. That's how\nit's supposed to be. -I like it. -What's that? -What's that there? -This is the asparagus. -The whole thing is? -It's reefer, too. -Every piece. -I use it in my\ninfused olive oil. Oh, it's in\nthe olive oil. You can't even taste\nthe reefer in it. That's the tricky part. -That's the best part about it. I love that, too,\nbut I think that's low down. I do. That's some low-down shit. You're making me\nwant to eat, man. It's a trick. This shit's tricky. You feeling anything? Well, you'll know\nwhen I'm feeling something because I'll panic\nabout the cameras, and run to my car\nand leave. [ Laughter ] When I run away from everybody\nscreaming it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I think\nthe asparagus got to him.\" Zairilla: That's usually\nabout $75 a pound. Really? So how much does\nthe Kool-Aid cost? -20 bucks. -20 bucks? -20 bucks for one thing. -For this thing right here? Yes, sir. She just drunk a $20\nright in your face. -After 20? -[ Laughs ] Yeah. You're looking at\nthis big platter of wings is normally about $1,500. -These wings about $1500? -$1500? -Yes, sir. -That's about 70 wings. So that's about, what, $7\nand some change? Wait, am I bad at math? -You're horrible. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Oh, that's about $20 a wing. $20 and some change,\na wing. -A wing. -Holy shit. I just ate\na little $40. Those are\nexpensive wings, I see why Viceland\ndidn't pay me to come here. [ Laughter ] I think that shit's\nstarting to kick in. This is\n$20 and some change! Tell me what you think\nabout the food. I ate\n$60 worth of wings. Tommy, I'm talking to you. Tommy. -It was only three of them. Shit's good,\nain't it, Tommy? I love the greens. These, whatever these are. Asparagus makes\nyour pee stink. Is that true,\nor is that just just a myth and we went with it? It has an acidic base about it\nand when it mixes with a certain chemical\ninside your body, it lets off a certain scent\nas you urinate. \u266a\u266a What you got\nright there? Zairilla: So we got right here\nmedicated crab legs. Come on with it. Now these crabs normally\na pound go for $275 a pound. -For real? -Yes, sir. When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish? No, baby, we got\nsome lobster tails. Oh, lobster, see, man,\nI don't know my seafoods. This mother fucker\nsaid crawfish. I thought it was just a big\nass crawfish with a God damn -- That's lobster, man! And one lobster right here\nis about $525. -This? -Man, hell no, shorty. For real. -$525. -This right here is $600? $525, you rounding. That was a big round up. -$500? -Very nice. Very tasty. $500 for a lobster tail. A small ass lobster tail,\nbut it got the dope in it. How much is in that? That one has\nabout 25 milligrams. Shorty,\nthis shit good, shorty. I feel myself\nbecoming different. -Can you feel it? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I ain't going to lie, I think\nI'm feeling a little something. Do you feel pressure to wear\nmultiple chains all the time? Shut your high ass up. 2 Chainz. I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71. When the Northridge\nearthquake hit. -And I'm eating, getting big. -Sea bass, halibut. And then\nthe earthquake hit. What's your favorite\n2 Chainz song? 2 Chainz. I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris.

So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000? First, we've got\n24 1/8th worth of flower that are delivered\nwith it. -So three zips a month. -Then cannabis cigar set. Got cannabis leaf, I've got\ntobacco, and I've got gold leaf. Three months aged,\npressed, and with rosin and sap\nin it, as well. Then we've got 24 vape pens,\n24 edibles, 24 topicals\nand tinctures and then each one will\ncome with a custom... -Gold tip. -24-karat gold. 240 diamonds in it. You got to let me\nkeep this, man. This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here. This is my custom box that would\ncome with the $24,000 box. What kind of wood\nis that? So this is\na reclaimed wine barrel. That's dope. That's how I need to get one\nof my floors done, wine barrel. -Somebody locked it on me. -Did you lock it on me already? There it goes. So you open it up... -It's nice, bro.\n-...it's all gold inside. Got your flower all ready,\nloaded up. This stuff\nit'll keep you fresh. It's my box? Is this for me? -That's yours.

interview series for marketing profs i'm talking today with ryan stewart about cannabis marketing ryan is the founder of the agency web risk how are you ryan i'm fantastic carrie thanks for having me how did you become involved in cannabis marketing was it like a passion project to begin with or like you did your clients bring it to you so so so i will say that i i am a cannabis user myself um so just being that i've always been open to you know and also just seeing how the market has exploded obviously because legalization um and commercialization all that stuff i have a friend who uh moved to la probably about three years ago and um opened up his own cannabis brain it's actually incredible they're they're doing very well now but he ended up introducing me to somebody who needed help with seo um it was a woman who had uh a singular cannabis product actually out of based out of boston and the cannabis product is a machine called a decarboxylation machine so for for for context what that means is when you smoke cannabis uh it when you actually apply the heat to it it activates the thc in the cannabis which allows you to feel the euphoric high feeling if you just try and eat cannabis on its own you're just going to get sick because the cannabis the thc isn't activated the thc is the element in it that you know acts as medicine acts as a drug what have you so she developed a machine for medicinal patients with cancer who couldn't smoke because obviously smoking if you have cancer is is not good for you frowned upon yes yeah exactly so her machine what it did is basically you just take the raw cannabis you put it in you push a button and two hours later it's activated it's a certain heating mechanism that allows the thc to be activated within the cannabis and then after that then you can take it and you can you know put it in food you can put it in oil you can put in tinctures there's a whole bunch of applications for cannabis especially now that i think it's being viewed on as less of a drug and more as a medicine for a lot of folks that um it's really a wide-open field so her product she was having a lot of trouble getting online visibility because a lot of cannabis companies are blacklisted from advertising um you know you tell me about that like even where it's legal you know to varying degrees yeah well i mean the internet the internet is kind of a global thing so they don't necessarily abide by state boundaries um you cannot advertise directly on google to sell cannabis um you can't advertise on facebook uh it's very difficult to even build a youtube channel organically around cannabis content you have to be very careful there's certain grayers that we can explore more that you have to understand how to maneuver which is what i ultimately had to help them do but also just increase overall organic so the good thing is that google organic obviously you can post whatever you want you get it to rank as long as it's not about hate or violence or anything like that um so organic search for cannabis is is probably the the main channel for a lot of companies for revenue um so they hired me to help with that my background is mainly an seo but then we also had to develop an advertising and uh strategy within google and facebook to help them just pile on more bottom funnel conversions so how does that work so the advertising restrictions on cannabis how do you how do you work within them so um again it's a gray area it's it's it's frowned upon i guess is what you call it but basically what you have to do and this is two years ago uh right now we they they brought advertising in house so we're only working with them for seo and content marketing at this point but two years ago when we were working with them basically you have to do is you have to uh number one so if your facebook page and instagram profile is about cannabis right which you can't get around you pretty much got to create a separate profile um so if you take a step back and you look at again they're not selling the actual drug or product of cannabis or selling a product that helps with cannabis consumption and from a dis a medicinal point of view as well so what we did is we created a facebook page that was called art and herbal they're called art and cannabis that's the name of the brand we created a page called art and herbal which basically we were just kind of posting pictures and blog content from a separate blog that i'll talk about in a second that was basically just talking about holistic medicine because again depending on who you are and how you view this topic cannabis in my opinion anyways is medicine for a lot of folks so um you know again like different usages for tinctures and oils for uh for for body aches for pains for stress for anxiety um for all sorts of different things so we're just building some content naturally on a blog again on a separate domain that was tied to this page what that does is it kind of get lets facebook's algorithm kind of turn a cheek to it and not view it as a cannabis page right as long as you're not posting smoking in an actual leaf then you're okay so after you have that up and running you basically got to set up another ad account that again is not tied to that brand but tied to that page and then from there just running very high level kind of again letting the facebook algorithm understand what your page is about understand what your audience is just running blog posts that are again talking more about holistic medicine um and not about cannabis usage after that after you go ahead oh i was just wondering so it's sounding actually you're talking to end users but really it's a b2b brand in a sense it's they they're they're b2b and b2c they actually hired me to go more b2b so sorry it's more b2c because when when cannabis was first decriminalized and made i guess legal for medicinal patients they were selling all b2b they're selling to dispensaries they're selling to you know building relationships with doctors and they were also wholesaling their product to dispensaries so they could decarboxylate at their dispensaries um and they were doing great with that they had a great sales model she's a tremendous entrepreneur she's an attorney she's an advocate for cannabis she's a cancer survivor herself so she had like a very good foothold in the community um but what she wanted she had a vision for this product to take it to the broader cannabis market people like myself we use it recreationally um you know smoking smoke every now and again for just like you drink a glass of wine she wanted to put this product basically in the home of every everyday cannabis user um so essentially going from a b2b model to a much larger b2c market then you were just about to talk about how you were you were continuing to work around so you're building content around holistic medicine not specifically saying marijuana not putting cannabis anywhere near it so go ahead and continue yeah so so for example a example piece of content could be like five holistic ways to reduce stress to reduce anxiety uh engine like a standard listicle article that you'd see like a buzzfeed type thing um and one of those would just be you know thc cannabis so just kind of like again feeding that into there uh so we're making sure to tie the content back to the brand in some way so it's not just talking about something that has no relevance to the brand um so what we were doing was just boosting that organically and if you're good with facebook ads you can get very cheap clicks we're talking about like 10 cents or less to basically again kind of build the authority of the website with facebook algorithm to understand who the audience is who might be interested in this content also just build the remarketing list um and then after that what we do is we start remarketing a conversion based advertisement that would push people for a pdf opt-in like an ebook about decarboxylation so it was basically saying like carboxylation sorry decarboxylation is uh so the machine that i said and i'll follow up with some content so people can can take a look at it themselves um the machine that they were selling ran the process of decarboxylation which is activating the thc and again stop because i'm so close to this topic now it's like second nature to me um but decarboxylation is actually a scientific process that just essentially means the heating of uh the heating of cannabis to activate the thc toasting your pot gotcha exactly it's actually it's actually exactly what it is um so like for example when people make edibles or something like that or again like tinctures or oils and stuff like that they put they basically put into a convectional oven but it wastes a lot of the cannabis because of the heating mechanism so she built a uh like a machine that literally looks like a mason jar metal mason jar um and it activates the cannabis um evenly and distributes the heat properly uh she patented that oh smart so now you're needing you're needing people really to opt in so that you can have a way to communicate with them exactly exactly so so so after we after we kind of um build the audience just through content and just distribute that content we then remarket for conversions to get people off facebook and then once you have their email then you can start to market to them directly in terms of the product and still though what you have to do because you don't want to just generate emails about people who are interested in holistic health you have to be a little bit more specific but you have to be creative with your copy because again you can't necessarily say cannabis decarboxylation you can't say like um stop shouldn't say that anyway um so so you have to be creative with your copy um you know so exchanging words like um exchanging words like um like weed with material for example you know i'm saying so instead of saying we do say material um so just exchanging copy like that both in the advertisement and on the landing page um but the good thing about facebook is that over time as you build up more equity with your ads like if you're running a lot of traffic on facebook and you're running clean ads you're not getting ads shut down facebook will give you a lot of leeway um so once you kind of build up that equity that's why it's important to promote those blog posts um spending money basically to get the algorithm to understand again who your audience is what your page is about um and if you look at it from the point of view too of of generally speaking most holistic people in terms of holistic medicine uh people who are open-minded to different alternative forms of medicine are definitely open to seeing cannabis as a form of like pain relief as opposed to taking like an aspirin or um you know something even worse that a doctor would prescribe um so basically just kind of using the content the out of them to go find people that are in market just very very broad so you do have to spend quite a bit of money uh just to do that audience building but after that then you can remark it with much more specific messaging um and then again once you have that conversion point you can just blast them with emails for whatever you want now you're talking about facebook and i definitely think that's a better choice than linkedin for something like i mean what are your other options like that you're using to adwords people aware kind of yeah adwords is another one because there are quite a quite a bit of people searching for so people who are users and i and i'm a recreational user i i i wouldn't say that i'm a user i'd say more than i'm an advocate for folks that um again i've had some history with cancer in my family and it definitely helps for a lot of people um so uh i've had a very open mind and i'm familiar with the cannabis industry but i still didn't know what decarboxylation was but uh a lot of folks do know what it is and um there's so there's a lot of people searching for decarboxylation um so this will kind of transition i guess into the seo and just kind of google strategy that we did for them so um i'm not sure how familiar people are with seo but um they had a kind of a brand new website and when you don't do a lot of seo for your website you don't have a lot of equity with google so you don't have a lot of authority yeah it was really tough for them to get visibility um so she had this really really good guide on how to decarboxylate cannabis um but there were a lot of major websites like leafly was based like the huffington post of cannabis for like you know i'm saying a big publisher okay about cannabis they had like the top three spots and they were all just like decarboxylation guides uh so we took a two-pronged approach number one is we started doing a lot of just kind of like pr style outreach using her name because she's a cannabis advocate um she's she's just a force she's just a really solid entrepreneur so we did a lot of pr style outreach to get her feature on like the forbes nothing to post and stuff like that to build the overall authority of the website um which over time helped quite a bit in terms of getting the other content on the website more visibility uh but then we actually reached out directly to the leaflets and just offered to sponsor their articles about decarboxylation so we basically sent them an email and said hey um you've got this really good article about d-carb can we sponsor it uh and we did so basically they gave us the author byline on it so it became like a guest post submission by her with her face on it and they also gave us banner ads on that so we were basically jacking the search traffic from that until we were able to end up ranking that article for decarboxylation which they rank for now so cannabis marketing is surprisingly serious you would think you saw a lot of fun and games but it is not yeah i mean yeah it's one of those industries where um how do i say this nicely there's it's kind of a gold rush there's a lot of people who have gotten into over the past couple of years because they're like oh cannabis is legal now like i can make a lot of money but it's a really expensive industry to get into like insanely expensive industry because of all the regulations um so marketing is kind of taking a back seat so while there's a lot of attention on it there's not really a lot of companies who necessarily know what they're doing and i don't mean that as an insult to anyone listening to this um so yeah we had to take a pretty surgical approach in order to get them the visibility again and still working around these kind of blacklisted areas because we couldn't just go to google search we couldn't figure out a way to get around google search like if you um this is back then but we could not get ad words we couldn't pay for the keyword decarboxylation so we didn't have a choice but to figure out the organic the organic play to get the visibility for that keyword um and then the same thing on youtube too like if if if we were to go back and do it over now i would definitely try and figure out a way to get youtube as the work um in my opinion guys are just the most effective way to advertise in the world right now by far um and because there's so much traffic on youtube for cannabis for the carboxylation just based on the keyword search that we did that was another approach that we wanted to push but while we were going through this with them youtube kept on taking down their videos and actually shut down one of their channels which was unfortunate uh again even though they weren't sitting there like smoking bonds they were talking about like the science behind d carb they were talking about the medicine behind um you know how thc can help folks especially those who really need it so they're more of like an advocacy advocacy channel than anything but um youtube didn't care they were taking them down left and right so uh it was tough so we had the the opportunities that we were able to create we had to take full advantage tell me a little bit more about the pr style outreach you did like there are cannabis influencers just like there's every other kind of influencer so how do you identify them and how to complicate a relationship with them so so we use um so our agency my partner i should say um is uh he's based on automation experts sql and python and he built us like a custom crawler that we could identify influencers with i've used a couple of influencer platforms but i find that they're either just the middleman that take a cut on whatever the influencer wants or they're just their inventory is so spammed out because all marketers are using it and hitting up the same people those accounts suck um so what we did is we built our own crawler to scrape instagram and youtube so you want to surface people that other people aren't finding exactly exactly um and also too because as a lot of people know and this is a couple years ago it's even worse now we actually don't do influence influencer marketing anymore i just think it's it's it's not worth it um but basically two years ago which is a long time ago in the school in the grand scheme of these things um even then there were influencers who just wanted too much um you know there's a surprising number of people who have like a million plus followers who are literally i kid you not just doing bomb rips on instagram and getting like tens of millions of views um so yours doesn't get taken down but instagram doesn't care i mean instagram is instagram's out of control especially now um so uh so yeah so basically we just built a crawler we were crawling profiles and then we have a small offshore in the philippines who was just qualifying those uh and just kind of hitting them with different tags in terms of followers uh you know sending them a dm just asking if they'd be interested in you know potentially working with the cannabis company uh we basically put together like a one sheet for them that like talked about what the product did talk about the company talked about the founder um so they knew that we were legitimate we weren't just like some again like this industry is riddled with people again i don't mean this in a disrespectful way but just rid of what people who don't necessarily know they're doing when it comes to marketing uh so we didn't want to waste people's time you know we also wanted to make the most out of our time because we're getting paid for our time so uh so yeah so we were just hitting people up on instagram with just a very basic pitch that said something like um hey so-and-so uh like we love your profile um you know my name is ryan i represent a company called arden uh we're looking to partner up with amazing influencers like yourself uh we have this awesome product if you're interested um you know we can send you a free product in exchange for like a video of you using it like an unboxing video if they had content doing unboxing on their stuff if not then we would just offer them money for straight up for it so basically what we're doing too is we're trying to leverage anyone not just the instagram and youtube side of things uh but also if they had a blog attached to it then we would also just make sure that they did a blog post review that would link back to the site as well so i think that'd be more valuable where you're trying to build organic stuff because you can't really get to it the traditional advertising yeah you know channels yeah exactly like if you hire my agency now we we don't necessarily do influencer outreach anymore because again the amount of work and the amount of costs that it takes to work with an influencer but back then when we were more of kind of a whole we all my agency right now only does seo we won't do facebook ads for any more you know so we just focus on seo so uh back then we were doing more holistic kind of end-to-end marketing so we're looking at it just if you we're killing two birds with one stone we're gonna get you the the say the the brand exposure also some direct sales coming from instagram uh but then also we're gonna have the long term impact of getting a blog post on their website and having that link value for seo so how does that change so you mentioned two years two years you're not doing influencer now do you still have the same challenges you faced when you first went into this two years ago or for this client anyway or is it easier now it's easier now because we know we're up against you know the the first time is always the hardest when you're doing something in new industry um so it's easier now because again i've also learned a lot as a business owner it's really hard to run it's really hard to run an agency that does everything well so we've really doubled down and tripled down in our strengths which is seo and really focusing on that that core process of seo specifically when it comes to certain protocols and now after going through and working with the cannabis company in that industry we know exactly what we're up against so now over time after doing outreach for this company other campus companies we've got a database full of influencers and bloggers um that we can just basically send an email to if we want to link if we want some exposure things along that nature but we're not going through the advertising for campus no so what would you do if you're starting right now today with say like a b2b cannabis type product that you need to market to dispensaries and i would i would say i would say i would say earmark at least two and a half three months of your time to figure out like you have to advertise to get it to get exposure um if you have if you want to turn around sales quickly um organic just takes too long and i sell seo but or if you have no authority if you're just getting started it's just going to take too long so i would say figure out uh i think i do think influencers are still a viable option if you've got the budget to spend and if you're managing it very closely um we didn't have that close with a handle on again because we're mainly focused on the link side of things not the sales side of things but if you need to turn around capital quick the good thing about cannabis influencers is that a lot of them are not getting hit up like a fitness or a fashion influencer would from like a fashion nova brand who's offering them like 10 grand per post again if most people are just sitting there taking bonkers there's not a lot of companies who want to be associated with that but if you are in the cannabis space and if you feel like their audience identifies with yours and you can definitely get some cheap attention off that um and it's still effective so i would say look into influencers i would say figure out how you can leverage social media advertising because again between youtube and facebook ads i still think that it's it's it's the best bet for for any business in the world in terms of generating sales quickly um figure that out figure out how you can navigate the platform figure out how you can get an account that you can baseline and forecast off of again that's not going to be getting shut down every week so focus first on audience building content quality understanding what and i can't tell you this because it's different for every ad account um but you know like i tell everyone like good marketing takes time it takes testing it takes patience and you're going to have to burn some capital to get there but once you've got that figured out um you know it's just like investing in your product for the first couple of months what have you like once you get that figured out then uh you can start to grow and scale what lessons have you taken from the cannabis marketing industry that kind of space that and applied to b2b generally like what's helped you do better with b2b based on your experience in cannabis yeah i mean it's a good question i've always done um i would call like the advertising method that i put up that we put together for them like a funnel right like run top funnel traffic remarket mid funnel conversion point and then at the bottom also remarketing more of like your sales like talk to a sales representative type thing um so it's a it's a it's a model that i've been using for like the last five years with incredible impact for all of my companies um but going through it with the cannabis industry it's since it's so hard and you have to pay so much more attention to it like after going through that refining it whereas before i had a much more kind of like yeah let's just run blog post the interested folks and then let's just remarket off of that like really going through this and understanding how to build content and i think content is always the variable especially now content creative especially with advertising like you have to be building content that your audience cares about you have to um and you have to test that you have to advertise you have to look at the data you have to understand what people are clicking on what people are engaging with how long they're spending on the website how willing they are then after they see that content to opt in off the back of that because with cannabis you're spending so much more money because of all the things that you have to get around that you have to hyper focus on these things so really understanding even more so how to leverage the data how to optimize all parts of the funnel how to really get things dialed in um and then again also just understanding that you don't get that many opportunities and the opportunities that you do get in such a crowded space you've got to make the best and you have to make it's just not an option it's not an option to not make it work you have to make it work you mentioned youtube do you think that podcasting or doing video blogs is that a really beneficial channel for cannabis marketers to use yeah i think it's in any business you know any business i think is it is i just think again if you're going to start a podcast now you really like the first thing i asked you when we got on is who's the audience like you and you answered right away like you have to have your audience style day i i make that mistake i have a podcast and it sucks because i'm basically using my podcast as as the back end i do a lot of video marketing on youtube and i'm just kind of pushing everything in the podcast and nobody listens to it because i don't smile then i'll be the first to admit it well i mean it evolved so i've been doing marketing smarts for like seven years and it definitely evolves you'll see certain segments you know swell and contract and certain episodes attract different types of people so you got to be careful how far you know field you go from the topic you said you were going to talk about so you know right so marketing like cannabis marketing is still marketing we're good but if i was just going to talk about cannabis just generally that i couldn't do that i mean i mean i i think you could but again you just it's just like every business you just really have to understand like who the audience is within your audience like it's not enough to just get on and start talking about cannabis like you you've got to have you've got to have and and i'm not saying that right away i think the first thing that everyone should do is just start you know like take the first step start um and you can like you said you you get it dialed in over time you want to like if you're say i'm a lawyer i don't practice now but i used to so if i wanted to be like a cannabis lawyer then it'd make a lot of sense for me to talk about cannabis actually it's easier to do a podcast about cannabis than it is to talk about law because law is regulated also in a different way that's a little bit harder to do content around so very true yeah i just think just any just to close that off anything that you can do any and like everything will help if you do it the right way um and it's not going to be right the first time it's just again just like the advertising it takes time to get it dialed in are there any challenges with marketing something like cannabis like do you get hate mail from people or you know people like parent groups objecting to you or anything um you know i i fortunately those didn't go to me i was just we were just the marketing agencies they didn't go to me yeah i didn't see that i have somebody else to get out there but but so so so weber says our agency but we also have an seo agency training platform called the blueprint training and we run a lot of traffic a lot of advertising traffic so i get quite a bit of people who comment who dm me who it's but like i'd like you just you just don't care you have to not care it's just i don't care what somebody says like i just don't care if you don't know me then like your opinion doesn't it doesn't faze me and i think everyone has to take that approach and it's unfortunate um especially now i've actually seen an increase because of covet i feel like people are just cooped up they're pissed off they're looking for a fight to pick um and it's easy to fall into that trap like it's happened to me before or someone hits me on the wrong day with just something really nasty and i'm like you know what like i'm gonna go in on you but like it's always helpful take a step back go get a glass of water and be like who cares like it's whatever so yes i'm sure that they got them i get them all the time but it is what it is what would surprise people about b2b marketing in the cannabis space i don't know i mean i guess just the things that i covered in terms of in terms of the regulations but um it's hard but all marketing is hard i've never actually worked in anything in terms of marketing especially now um what surprised me is how similar it is in a lot of ways it's like you're you have obstacles to overcome that maybe are unique but the way that you overcome them is not all that different from how a different more traditional business would have to do agreed i think good marketing good marketing every every campaign that we approach we follow a very similar strategy and process that all revolves around some form of content and creative because ultimately if you want to attract people who have no idea what your business is you can't just put a billboard in front of people anymore you've got to have something of value to them that's going to get them to be like okay like this is this is kind of interesting and then over time you just continuously kind of get back in front of them so i don't i don't think it's different than anything else but again i just think that you have it's it's a lot harder because you're cutting they're cutting off your fingers with what you can do you know um there's just not as many bullets in the chamber for for for what you can do whereas if you're going to come to be with like an e-commerce company that sold sneakers like we can just open it up and do everything um but it's just it's not the same with with cannabis b2b or b2c ryan where can people learn more about you and where can they get more information about webreth uh yeah you can go to webers.org that's our

do is measure out one cup of coliform [Music] alright guys so once you measure out your cooking the wall what you're gonna do now is added to your mason jar [Music] alright guys so now we're going to filter out the cannabis so let's get it to so once you filter out your cannabis put your cooking oil into a new mason jar alright guys my cannabis juice ticking the wall it's now done that you got to watch this video don't forget to Like share and subscribe please [Music]", "oSCTQHCjLzs": "what's happening my true buds family it's good to have you here today if it's your first time tuning in my name's jack i do all types of edibles infusions and tons of other fun content on this channel so be sure to subscribe and check it out and see what's good today i'm answering a question i have gotten a lot how to calculate edible dosage let's dive into it and i assure you my buds it is very simple to figure out you're just going to need a couple pieces of information off the jump how much flour are you using in today's example we're going to be using a half ounce of flour and what is the strength of that flour what's the thc percentage see i'm fortunate i'm just going to read it off the back of here and it gives it to me 23.19 and if you don't know this but maybe you know the strain just going leafly or something look it up find you know the average percentage for that strain and you'll be good to go now that we're doing our example here so i'm doing a half ounce so that's 14 grams no matter the amount of grams you're using you're gonna times it by a thousand because there's a thousand milligrams in every gram so 14 times a thousand equals fourteen thousand five times a thousand equals five thousand and a simple way to remember this kind of bringing me back to grade school here just add three zeros to it so you're using ten grams add three zeros you got ten thousand so today we have fourteen thousand milligrams now i look at the back of this gelato pie here at the 23 percent so i take this 14 000 milligrams times 0.23 equals 3 220 milligrams that is our total thc in this half ounce that will be in our infusion not accounting for burn off or anything we'll get to that in a moment so we have 3 220 milligrams here and we're gonna be infusing this half ounce into one cup of coconut oil i like making my stuff extra strong so we have our infusion let's say it has this full amount we have a cup of coconut oil that has now been infused with three thousand two hundred and twenty milligrams so your recipe calls maybe you're making some no-bake granola bars you're making some cookies or something either way your recipe calls for a quarter cup simply take that three thousand two hundred and twenty divide by four and you're left with 805 milligrams so in that batch let's just say of cookies you're going to have 805 milligrams now let's say you made 10 cookies 805 divided by 10 equals 80 milligrams per cookie there it's really simple about like that and you're good to go now i don't even know why i've been putting off this video just i wrote it down a couple times and i forgot to be honest with you i got a question recently that kind of sparked it in my mind now you might be saying in some of my other videos actually most of my videos i get a lot of trim and shake that's like mixed together from friends that friends give me all this and i don't know the thc percentage so i can't calculate it at all so what do i do i use the t check ii potency tester this thing has been a lifesaver for me while the math you know can give you a pretty basic answer and it's great to know especially you know if you don't have a t check or you can't afford it or whatever it's good to have that math on the back end but like i said i'm using trim and shake i don't know the percentage so when i'm giving people stuff if i didn't have this to test it i would be even more like be careful i'm like be careful when people are taking edibles anyway start slow but this thing has helped me a lot now i'd mentioned something burn off earlier this can happen so there's a potential for some of the thc to burn off when you're decarbing your bud decarboxylation is the process of activating your thc so you're left with an active product you can also do a passive infusion as well but you know you could still have some burn off there so let's say we're doing what i do in most of mine which i decarb so there might be a little burn off there then you put it in your crock pot stove or whatever there might be a little more burn off during the infusion i love using the levo too i doubt there's really any burn off there and then depending how you're making it so say you are making cookies and you're baking them at a certain temperature there is going to be some thc burn off there so that total number of the 80 what did i say 80.5 milligrams per cookie probably won't be that high it'll probably go down a little bit because there will be some burn off now if you made the no bake balls you know that doesn't require going in the oven it might be a little higher these are just little things i wanted to bring up in terms of finding the percentage but it's just a really good baseline to find it like that just total grams times a thousand to get the milligrams times thc percentage and you're good it's worth knowing if you're making your own edibles and it's definitely worth checking out the t-check too as well i'll put that below this thing also text uh test alcohol tinctures it tests olive oil coconut oil butter it even has a flour expansion kit where you can test your flour so maybe if you didn't even know the strain you could test the flour and do it that way but you might as well just test the infusion too so that's that my friends you're having a good day drop a question if you have a question because i'm always curious welcome to the true buds family if it's your first time and if you're already part of the fan you know i love you guys so i'll see you on the next one let's burn one down and uh have a good rest of our day night morning wherever you may live i hope you're doing well and i hope things are going great and i hope this little mathematic equation found you well you", "27dIDqrHsFE": "[Music] hey everybody dr john here with uh extract lab i'm going to be talking today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after guide after guide

channel today we're gonna be making cannabis pills using Keef so let's get into it [Music] so the first tell you what to do is measure out so gravity now as I'll put the kief in a mason jar a little put this in other words for a minimum of 30 minutes [Music] [Music] take a paper cut [Music] something to do stew - just transferred a 1000 [Music] [Music]", "AD3QNMgqgkU": "[Music] first step is to weigh out 3.5 grams of our cannabis flour so you want to break up the cannabis to allow a lot of surface area exposure because otherwise you may not get a full extraction add the cannabis to the canning jar and 1/2 cup of coconut oil now we seal the canning jar very tightly add the canning jar to the boiling water for about 2 hours we're gonna pour this through cheesecloth placed over a metal strainer gather up the cheesecloth and squeeze all the remaining liquid out add the 1 ounce of coconut oil to the 11 ounces of honey add the blended coconut oil and honey mixture to a blender now we

today we will be talking about bugging care by design topical pain cream my hands are actually love are hopefully I didn't come up in the camera but anyway before we get into that [ __ ] a question you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] about look like that please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody this year always saying cuz always [ __ ] me me and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime I post some get and take that ass over to Instagram and follow me I cannot underscore me speaking the Instagram I got my concepts going on right now until January 25th you can win yourself one of these awesome t-shirts it's just the way of saying thank you for me being at a thousand subscribers plus so you can see in a video to see the rules on how to get into there and just make sure you follow all that but get that ass over to Instagram and follow me kind of underscored me so anyway not that [ __ ] out the way let's get into this we got this pang cream and it's a it's a care by design pain cream and it's a one to one with it being a one to one that means that it has equal parts as most of you guys know it's a hundred and fifty milligrams of THC and 150 milligrams of CBD alright so like let's say you have a muscle issue and the reason I know this works is because you know two days two days ago I was at the gym right well if I could don't pull ups doing this thing you know me working on my build and uh I'm on the bar this girl walks up on the side of me badass mexican chick right and I live on her own when the bar I'm like look look cuz you know sideways doing bullying looks like [ __ ] she goes to the machine right on the side of me so I was like man let me throw in the cup wedge to five or six I was at the end of my set when she walks up so I'm throwing action five or so so I do my thing yeah I put my legs up do a couple of fancy little shits I come down and look over she ain't even facing me mom is she doing the exes what hurt back to me I felt like yeah I Steve Harvey would he feel a if I got a family feud and somebody give a weird answer he like what the hell yeah I end up straining my back on the last two exercises like reps I shoulda done so I [ __ ] up on that when trying to impress somebody she wouldn't even [ __ ] looking so anyway my back was triggered so what I did was I had this cream so I was like why not go ahead and try because I honestly never really tried pain creams because I'm really ever in pain to keep it real and if it's I am from working out like a sword I just let that [ __ ] be but this one my muscle was hurting like I felt like a pull on my lower back so how it goes I went on a set [ __ ] it let me go on and use it it's a it's a pump okay so looks basically the same as that bottle you got this big-ass bottle at this little last [ __ ] so I don't understand really the purpose of that but I guess maybe because they got to make it the childproof thing with the pop top it's like a big-ass weed bottle if you ask me oh I'm gonna keep my weed in this [ __ ] so oh let me should I tell you the ingredients in this [ __ ] let's see okay so it's a coconut oil base like most topicals are that MCT coconut oil has aloe vera beeswax shea butter cannabis oil of course orange as the [ __ ] is orange orange essential plants [ __ ] either they're Orange Haley family felt was good or is your central essential oils essential oils also peppermint essential oils and then you got some shed no I can't pronounce that and then I also got the soya lecithin and it also has vitamin E inside of it vitamin E ain't bad to put on your skin [ __ ] not something you want to smell smoke or bait no and you don't want to bait that [ __ ] okay just like you could drink some some Hennessy but you don't want to bake that [ __ ] you know so it's the same thing so that's the ingredients s inside in there and then obviously I could say it's 150 milligrams of THC 150 milligrams the CBD so a really cool thing with this and is the smell it's not super strong so you know like if you are to use like some bangaiore and you walk around this don't do that to you and also don't make you smell like weed so anyway so it does have you do smell it a little bit don't get me wrong but it's not a lot like a super super duper strong smell it's a little watery so don't look at it like you're gonna use it for lotion like I should be cuz my shade is ah so we go see it to do where it has a little get into cracks so anyway that's my son so because some people asked somebody asked me about that like oh you like prints that's not about prints that's my son when he was four he wrote his name and we got a tattoo and a prince was named after the Fresh Prince of bel-air so that's that so you guys know the backstory of that but yeah so anyway I used this cream when I went to work because my lower back was all [ __ ] up and I'll keep it 100 this [ __ ] worked like a [ __ ] like I was good to go with my desk I can make my desk stand and sit for half of the day outstanding half the day I said I was good either way I went with my back for that day and I've had that lower back pain before and I just like gangsta it out yeah I mean hey I getting stood out it was like man I'm gonna let the pain beat and I'm gonna stretch and I'm gonna do some foam roll and i'ma let you know the bubble blah this time I was ironing that time for that [ __ ] I'm on my way to work my back is [ __ ] all the [ __ ] up so let me put this [ __ ] on and I put [ __ ] on and honestly work make sure though you still do your stretching all this is is a mask this didn't fix my [ __ ] muscle it just make it stop hurting so I can get through my day I still have to do my stretching I still did some foam rolling on my ass cheek to release the pressure from the muscle from pulling on my goddamn lower back muscles so you still have to do the things that you need to do to take care of yourself but if you're in a bind and you you know need to use this [ __ ] do it now certain things I say y'all gratis and bangers and [ __ ] you can't work out and make that [ __ ] go away you can't help your diet make your diet help it but you can't work out to make that [ __ ] go away this is something that's dope for that you got knee problems this is something that's dope for that now if you got full bypass if I come in and ask for a cream but I'm like what's hurt and they're like well pretty much my whole body you're not gonna lather up in this [ __ ] [ __ ] so this is more so over like paying targeted areas like I'm targeting my elbow not like my whole left side is [ __ ] like that's not what this [ __ ] is for that route you want to go with edible art in tourism but when you're looking at something just like oh you have wrist problems you have joint problems you got knee problems lower back problems things like that this definitely helps even with the shoulder so I had known people to swear by it but I never had their use for it but when I actually how to use for it and it worked I figured I would share that with you guys so the website is cvd org if I'm not mistaken it doesn't say it on the bottle I should read the bottles before I do videos so I don't know what the [ __ ] website is but as CBD org so definitely go check that [ __ ] out or something like it if you if you live you're in pain and know somebody's last pain it doesn't get you high generally I'd said before that actually this was the cream I had put this cream on my wife's back and she said yeah my back was relaxed when I was up high off [ __ ] night and she had to smoke so it was like they say there's no get UI but if you put enough on that [ __ ] like it against you hi MA okay so I say you know just be mindful that but for the average person an average amount of use it won't get you high I just really overboard I put a gang initiate on that [ __ ] so just keep that in mind when you're using it but outside of that I definitely say this is something to [ __ ] with care by design is really stand up company they also have capsules they have babes they're a really really good company they also do a lot of teachers and their big would ratio so I don't really see them with just straight THC I always see their stuff ratio with a balance of TV THC the CBD from one the ones all the way up to 18 the ones so anyway that's the end of this video plays I'm at this [ __ ] make sure y'all check out the video though on how to get the goddamn t-shirt and go to my Instagram and [ __ ] follow me over there and follow the instructions over there as well alright so I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the love going y'all love each other keep the peace going and there y'all be peaceful to each other I'm out this [ __ ] you [ __ ] up [ __ ] I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smokin", "rUCymABIOps": "[Music] so we're right in the middle of what's being called the green revolution which is the systematic nationwide decriminalization and even legalization of medicinal as well as recreational use of marijuana of cannabis and this is really a radical upheaval of what was historically a very very huge illicit drug trade that involved multiple countries and thousands and thousands of people and literally billions of dollars for a simple plant kind of ridiculous the idea to try to make something like this illegal something you could grow in your backyard but it was done and continues to be done in some jurisdictions and so it's a pretty interesting time billions of dollars are now coming to the mainstream this is now a taxable good which is creating huge huge tax revenues in states like colorado and washington state and all the other places where it's become legalized and then the question is what does this really mean i'm not a marijuana user i'm not a huge advocate of marijuana culture it just doesn't appeal to me at this phase of my life but what i think is pretty interesting is when you have this plant which has been used for thousands of years and has some very interesting elements like cbd which is stands for cannabidiol which is one of many one of dozens of cannabinoids these compounds that are inside of this plant that has some really interesting properties first of all cbd it's important to remember as we get into this discussion is non-psychoactive which means you can take it and you don't get paranoid you don't get the munchies you don't want to watch you know south park episodes until two in the morning that's the end result but it's proven to be really effective for pain anxiety and sleep those are probably the three main things you'll find all kinds of crazy stuff online about it curing cancer and all these kinds of things i don't think there's really clinical data to back that up but pain pain anxiety and sleep constitute a huge percentage of prescription medications not needless to say opioids for example opioid abuse is on the rise and potentially cbd cannabidiol and maybe cbd plus some thc for certain people could be a much much healthier alternative i'm in no way a cannabis activist or anything like that but i'm all for decriminalization of drugs i can't see any good that's come from that there's probably hundreds of thousands of people in jail right now for marijuana possession which just seems crazy entire lives ruined for a plant which is definitely definitely less dangerous and harmful than you know a bottle of vodka or something like that on this week's podcast we'll be chatting about cbd specifically and i just want to emphasize this is non-psychoactive meaning it's not going to get you high and i say this because i know most of you are not interested in getting totally baked on a tuesday night and so i'd like you to think about cbd the the market unfortunately has been flooded with you know network marketing and all kinds of weird pyramid schemes and things and it's really difficult to figure out what cbd is good and what cbd is bad and hopefully we'll shed some light on some products and some ways to think about this especially just making sure that you get an effective dose if you're new here it's the lucas rockwood show i'm a yoga teacher a trainer i'm a serial entrepreneur i'm the father of three kids but first and foremost i'm a student i like to learn stuff so i go into the world and i meet medical doctors like today's guest yoga teachers meditation teachers authors experts and i try to bring their most recent their best thinking to you here on the show so hopefully we get some ideas about how to live a more fulfilled life if you like the show i recently canceled advertising because i found it kind of boring and so instead you can sponsor the show here's how you do it you just share the show on social tag me it's at lucasrockwood if you could leave a rating and review in whatever app you're listening on that would be very helpful last but not least if you have a question for the show send me a direct message on instagram i'm at lucasrockwood i answer all of those messages myself thanks so much for listening enjoy so welcome everybody we're doing a different version of the podcast today and the name of our podcast is cannabis for pain and sleep and i'm joined here with mary clifton who is right here on instagram if you're joining us here and dr clifton is a board-certified licensed internal medical doctor she's an expert in cbd and cannabis which is what we'll be chatting about today her website is cbd and cannabis info.com lots of great resources there she's the author of a couple books one is called the grasses greener and the other is called get wasted and she has a bunch of companion cookbooks and she speaks all over the place and we're happy to have her here again the website is cannabisinfo.com welcome mary great to be here great to connect with you you know i was wondering if we could start off with some uh definitions i've never been able to tell or i don't know if there's a difference between cbd from hemp or cbd from cannabis and i'll tell you sort of my understanding of what hemp versus cannabis is i think of like canadian hemp made for like us yoga people wear hemp clothing and then i think of cannabis as like when i'm in holland they have this crazy sticky bud it is that is there a differentiation to be made between the cbd derived from hemp and that from cannabis you know not really i mean i i think that hemp it differentiates from cannabis in most people's minds or at least in the industry as hemp being cannabis sativa and cannabis indica plants that primarily concentrate cbd or don't really concentrate particular cannabinoids and work really to be very fibery for the development of clothing or ropes or things like that so hemp and hemp is also protected under the farm bills here in the united states so it has a different position as far as its ability to be grown and the restrictions around its growth and then cannabis is also cannabis sativa or cannabis indica but generally those are the ones that grow you know and concentrate thc the cannabinoid that gets you high because remember cbd can't get you high it doesn't have a intoxication effect so having uh so having some uh having the thc concentrate puts it more in the cannabis or marijuana space whereas the hemp space is more for cbd or for uh textiles sure so i i first got interested in cbd i guess it was um nine ten ten years ago i guess it was i was living here in spain and so here in spain it was legal to get cbd coming from holland and so the first cbd oils and things i used came from holland and they definitely had thc in them uh definitely and and it was it was um some of them less some of them more and uh but it it wasn't something that i could just take without thinking about it you know i had a couple of experiences where you know up in the middle of the night paranoid and this kind of thing and i think this is what a lot of people worry about and obviously it's very very different when you're buying things in the netherlands where things are largely unregulated and if you're buying something in north america but for for people purchasing things how should they think about it because a lot of my family's in colorado and there's a lot of people living in states where thc slash cbd strains are you know high cbd strains are legal and these kinds of things for somebody who's like not a cannabis user and is freaked out in some cases appropriately freaked out you can have a really bad night on um how can they think about this if you're making a cbd selection cbd uh it and that is is legal in all 50 states it's available everywhere and you can use it in uh you know safely in all 50 states the only time people get any prosecution or any legal issue with it is if you try to give it to somebody who's under 21 then that's going to raise some flag so if you're using it on a child or you know if you in settings like autism or seizure you just need to make sure you've got all of the right experts around you to keep you safe and protected in that setting but the but cbd that is uh you know sold has to be less than 0.3 percent thc so it can't be intoxicating i mean there may have been some early products that leaned heavily towards cbd and weren't possibly you know properly following the rules but the cbd is is almost always tested every single batch has to be tested and and companies have to throw it out if the thc concentration is too high uh and then and then you know for a lot of situations when i'm taking care of people medically starting out with those cbd products do very well for getting a lot of people under control and then you can add a little bit of thc or a lot of thc depending on what you need to do but most of the time when you're making a cbd selection nowadays if you read the label carefully you shouldn't get into a position where you're getting thc but you're right there are a lot of people that can have sort of a paranoid side effect or a side effect where they get too much energy from using the thc addition or they get too sedated so that's where it's really helpful to have somebody provide a little bit of guidance and support while you're making selections within cannabis um you know when you're using it medicinally or recreationally what's happened to me a couple of times is i've gone to dispensaries we have sort of quasi dispensaries here in spain also and i ask for you know cbd and they say oh we have a high cbd strain it's like yeah i mean maybe it's higher in cbd but this is really it's still a very very psychoactive strain and so um this is this is i guess why i'm bringing it up because many many people live in in decriminalized or legalized states and when they go asking for cbd sometimes they just get high cbd strains which is still i mean that can still take you for a really unpleasant evening if you ingest if somebody accidentally ingests half a gram of high cbd strain or something like that people do really well with a high cbd strain i mean in a lot of cases in almost all cases that's where i start and give people to get the benefit of the cbd and then you know but sometimes in cases where you're dealing with like uh nausea or loss of appetite cancer you need to really get the higher cbd concentrations to get that and to get that treated or lots of you know chronic severe pain syndromes but in a lot of cases a little goes a long way as far as your thc but choosing the pure cbd you know if you have any concerns about thc you can just stay away from the fuller broad spectrum and go with the cbd isolate products and there's a ton of those that have that that go through another level of distillation and any thc that was contained in the product is removed and right now for well for the past five years cbd project products have just been exploding everything from you know cbd smart drinks smoothies face creams everything is is there a quality control issue are some of these ineffective i know like in the supplement industry if you were to buy fish oil or something like that there's a wide range some of that stuff is absolute garbage and some of its medicinal you're going to get a bottle of cbd that has like it'll say 300 milligrams of cbd which seems like a lot except for if you put it into a great big bottle you're talking about maybe 10 mil in 10 milligrams per milliliter so you might have to take three or four milliliters five or six milliliters in a lot of cases before you're getting a result five or six dropper fulls is not something people are going to do they're going to do a couple of drops see how they see how it works maybe go up to a half of uh half of a drop or fold maybe to a full dropper full of work a week later so i mean you know this when you you really have to make sure that when you're selecting a product that you have a product that has enough cbd in it to have an effect because i i do talk to people who say this didn't work on me and it didn't work on my dog either and then oh yeah what did you do with it and they gave themselves you know a couple of drops and then they called it a day and so but they're a lot of times i think that's almost like a prohibition uh concept talking because they're not willing to increase that titration very quickly they're not really willing to move through a process with it so it's a uh so it's a you know it's a it you have to be sort of ready to think about this in a little bit higher administration amounts and be ready to start uh uh you know up tooling it up and so let's assume let's assume people are purchasing liquid cbd oil i'm assuming it's in a carrier oil and what is what is the percentage that they should think about because i think especially when i first started consuming it i used to get uh syringes like a gel and syringe it's just like i just had no idea what the dosage was and i didn't know what was strong concentration what wasn't it was kind of all over the place i think in a lot of cases people start a little too low and they stop before they've given themselves adequate time to get enough to see if it's going to work so i think starting at a at a administrative amount of around 20 milligrams and then going up a lot of my patients settle out between 60 and 100 milligrams a day when they're managing anxiety insomnia pain so there's a lot of those settings where where you can get uh quite a bit done you know at that level um so i usually recommend that people go with a product that has at least 2 000 milligrams in the little dropper bottle okay and sometimes even as much as 3 000 to start because then that way a couple of drops is has the potential to make a difference you know uh and then as you're and then as you're titrating your administrative amount you're not going to have to take dropper full after dropper full so i i those weaker uh amounts are you know sometimes uh i think a little off-putting for people getting started and having a great result you know because who wants to have a mouthful of oil so a little bit is okay but i don't want anybody consuming a bunch of it so i mean so i'm guessing like one to three dollars per day is what people are thinking about if they're dosing right in terms of like actual out-of-pocket expense so similar to like a fish similar to like a fish oil like a high quality fish oil same same kind of price range in terms of i think that's a reasonable amount off the shelf you know if you're if you're in a wholesale relationship then you can probably get that near half yeah and the other i mean the other challenge with anything whether whether it's fish oil or whether it's cbd or whether it's deep breathing or whatever people fall into hyperbole really quickly and so you know the the medicine cures everything from you know ptsd to this and that it's like maybe but from an actual you know from a medical perspective from a clinical efficacy perspective what what what are what are just like i can throw this at the wall and feel pretty comfortable it's going to stick of course there's a bunch of outlying use cases but what are the use cases where you're like this is a pretty safe bet this is going to at least move the needle in terms of benefits well i mean it depends on if you're a lumper or a splitter in medicine you know i mean a lot of what is happening and i don't know that i don't know that phrase tell me what that means some people think that you know every little condition has its own little batch of pathophysiology around it and so they've got everything all split off but i think personally when you get to the bottom of anxiety a lot of eating disorders depression a lot of insomnia all of that is boiling down into dopamine and serotonin regulation and imbalance so when you restore homeostasis to that system you you can manage a lot of different conditions and that's true because when we're managing these conditions in medicine you use antidepressants across a whole spectrum of things that don't actually have to do with depression we use antidepressants to manage chronic pain and that's all serotonin and dopamine so that's where it's so exciting to be able to share a product that balances and restores homeostasis at that neurotransmitter level and the same thing is true when you're dealing with inflammation you know the other pathway that cbd and other cannabinoids are so powerful is in restoring i'm running out of juice restoring balance and homeostasis with inflammation so if you can help to reduce the inflammatory response i mean very acutely in the situation we're dealing with right now if you can decrease the amount of cytokine production and alleviate the cytokine storm reduce tumor necrosis factor in interleukin that reduces fever and body aches and mucus production and you know in one rat model took a group of rats who were like laid out with the rat flu to another group of rats who were pre-treated with cbd who were still eating and drinking and even um even solving a few simple mazes they felt good enough to get up and have a little fun and that's remarkable you know that we can modify the the immune response the inflammation response uh that that way and that powerfully so uh so these are really valuable products and and really our bodies were designed for them i mean you have the endocannabinoid system cb1 receptors all throughout your spinal cord and brain cb2 receptors all throughout your immune system three four and five receptors are located in some very limited places in the brain and probably aren't clinically relevant you know because everything's getting stimulated by cbd or thc at various levels or the other 80 known cannabinoids you know so uh so when you're doing uh when you're thinking about uh you know how is this stuff affecting it's you you have this endocannabinoid system you have these receptors and you have a plant that grows outdoors literally like a weed you know if we weren't in prohibition it would be growing in my ditch it's just you know right well i don't have a ditch you know i'm on the 23rd floor here in manhattan but it'd be growing in somebody's ditch somewhere and then and you'd be able to just use it the animals that you would be consuming would be consuming it and it'd be pollinating the air so you'd always be getting that stabilization and that balance to your system even if you weren't actively inhaling the product the the the whole system is is designed to uh to to work for you so i don't see any reason why you shouldn't view this product as more of an adaptogen like along with your mushrooms and your b complex and your your omega-3 fats all of the things that you're doing to restore that balance in your system and mary everybody i talked to who gets into cbd oil they're always starting to add back in some thc and the theory that i've heard is that you know these cannabinoids work in synergy and we're isolating one of them we don't really know how that works and modern cannabis is jacked up for thc um you know like you said it would be growing in the ditch but definitely it wouldn't be like thai stick growing in the ditch like the stuff that they grow now that this is like this is green crack i mean this stuff is so strong it's so so strong it's it's been it's been hybridized for thc and so you know the stuff that would have been growing native in north america or whatever it's nothing like the dank bud stuff they're selling it's nothing like that um i have a uh insurance connection within the cannabis community that said to me recently i um i eat all of my food organic and all of my cannabis is inorganic because i want it i want it under perfect growing conditions i want the highest concentration of thc and and i want i want a very certain type that can't grow in the ditch but he also you know it will take like one half of one puff he's using what he's trying to do is concentrate the thc so that he's not you know um necessarily getting that much higher but he doesn't have to have that much exposure to the inhalation which is really neat if he can do one inhalation yeah you know so but you're right it does if you're like if you were smoking back in the 70s when we were all kids the 70s and the 80s and you're thinking about getting back into it you know you're absolutely right exercise caution yeah things are a little different nowadays yeah but are you are you of the same school are you of the same school of thought where there there is there are benefits to integrating some thc into a cbd protocol if somebody tolerates it in a lot of cases i i i will add a little thc for patients you know and sometimes even when they're starting with a cbd consultation and we're talking about just adding cbd i'll tell them i really wouldn't spend a lot of time on exclusively cbd given your circumstances people who are having you know end stage cancer uh you know pain or loss of appetite that that's not a cbd uh issue although sometimes there's a decent response but there are certain circumstances where i'd like to go straight to a higher concentration of thc to get those symptoms under control but sure you know a little bit of cbd followed by a lot of cbd so you can see how it's responding for you and then add that shift to thc because in a lot of cases just getting the cbd at a high enough concentration is going to get you what you're looking for when i first started practicing yoga the biggest challenge for me was flexibility i couldn't sit cross-legged on the floor i couldn't extend my arms above my head everything was just so uncomfortable because i was so so stiff and i was in my 20s so my body was fully formed obviously as most of you are it puts you in a very different position if you're an adult and you have major stiffness major imbalance the traditional yoga advice to just keep coming to class for a lot of us is just not enough it's not that it won't work for mobility or flexibility but because a typical yoga class includes strength and balance and breath work and so many other things flexibility is number four number five on the list it'll certainly help but it can often just take way too long or at least that was my assumption if i just kept going on the path that i started back in my 20s i figured it would take me three four maybe five years to be able to cross my legs and sit in a squat and lotus and that was just too depressing i couldn't really accept that so i went on a mission and started researching didn't get a lot of love from my yoga teachers meaning they didn't like this idea of flexibility training so i went to other places martial artists i talked to gymnastics teachers dance practitioners and very quickly i learned it's not that complicated flexibility is not that complicated the way to open your body is through long hold passive stretches it's really uncomfortable it's a process i call gravity yoga i have been teaching this in workshop and class settings now since 2007 and just about a year and a half ago i started certifying teachers in gravity yoga our teachers work with two different types of clients one is they'll work privately to help somebody like a triathlete or a new mother or even somebody who doesn't do any exercise at all but they have an imbalance from working in the service industry or from caring around a kid or whatever it is and then the other way they work with people is within group classes and workshops so one hour guided classes um in some cases two day workshops to help people open their hips their hamstrings their spine and their shoulders those are often the tricky areas and it's been super successful it's really really popular it's one of these things that i thought i was the only one struggling with this but no no no turns out many people every day when they go to put on their shoes are hyper aware of the fact that their hips and their hamstrings are problematically tight and this just isn't just about feeling flexible it's also about taking care of your lower back and taking care of your joints if you can't stand and move in a functional way it can really cause problems imbalances in our body are one of the leading cause of back pain and knee problems even shoulder issues can derive directly from imbalances and this is where gravity yoga comes in i'm telling you this story now because we're about to start our last gravity yoga teacher training program of 2020. it's an amazing program it's 12 days long it's live with me and we'll teach you everything you need to know to work one-on-one or in group settings just so you know most of our graduates now are working virtually via zoom due to the coronavirus end and it's working just as well if not better than before to learn more about the chorus go to gravity yoga training dot com gravity yoga training dot com and you can read stories from past students watch a video from me and see if it's the right thing for you courses starting soon hope you can join us the actual course itself was i just want to give feedback and say it was superbly run the use of modern technology and techniques this feedback system i was not expecting this i was just expecting an email saying with a few bullet points um you guys are really set an example to every training college on how things should be done and i can't commend you enough for that it was money very well spent um and i'll be back for more courses i'm sure so um once again thank you very much i'm very happy now thank you cheers bye this week's nutritional tip comes in response to a listener question listener sally s on instagram says lucas i've noticed you've discontinued your nutritional supplements specifically your green me up super green powder why did you do that and do you have another brand that you could recommend i find some stuff at target but i'm not sure if it's good so we manufactured supplements for over 10 years and i loved manufacturing supplements i'm kind of a supplement nerd but what happened is over the course of the 10 years supplements became really easy to find which is great you can find supplements like you mentioned sally at target you can find really pretty good supplements at target in fact well i've only been in target a couple of times in recent years but last time i was there i saw some pretty good supplements and and so that's why we stopped there just wasn't really a need for it anymore when i first started selling supplements in 2007 many of our listeners many of our subscribers they couldn't find stuff and so it was a really fun thing to be able to do and i like nutrition i like i like putting things together so yes we had a formula called green me up which i also loved it was a really great superfood green powder in terms of do i recommend them yeah i definitely recommend them you know it's especially great when you're traveling to have little superfoods in your bag just because a lot of times the food is kind of lifeless and boring and dull in terms of micronutrients and so it can be a really helpful thing to carry for those of you who are wondering what we're talking about usually these green powders contain things like chlorella and spirulina and barley grass juice extract and other extremely extremely mineral dense micro algaes usually they're micro allergies these things these super green powders that look really really dark green almost purplish that's usually what they contain the gating factor for this is always i this is always my caveat for supplements is your belly and so some of these things will just wreak havoc on your gi system you just can't you just can't eat much of them or you'll end up on the toilet all day but in terms of brands and things like that i i hesitate to do brand recommendations because i don't know these companies come and go and suddenly they're making something great and they switch manufacturers and it's not that great but there are lots of great stuff to find i usually send people to irb like iphone iherb.com great site for buying supplements really great prices and they ship all over the world literally all over the world it's a good place to find stuff but especially if you're traveling i think it's a really great resource if you're at home you know usually if you can have any kind of fresh greens that's going to trump any of those powders but if you don't have access i am certainly a fan hope that helps we have a listener question this week from joseph joseph on instagram says lucas getting into gravity yoga for hip flexibility specifically thanks for that my question is i'm coming off of 10 years in an office we've all switched to remote work now and so i have time to exercise but i'm not sure what to do i have about 18 or 20 pounds to lose will flexibility training help i get some variation of this question pretty regularly joseph so i thought i'd answer this directly and the answer is probably not of all the different things you could experiment with to help with weight loss flexibility training is probably pretty low on the list now it could help with stress and reducing stress it reduces weight loss but that would be a that i feel like that would be pretty much of a stretch if i was to suggest that you know your nightly gravid yoga is going to help with weight loss when you are thinking about weight loss there are things that i think are often overlooked and those are things like sleep and stress mental emotional stress moderation lifestyle balance meal timing carb throttling but none of which involve extreme exercise or extreme calorie counting which is generally thought of as the best practice if you delve into the research around this you'll find really quickly that extreme exercise and extreme dieting is almost always correlated with failure it it has a very very low efficacy rate and the most successful long-term weight loss programs involve moderate to light exercise which would look and feel more like walking the dog i just want to say that out loud so that you know if you're not attracted to extreme exercise if it's not something that you enjoy and it's not something that's safe for your joints depending on where what what age you are and things like this you can be in great shape doing very very moderate things very simple things i encourage you to go back and listen to some of the past shows i have a show called everything i know about weight loss where i share just some of the very very simple high leverage tips that i learned from the years i spent working in the weight loss market and things like this we have a whole number of episodes where we chat about uh weight loss specifically we'll link up in the show notes i appreciate the question thanks for listening to the lucas rockwood show if you enjoy the podcast i have two asks of you number one share the show on social media with your

easy vegan gummy alternative that sets up in minutes and only requires a few ingredients plus whatever cannabis distillate or infused oil that you'd like to use because this recipe is vegan and it's so simple these gummies do have a different consistency from traditional gummies but for those with dietary restrictions it's a great option this recipe is going to use a powder called agar agar or it can be simply shortened to agar this is a powder that you can buy online or from health food stores agar is derived from a type of algae so it's vegan friendly anyway let's get into the process first get all of your ingredients together you'll need one cup of fruit juice this will be the base of your vegan gummies you can use any flavor but in this video i used a tropical mango juice blend you can get creative and use any type of juice that you want and the type of juice you use will determine the flavor and color of your gummies two tablespoons of white sugar or agave syrup this will help to add sweetness 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and this is what gives the gummies their gummy texture liquid or powder lecithin this is an emulsifier which will help to combine your oil-based cannabis concentrate and the juice which is water-based since water and oil don't mix on their own you probably need to use an emulsifier in order to make sure that everything gets mixed well you'll also need an activated cannabis concentrate you can use a cbd oil a thc distillate infused coconut oil just anything that's an activated cannabis concentrate here are the directions in a small saucepan whisk together the fruit juice with sweetener and agar agar powder bring this to a simmer while stirring constantly simmer for 3 minutes while whisking to avoid lumps remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool slightly add in as much or as little cannabis oil as needed i'm adding about 100 milligrams of cbd to this batch and then you'll stir it well use a dropper that comes with your gummy molds to fill the molds with the liquid and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour remove the candies from the molds and enjoy be sure to store remaining gummies in the fridge in an airtight container for up to two weeks discard them if any of the gummies show any signs of mold before two weeks this recipe is so easy anyone can do it if you have a hard time finding a gar powder or lecithin for this recipe we recommend checking with your local health food store or supplement store so there you have it infused vegan alternative gummies at home using just a few ingredients but this is just one way that you can pre-dose your cannabis oil into bite-size little bits and store them in the fridge so then you'll have them there ready for you whenever you want them let us know what you think about this do you like making edibles at home would you ever try this recipe have you tried this recipe let us know what you think in the comments and don't forget to subscribe for more

products hitting store shelves with an exclusive look at what we should expect this October we're joined now by B and M Bloomberg's David George cos you've got a great piece on our website with all of these details but tell us what to expect so Canadians should expect a big laundry list of new products to hit the cannabis store shelves this October when they should be formally legalized a total to be exact of 17 new products and that ranges from concentrates beverages edibles and topicals there's a very long list I'm not going to say what every one of these 17 products are although we have something that you'll see up on our screen right there but this is going to really dramatically increase the scope of the cannabis market here in Ontario and we've been talking about for the past several months on the sluggish start there's been supply shortages there's been issues in terms of retail rollout but now the the actual amount of products we can disclose is going to expand fourfold from what we currently have on the market that's going to be great for producers in terms of sales figures and and the interest generated by that but it's also going to square up the legal market with the illicit market so there's been a lot of discussion how the illicit market the black market is still flourishing but once you're gonna have the same products that the black market already has in place these will be formally regulated you know great hopefully great products that will that we'll be able to squeeze out that black market player and and really generate a lot more revenue for for these cannabis producers I have so many questions please okay the first one is I understand a producer making cannabis and then selling that cannabis but when we're talking about chocolates and candies are the cannabis companies we talk about like all these hot stocks they know how to make chocolate sinan how to make candy they're learning - okay sure and and we've got facilities and they're doing that and they are yeah that's right one example I just want to bring up is Organa Graham which is a Moncton New Brunswick based cannabis producers one of the top ten in Canada and of their their capacity they've hired a specialty kitchen and they're building a special chocolate food processing plant for this particular product to have cannabis infused chocolates hit the market this October and that's just one example can't be growth the biggest cannabis company in the world is putting the finishing touches on their bottling line in Smiths Falls Ontario \u00e1free\u00e1 down in Leamington has a very high-tech automated facility to process a lot of these concentrate materials such as rosin and wax and Shatter descriptions you can read in my story I don't think we have enough time to really describe what each one of these are but but there's going to be the second wave of Canada's products it's going to be very exciting for the industry and now we have a little bit of clarity on what exactly these products are going to be and then what about the marketing like we did all this coverage around what the products could look like when we had legalization and there are some restrictions from the government on what what things can look like they're about candy and chocolate or like we're moving into an area where it's all about the packaging and the colors and the fancy titles what's the balancing act they're like well as it stands a lot of these packaging requirements are going to be that that we see for flour products are going to be set in place for these edibles and extractables nothing's really going to change as far as the proposed draft regulations go you're still going to have a very significant warning label as well as a very you know large warning sign that this is a cannabis product which is going to be bigger than the actual brand itself there is a lot of lobbying going on right now between these producers and the industry and the government to see if there's a middle ground that they can say look we get it we don't want to make sure that these products are going to be marketed to children however you have to be a little bit flexible in terms of how it can actually market this to the Canadian consumer this is a huge thing I think about I mean as much as there's demand for it I do have this fear about you know kids somehow mistaking this stuff the other question I wanted to ask you and I'm serious about this a lot of the CEOs have said they're not cannabis users are they trying these products because if taste is important now with edibles shouldn't they be like seeing if this stuff tastes good isn't that going to be the first thing the people who haven't tried edibles before think about when they're consuming this can of yeah that's tastes good it's like when you're the king and you have like a royal tester to make sure that the soup that you have is employees in there you want to make sure that so these are good so you know it's it's that's a hard question for me to answer I just they're gonna be out there they're gonna talk about how great their product is but if they haven't tried their product so so I did a story a while back for the BNN Bloomberg website we're about two-thirds of Canadian cannabis CEOs actually do use cannabis okay so a lot of that being said every one of these companies also has a very significant Quality Assurance Department where there's someone hired and their only job is to test all the cannabis products out there the company's own as well as their competitors yeah to make sure that their quality is up to stuff and as well that they're you know they're competitors aren't doing better than they are so there are people out there and making sure that what they what they're producing is actually good product I was going to say in fairness like we're talking about Tyson Foods earlier I didn't say does the Tyson's food CEO eat chicken or meat but I'm just curious about it", "gYVRXNlg0es": "new regulations for cannabis edibles and topicals come into play today and this morning we're looking at what that means from a medical perspective to do that we're joined by dr. maria campos doctor thank you so much for being here ok so in terms of ingesting the cannabis in in in the form of an edible how is that different from smoking it or vaping it so the main distinction is in the way it is metabolized and it's psychoactive ingredients so we know that when cannabis is smoked or vaporized it is heated it is converted into Delta 9 THC which is the active ingredient that is transferred from the lungs to the bloodstream and into the brain within a matter of 10 minutes the effects will last about two to three hours whereas with edibles the ingested cannabis has to first be digested by our system and then it has to pass by the liver where it is converted into its active metabolite which is completely different it's called alpha hydroxy THC which is an a more potent and longer-lasting active metabolite so even though the entire process takes about one to two hours the effects are more stronger and they can actually last a - even 12 hours okay so those are the psychoactive effects what about the effects on our biology if it's going through a completely different part of our body in a completely different way what are the health effects of that so we know that for smoking for example there's the inhaled carcinogens the irritants and the carbon monoxide that can enter our lungs and lead to serious respiratory health effects or vaporize cannabis we know that there may be a less from less harmful alternative however we don't still understand its full health effects with edibles there's no carcinogenic effect so many consumers may prefer this method of ingesting it however the risk is more related to the overdosing of cannabis so that was one thing that I read a lot about in the Colorado experiment which was everything was seem to be humming along very very well and yet people didn't know how to how to dose themselves properly with the edibles at all so a lot of children were getting into it that's a separate conversation yes and that takes us back to the way it is metabolized which for people who might be first-time you in those couple first hours where they're not having any in effects they may be tempted to ingest more and then that leads to the more serious adverse effects like paranoia hallucinations psychosis that can last for prolonged periods of time lastly what do we need to know what else do we need to know about this new frontier in legal cannabis so one thing is like you said the public health concern that there is with accidental ingestion by children or even by our pets that you know poses a huge health risk to the population but also the fact that we shouldn't be consuming it with alcohol and that we if we have any other health issues that we shouldn't really be consuming cannabis all

I have been absolutely inundated with\nemails around CBD-infused everything and now I have tried my\nfair share of CBD products, some that I love and some\nthat I don't love as much. But when I found out that\nHungarian facialist, Ildi Pekar launched a CBD facial,\nI knew I had to give it a go. I tried it out, obviously, and spoiler alert:\nit was the most relaxing facial I've ever gotten. But before we get into the nitty gritty, make sure you are subscribed down below Beauty With Mi comes out every Monday at 11 AM. I've done a few stories on CBD in the past,\nbut I wanted to learn from Ildi herself who's been using the ingredient for years. When I got to Ildi's spa\nhere in New York City, we immediately sat down to talk shop. So, I want to ask you all about CBD because obviously I am going to be\ngetting your CBD facial today. So, CBD is a great ingredient,\nCBD is not new, it's been in the market forever. They used them in the '30s,\n'40s for medication. CBD is made for anti-inflammation, so pretty much\neverybody has inflammation and it doesn't matter if it shows\nup in your skin or shows up in your head. So, taking it or putting it on\nyour skin, it has a lot of benefits. You know, a lot of people think\nabout CBD is it's a drug. CBD doesn't necessarily have THC anymore. If you're looking for a CBD product,\nwhat's a good little threshold of how much CBD you should be\nlooking for in a product for it to be working. I recommend to do research on the company. There is, I think there's\na lot of companies that they don't extract the\nplant the right way. They come in different strengths,\nI'm sure you saw 50 milligrams, 250, 500. There's a lot of information\nout there and it's confusing to know how much you should be using. Very confusing, so being just\naround 250, max 500 is fine. If you have kind of chronic illness,\nyou could go above 500. So, I'm about to get your CBD facial. You should feel really, really relaxed,\nyou should feel really calm, you're gonna be a very good\nperson to be around today. Not that I'm ever bad to be\naround any other time, right? They're not saying anything. They're not saying anything, yeah. Once I was clear on what to expect,\nit was time to start the treatment, which Ildi described as more of a full\nbody experience rather than a facial thanks to CBD's ability to\nsoothe and relax muscles. Unlike most treatments, Ildi started\noff by giving me a gentle massage using her CBD-infused massage oil. Then she gave me an optional tincture which Ildi created to allow\nher customers to ingest CBD orally. Wow, that tastes really good. Tastes good? It doesn't taste like bitter at all and I've tried other ones before. Stevia takes that bitterness away,\nso it's easier to swallow it. Then we got to the facial portion\nwhich was pretty standard Ildi started with a gentle cleanse\nand then a nice chemical peel. Once my skin was all exfoliated,\nthough, that's when things got a little weird. Ildi brought out an electrostatic\npolarization machine, handed me this like\nmetallic rod that was meant to ground the electricity in my body, put on these like white glove\nthings and started massaging my body using electricity. The device is designed to send vibrations\nthrough your skin and muscles to improve circulation,\nsoothe muscles, and drain lymph. It felt really strange,\nit didn't hurt at all. I will say, I was nervous\nthat it was gonna hurt. She handed me the metal rod and I was like,\n\"Oh man, this is gonna shock me.\" It didn't at all, it\nactually was super relaxing, a very gentle massage through my body. I just felt vibrations all over and it was a very zen experience. Once Ildi had done a full pass\non my neck, arms, and face, she did a little bit of LED therapy\nand brought out the big gun. Ildi applied a CBD-infused\nmask all over my face and then used oxygenating machine,\nwhich uses negative ion therapy to do everything from relax\nto balance your skin's pH. Now this machine was super weird,\nand it was probably the machine that I was most excited about. It looks like a space helmet. She took this big plastic bubble,\nput it over my face, and told me that it was gonna be pumping oxygen in,\nI was gonna be super relaxed, and I might even have to\nfight the urge to sleep. Once I was in the cocoon,\nshe put on the vibrating gloves again, massaged me more, and I fell into this really deep, beautiful nap. Now I know that I fall asleep in pretty\nmuch every facial that I ever get, but this one was different. It was the most relaxing\nsleep I've ever had in a facial even like in massages. It's really hard to describe because Ildi basically predicted everything that\nI would feel before I felt it. She was like, \"You're gonna feel\nlike you're floating in the bubble, you're gonna feel like your\neyelids are getting heavier, you're gonna start-\nyour speech is gonna get slower.\" She turned on this beautiful\nmusic and the massage was so nice and then, I mean, I started snoring,\nwhich I don't think I do. I've asked my boyfriend many times,\nand he says I don't snore so. But anyway, I woke up after 30 minutes feeling so rested. It was just a really nice way to wake up. It was nice I mean, I don't know. Then Ildi put on some of her skincare just to protect my skin and moisturize, and told me to drink a lot of\nwater, and sent me on my way. I totally agree with Ildi when\nshe says that this facial is more of a full body treatment\nthan it is a true facial. Sure, my skin was definitely\nless puffy, less red, more even after I emerged from the cocoon. But it really was the deep\nsleep and the relaxation, the muscle work that she did\nthat made it so unique to me. Sadly, though, CBD is\nan expensive ingredient. Ildi's facial is not cheap at $400. While it is legal to sell CBD,\napart from making sure that there are appropriate levels\nof THC in the CBD itself, the stuff is largely unregulated. And there's obviously\na huge placebo effect that can happen when you're\nusing products like this. That being said, though,\nthere's a reason why so many people use CBD for everything\nfrom sleeping disorders, to period cramps, to eczema. There's still a long way to\ngo when it comes to CBD in beauty, but it is still an exciting field nonetheless.

Finally someone found me,\nthey went to the hospital, and they said, you have\nperiod cramps, take Advil. (ambient music) - Hi, my name is Sam, and I have PMDD, which stands for premenstrual\ndysphoric disorder. - I'm Laura, and I have endometriosis. - Biggest symptoms that I suffer from the most are mood swings. I can go from zero to\nblackout angry in a second. - Being in pain every day\nreally takes a toll on you. - The most powerful\nchange in public opinion in the past couple of years\nwhen it comes to cannabis has been children with seizures. Sadly, period pain is not\nthat obvious of a problem. It's something that women suffer from usually alone and quietly. - If there is a product out\nthere that can change that, then hell yeah I'm gonna try it. I'll try anything. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] Whoopi, you're on the floor. - Hey, thank you so much\nfor joining us today. First of all, we're just wondering what inspired you and Maya\nto create these products? - [Voiceover] My friend\nRick, who ran High Times, and he was telling me\nabout all of the people who had gotten into the marijuana space, and I said, is anybody doing\nanything in menstrual cramps? And he kinda went, (scoffs) no. And I went, really? He said, no, it's a niche market. It's a niche market that\nhas half the population. We're still doing this? It's kind of shocking. If a guy had these cramps,\nif a guy had this issue, there would be all kinds\nof shit out there for them. This was done in order to\nfind a way to relieve cramps, so please try it, and if it\nworks for you, tell a friend. If it doesn't work for you, not to worry, we'll continue to try to\ncreate something that may. (upbeat music) - So I'm about to start using\nthe Whoopi and Maya products. I'm not looking to get high, just looking for some sweet relief. It's not doing anything yet. Still feel like my uterus\nis trying to murder me. I only truly wish that\nyou could smell this through the camera, because\nthe smell is so good. So I've had it on for a while now, and it feels amazing. It's hard to explain,\nit's like this warm heat all over my abdomen, which of\ncourse, when you have cramps is all you can hope for\nis a built-in heating pad. - Day two of using the products. I took a tablespoon of the chocolate, and was PMSing pretty bad,\nand I went clothes shopping. On days where I usually just\nwant to sit on my couch, eat ice cream and watch Titanic while I sob silently into a\npillow, I bought crop tops. That feels like a victory to me. - I just finished the bath. Truly it was an amazing experience. All the bloated feeling and the pain just kind of melted away. It makes you hella comfortable,\nwhich is pretty much all you can ask for when you\nhave a really bad period. - I use the Tincture today, just did a couple drops in my coffee. Today was a little rough,\nI had one kind of outburst, but again, only one\noutburst, compared to what I can usually do, is pretty solid for me. These products allowed me to exist clearly while helping me maintain\nemotions that I do want to feel. - If you have endometriosis and you're struggling\nlike I am every month, I would absolutely\nrecommend that you try this. I think many women would\nagree that they're willing to try almost anything\nto get the pain away. - [Voiceover] People\nbelieve that you're gonna scratch 'em up because you have PMS, why don't you believe\nthat I'm also in pain? (ambient music)", "faqr7tt-iwQ": "[Music] hey everybody whether you're a patient of ours or not you probably find some of this information helpful what we did was we just compiled a couple of questions that we get you know more often than other questions we get a lot of questions but these are some of the more popular ones and then this relates obviously to if you're a medical marijuana patient or a prospective medical marijuana patient in Florida home so we can only speak for the state that we you know do registrations and final prescriptions and which is which is Florida there you go dr. Jen if you want to read the first question we often have people come in who have a lot of questions and just confusion about the whole process every state does something a little differently so we get a lot of people coming from other states and that was done a certain way and they come here and it's completely different here so but one of the most common questions we get is it's always preceded by I smoked a joint when I was in high school or I smoked once when I was in college is the medical marijuana the same and will it get me high probably the number one question we get and it's not you know you would think easy yes/no question but it's actually not everything's so regulated compared to years ago when you got whatever you got now it's down to the milligram and the percentages and the strength so you can really dial in exactly what works best for you but just an easy yes or no question if you use enough THC yes you will have psychoactive effects yeah and usually so the conditions that we see you know we see people after they've tried CBD from a gas station it it didn't work for them so they need something medical grade the stuff that works is psychoactive period that's the short answer to that if it's gonna help you with ms yeah it's gonna be cycle because the other thing it's competing with you know our host of strong medications right if you want to compete with a host of strong medications including painkillers and everything else you need something psychoactive so that's the short answer for that and in the state of Florida they make us do umbrellas under or like normal or high THC and low THC anything under low THC is consider the CBD product so those are non psychoactive that's the the one answer to this that's know that yeah you can get medical grade CBD with a medical marijuana card and it really just depends on whether or not you know it's gonna work for you we can't tell you if it's gonna work for you because the research is kind of all over the place so it's a trial and error type of system you know you're kind of the patients in control of their own treatment after we registered for the Carter probably the next most common question we get down here in Florida because of all the snow birds and the part-time residents is can I travel with it absolutely not if you're crossing the state line there are two ways actually getting trouble this way one is if you go into airplane where it's federally I guess federal jurisdiction then it's illegal because federally it's still illegal and two if you're in a car you draw across state lines then you have now gone into federal jurisdiction as well so you cannot travel with it even if the next state is okay with it if you're going from Florida to California you have to buy separate products when you're in California so third question is can you grow your own no can i but wait can kids can my buddy grow some and give it to me in like a little baggie but since I have a card for my doctor says I can smoke weed right can I can I can I do that if it is not in the container from a dispensary than it is illegal okay any product that you get has to be in the container received in for it to be legal also there's a real questions that I get and as he was saying earlier when can I grow mine actually not for there's no gray area with that in Florida and all that right now will there be the future maybe but as a right now no laws tend to work really quickly they do as a right now the law is you cannot operate machinery within two hours of using it so just be mindful of all the walls and stuff and grow with it especially if you're one of the patients that you know are brave enough to come out here and get it here in the beginning we're gonna do another video which I'll link up top and that's going to go over the difference between percentages of THC difference between CBD and THC ratios these are all things you're going to see when you go to a dispensary you're gonna see them on the prescription seventy five percent thirty percent one to four nine to one what does this all mean but click the link and I'll explain we did a whole video just to explain that yeah that's for everything else check back with us regularly and we'll keep you updated [Music]", "whOz1rXs25E": "[Music] [Music] [Music]", "_1su4Zt65is": "hey y'all hi here away of goodies and Friday right

separate them so that I can make them pretty close [Music] let's add some color let's do obviously stir stir stir Oh I don't want to add a lot of food coloring cuz you know you get that terrible

air out so our molds are in the freezer you know to harden and now we're gonna melt down our chocolate and our butter these are for chocolate covered strawberries so yeah we know you got a boo thing you wanna surprise give us some chocolate-covered strawberries or if you just want to make them by yourself that's okay - all right that looks good all right let's take that off okay let's do it I've heard so if I have some more white chalk white vanilla wafers Oh which I do have but I don't feel like that one any more down then we could do a fancy little drizzle on it or if you have sprinkles or nuts whatever fancy as strawberries yeah they make perfect gifts which we know first thing yes oh yes we dipped it we made these before and like last year for a friends housewarming yes and they went over very well of course he didn't share them with the guests he hid them away until the guests left what I don't blame them hey good morning yes it is now you don't even need to go to the grocery store and buy those expensive truck will come strawberries y'all cuz it would make the man wax paper and then spray it with a little nonstick spray just for easy removal so we're gonna put these in

crazy wonderful mixed up scary anxiety inducing what the hell quite is this place known as your local dispensary so today we are taking a look at a product that has been uh or a category of products rather that has been kind of up and down in my estimation i find some i really like and find a lot of duds and that is the capsule category uh we are taking a look at buddies today oh boy that uh has quite the reflection buddies soft gels one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand milligrams of thc of course we're not doing on 1 000 like all of our wheats reviews we aim to do 100 milligrams of the thc and review that much of it but a thousand milligrams is quite the uh achievement uh especially for as few as there are there are actually only 20 soft gels in here uh leading to 50 milligrams a capsule if you know you are very simple multiplication um really really excited about this one uh if i can find oh my dog is growling at another dog here she's being kind of a [ __ ] underneath so um so these are as i said very very very strong for a single capsule i'm kind of interested to see what they look like 50 milligrams in a single capsule to me seems very [Music] uh at the limits of what can be done but i don't know you know maybe they figured out some kind of magic um so uh on this buddies package here we've got all our incredible information we want we've even got nutrition facts so one of these soft gels has 6.61 calories in case you want to get that specific 6.61 calories 0.73 grams of fat um so this is a gelatin uh oh it's a glycerin base grapeseed oil uh so it has both some kind of like gelatin glycerin which is some kind of um often glycerin is often used vegetable glycerin is often used uh when making like tinctures uh and then grape seed oil is apparently what they are using uh as their um uh base instead of the more common sort of mct oil you see i don't see grape seed oil very often so 50 milligrams we are gonna do two of these capsules uh and just to ensure that i'm gonna get the best effect i am after i take these capsules going to uh eat some food with a lot of fat content in it just to be sure it gets in the bloodstream in the most uh effective way possible uh and then the other big thing to know about these capsules is their surprising affordability uh buddies i've seen they have quite a few products i've seen um carts from them uh they are sort of partnered with packs i've seen pax pods uh and now of course these um soft gels uh and they're always quite affordable uh these soft gels are no exception soft gels are usually quite expensive um for example like the gold cap which was it used to be a big brand a thousand milligrams of this would have cost you uh well over a hundred bucks uh these were a scant forty eight dollars for a hundred or excuse me a thousand milligram uh capsules a hell of a good deal especially if they are as strong as advertised and then last thing i'll bring up is the lab test results they're on the side um so they do you know show that these have 50.7 milligrams of thc as uh denoted by their lab testings and then of course they give you all the other great manufacturing information on it uh and well let's go ahead and open it up take a look at our very shockingly small soft gels for something that's going to have 50.7 milligrams of thc supposedly there it is um nice looking oil actually a super consistent handsome little tablet capsule soft gel let's get that nomenclature correct so here is apparently 100 milligrams of thc uh i cannot wait to be impressed forgot to bring a beverage with me so you know what just gonna have to dry swallow down the hatch well there we go that's 100 excuse me 101.4 milligrams of thc according to their lab testing results so i'm really interested to see how these are going to fare uh that's going to take me and our custom review wheats review process two hours to find out i'm gonna uh chill out here hope to get quite high as i said eat some nice high fat meal and then two hours from now i'm gonna come right back to you guys here and say hopefully i'm super high well for that we'll all have to find out together see you guys right back here in just a bit [Music] my buddies my buddies my buddies and me i'm pretty sure that was the name of a child's toy from the 80s my buddy it's probably the inspiration for chucky what's not the inspiration for chucky is buddies 1 000 milligram soft gels or in our case one tenth of that 100 milligrams of buddies soft gels um and uh that's where the beginning and end of the similarities to chucky are um in every other way it's distinctively non-chucky-like um it never gets married it doesn't have children it doesn't break the fourth wall um buddies why were we talking about chutty chutties chuckies buddies they're pretty good 100 milligrams um of these uh i wouldn't say it's quite as strong as a um good solid baked edible but i'm not gonna complain that much either um that is the smallest footprint of a thousand mil or excuse me 100 milligrams i think i've ever taken uh and i am uh pleasantly quite high again for something that was so miniscule um and i have nine whole doses left in here uh equivalent size to doses all for uh that very affordable 48 bucks like you're not gonna you know um you're not gonna find ten edibles for that price so that's uh that's a pretty good uh gonna be a pretty good endorsement from me it's not the strongest hundred milligrams i've ever had uh but i am always always looking for things that are going to um pack uh sort of out i'll punch their weight class uh and these tiny again these things are so small uh that is 50 milligrams of thc right there dropped one better not let the dog get that um and uh so yeah very very happy with buddies looking forward to doing uh another nine rounds with them in fact um so i'm gonna give it you know what i'll just go ahead and give it two thumbs up of buddies their thc thousand milligram thought soft gels not the best hundred milligrams i've ever done but again a hell of a value and a tiny little footprint uh so before i go with you guys i mean anytime we do the big old siskel and ebert two thumbs upper uh we want to go and mix our metaphors even further so we want to go ahead and add a little cherry on top some you can sort of mole over think about enjoy watch process during your busy boring days um that is the coronavirus uh you know that you can do with or without weed and this week i want to leave you uh with one of the things that i love hearing the most and um uh and and it can be a bomb for our uh anxious times and that is the phrase uh this x can be a salve for these scary times um just pay attention and anytime there's something that isn't uh people are talking about that isn't scary or is vaguely pleasant you'll hear somebody in inevitably describe it as a bomb or a salve for these anxious scary trying boring uh you know pick your adjective times uh and uh then you get really irritated with it quite quickly so my cherry on top is uh my observation that you're gonna notice people saying an x for y a lot uh that x being a bomb or a south things people never use any other time um so why that seems so uh pertinent now i don't know what also isn't pertinent is this review of buddies thousand milligrams which we did a hundred of thumbs up also thumbs up this phrase which is um a a tincture for our a highly uh friction something something world um i failed to come up with another one wow this went on for a while buddies really great boy this one off the rails in the best way possible thank you so much for watching it's been great stay high stay healthy really do stay healthy and we'll see you guys on a later review also stay high goodbye", "29hyb2rrrgo": "and Marley how do you like your treats did you have any like reservations about giving them CBD at first I was desperate to keep him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "qqvJOAV7oAc": "it was 2012 at the age of 12 that you then became one of a very very exclusive club one that you never want to get into one in seven billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating story it was so happy that you're here and healthy good luck with the diner he wants to he wants to open his own vegan American an apprenticeship as a chef then you know please who would not want to the boy in seven billion yes you",

will explain what you can use cannabis oil for how you can use it and what the benefits are of cannabis oil made in cold methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank you for watching you [Music]", "FSdjvEnyRzk": "what you're watching right now is mark zarlor committing a crime that helps his daughter who cannot help herself 17 years ago Christie's art ler gave birth to twin girls Keely her twin came home first and then three days later Cara followed her and they began the difficult years long task of learning how to treat Cara's cerebral palsy and severe autism this is an anti-psychotic there are antipsychotics and enzymes and sleep aids but few things helped fight off the worst of her symptoms that could sometimes go on for hours pretty much on a daily basis we have some sort of episode when it's heating up I turn off the fan I have a level eighth of a teaspoon when Mark found the one thing that could stop his daughter he made this video to show the world it takes six deep breaths and a father's dedication [Music] let me up okay [Music] are the videos the truth right that's typical of what we see a neighbor first suggested years ago that cannabis could ease Kara's symptoms mark then found that by grinding marijuana buds and heating them to 410 degrees Fahrenheit it created an immediate rescue response to his Donner's most violent behavior and by 10 she's usually back out here enjoying annoying life again for several years we were in fear of using it trying it giving it to her having it but now there is no fear for those artless who risked everything by posting the video of mark illegally treating Kara that more than 12,000 people have seen and by talking to us I just I got to the point where we looked at the law and said the law is not going to change unless somebody Gamble's in his post mark asks the Texans call their state senators demanding a public hearing on Senate bill 269 it would expand the access of patients with debilitating illnesses to use medical marijuana for Kara that law could make moments of calm come legally and if showing what works for her puts mark in jail so be it [Music] just saying if we want to make a difference for ourselves and for you know other kids like Cara we just hit somebody has to take the risk he's another father who'll do anything for his daughter [Music]", "KzUueRahygs": "what's up everybody welcome to my channel today we're gonna be talking a bit about cannabinoid ratios and what they mean but before that we got to get elevated so let's go ahead and build up this half gram aces high from grass roots super stinky frosty beautiful looking bud nicely trimmed so I'm gonna grind that up hold it up nice got a nice pungent odor to it nice and frosty not too much Keith comes after me but but it's all stuff to the leaf flower ten steamed broccoli mmm it's got this really great diesel skunky earthy taste but both parents being diesel they should have called it super DS order double diesel instead of Aces High a super pungent great taste little diesel little earthy skunky hopefully you guys are joining me if so let me know what you're talking about okay so 22 one CBD if you had a strain that has let's say 20% CBD that means it would have 1% THC if you had 50 50 % CBD you would have 2.5 percent THC okay so that's just sort unning you a ratio of what it is from one to the other usually it's a CBD ratio but sometimes there are some strains that have more of a THC to CBD so you have to look at the label and you're not allowed in Illinois's you're not allowed to grab the product before you purchase it but you can always ask them to let you look at the label and they'll be able to put it on the counter or just hold it for you while you look at the label and you can see the actual percentages on there and compare them but this is just telling you the ratio so if it was a ten to one and you had let's say 30 percent CBD this would have three percent THC and that goes for edibles as well anything or everything THC CBD again if it was reversed and it was a more of a seat THC stronger strain that it would be the other way around instead of it being 30 percent CBD would be 32 percent THC and then three percent CBD okay so if you had 50% CBD you would have five and th see now 4 to 1 4 to 1 ratio if you had 10 let's do 20% CBD you'd have 5% th see again if it's a THC to CBD ratio instead of a CBD to th e ratio you just flip that around so this instead of it being 20% CBD would be 20% THC 5% CBD if you have 40% CBD you would have 10 percent THC now one to one is just an equal amount 50% if you had it's a stream of 50 percent C with D it would have 50 percent th see if you had 15 percent CBD we'd have 15 percent th see so again if it was reversed if it was a high C ah THC higher then it would be it'd be the same for this one but in these here would you just flip it around setup CBD here but we th see and then CBD here now you see on something like this you see it one gram or a thousand milliliters a thousand milligrams but it if you look here it only has CBD 729 milligrams in THC sixty-nine milligrams for a total of eight hundred and twenty eight milligrams cannabinoids not 1000 milligrams so that's the second part of this that'll be in a second video so don't forget subscribe so you don't miss out on that part of the big so if you have a twenty to one or similar CBD to THC and it's a high CBD with very little THC if you have a say 10 to one or somewhere around there 10 to 1 CBD to THC that's again still high CBD with low THC if you have closer to a 4 to 1 CBD to THC that's still again high CBD and but you're getting closer to a medium THC level if you have a 2 to 1 or a 1 to 1 that's more balanced obviously 1 to 1 is a equal ratio 2 to 1 CBD to THC is a twice as much CBD as it is THC but still more balanced normally with the high CBD to low THC strain you don't get as much of the effect from the THC just due to the fact that it's low THC and there's also studies out that say that CBD combats the psychoactive effects of THC they have a lot of strains out that are produced or crossbred just so that they can reach this 20 to 1 or 10 to 1 ratio CBD to THC but in oils like our a soul or edibles you can control that yourself by putting in more of one CBD strain and less of one THC strain or vice versa less of a CBD strain more of a THC depending on what type of cannabinoids you want to consume now just because you have a one-to-one ratio doesn't mean the numbers are gonna exactly match up you may have one to one CBD the THC and they'll have 10% CBD but that doesn't mean it's gonna have 10 percent THC could have a little bit lesser little bit more maybe 8 percent maybe 11% seem you know all for one ten to one it's not an exact amount so if you have four to one and you have 20% CBD that doesn't mean that you're gonna have five percent THC you may have four percent you may have six percent or if you had 22% CBD that doesn't mean you're gonna have five percent THC again it could be a little bit more little bit less well that's about it for this part of the bed you guys there's a second part hopefully you guys learned a little bit with me here don't forget like subscribe and comment if you want hope you're having a great day smoking off some good broccoli happy token", "lK2pxyo3R8Y": "hi there I'm Mandy Lee the host of try this and try this is an educational show that is all about cannabis and cannabis products every Thursday we share with you how to videos and product reviews and much more to ultimately help you get the most value from our favorite plant and today we have for you for tips on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures so let's get to it let's dive in and let's try this now tinctures are extracted cannabinoids which are mixed into either an alcohol glycerin or coconut oil solution and they're ideal for people who are using cannabis for medicinal reasons or for people who are new to cannabis as well there's a few reasons for this one is that they're administered via a syringe so you're able to easily and accurately dose yourself in really small increments because you can basically count each drop as you administer it also the tinctures come in many non psychoactive options and they also carry little to no smell and involve no vapor or smoke now the most popular and beneficial way of taking them is sublingually so the solution is absorbed in the body through the oral mucus all and to do this you use a dropper and you place the cannabis solution right underneath your tongue you hold it there for about a minute before swallowing and then you will feel the effects typically in about fifteen to thirty minutes and the last you for about three to four hours this way of administering it the cannabinoids and the terpenes they're absorbed through the tissue lining into your bloodstream so this increases the bioavailability of the cannabinoids so if this is the method that you're interested in then here are four tips for you on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures now number one is specific cannabinoid options so when it comes to tinctures many people don't realize that there are many options pass the sativa indica and hybrid options that they're used to tinctures can be made with specific cannabinoids and some with different ratios of one two one three two one or twenty two one of a combination of cannabinoids to meet different patient's needs because each cannabinoid is known for helping to treat different symptoms and ailments and can cause different effects so you can find teachers that are in THC which is psychoactive CBD which is non psychoactive THC and CBD a which is the acid form of THC and CBD before it's exposed to heat and both of these are they're fairly new cannabinoids to be offered and studied their non psycho active but there are astounding results that have been discovered with patients who are using these cannabinoids for an assortment of different reasons number two is using whole plant tinctures from flower so here at green flower we tend to favor whole plant tinctures from flower as opposed to trim now the flowers are just the most cannabinoids and terpenoids aplan whereas the trim it doesn't have as many terpenes and it mostly has the cannabinoid THC in it so these types of tinctures they'll give you the fullest entourage effect from cannabis and provide you with the widest range of terpenes now the cannabinoids and terpenoids resides and with some trim only tinctures you just lose quite a bit of the medicinal value from this lack of a rich terpene profile so when entourage effect is present in many of these flower rich tinctures what happens is you have multiple cannabinoids and chirping that are present and they work together to enhance the medicinal value of each of their individual properties now number three is choosing alcohol extractions so we also tend to favor tinctures that are made from an alcohol extraction process since this process it's just the gentlest on the plant and so it keeps the terpenes more intact because some extraction processes they strip the terpenes from the cannabis and other ones like co2 break apart the bonds between the cannabis and the terpenes and then they reintroduce the terpenes then ultimately what we've seen is that when you keep the terpenes completely intact with the cannabis that's when you'll see the best benefits and the terpenes make the benefits of the cannabinoids even more effective in your system and they carry a bunch of medicinal value themselves as well now Alison Attell from treat well which is a leading cannabis tincture company here in California she said that with alcohol extractions she's seen that with her clients and patients that they're not building up a tolerance to the cannabis so they're able to use less cannabis to achieve the exact results that they need which is a really big plus number four is choose products with testing and proper labels so when you're purchasing tinctures there are a few that you want to make sure to look for and to favor you want to make sure that the bottle itself says how many total milligrams of THC and other cannabinoids are also present in it as well as how many milligrams are in each dropper otherwise you're not going to be able to accurately and safely dose yourself and then we also recommend checking the company's website before purchasing to make sure that the cannabis teacher that you're purchasing has been lab tested for things like molds and pesticides and consistency potency and residual solvent now if you are interested in learning even more

happens to be non-intoxicating it's a clear liquid known as cbd sometimes it is added into various multivitamins or supplements and sometimes foodstuffs that is permissible because it is not intoxicating at all so that's the cbd in fact it has a lot of health benefits it actually boosts your immune system and can fight certain diseases perhaps the homeopaths might tell you more about it the experts of it if you read up about the benefits of cbd oil and cbd extract of marijuana or weed in arabic known as or in some of the african languages known as subhanallah so there is an extract you can get from it that is non-intoxicating and extremely beneficial that's the cbd but what about the thc well the thc is also an extract of the weed but it happens to be slightly intoxicating sometimes a little bit more does it have any benefits any medicinal benefits my brothers and sisters the medicinal benefits of thc are known you can read up on them you will actually be surprised people have been cured from cancer a lot of people have had their tumors eradicated many people have been cured of epileptic fits that have been happening to them for years on end and that is by the correct use of the thc in extremely small doses together with a disciplined diet but you need to learn about it there is medicinal benefit in the extracts of weed and like i said the cbd no question about it the thc only when absolutely necessary for some of the diseases and you would need to contact a homeopathic doctor or perhaps an expert in weed subhanallah some of the doctors the normal medicinal doctors may not even approve of it they might not even know about it some of them would acknowledge yeah you know it does have some benefit i know of people who have been cured like i said but let me make it clear my brothers and sisters the social smoking of weed is not allowed it's not allowed my brothers and sisters i you know what it does have an element of intoxication and if it's done for social purposes it is totally prohibited the hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam clearly says that which intoxicates you in large quantities even a small quantity of it is prohibited so the social use of it is not allowed medicinal use of it if it is really needed and it has been prescribed by someone who's an expert then yes it may be used so remember this my brothers and sisters i hope i've clarified it spoken about three things the cbd being okay because it's non-intoxicating very beneficial extremely good for your health immune booster but when it comes to the thc you remember it's only administered to those who need it as a medication for some serious sickness or illness or disease cancer some tumors etc it does help to be honest with you it has had that effect on so many people alhamdulillah but once again the social use no not allowed so let's not think oh wow weed is legalized just like cigarettes are legalized alcohol is legalized that is a secular legalization or the legalization in your country that doesn't run by the the rules and regulations of allah so even if it may be legal in your country doesn't mean that from an islamic perspective it is allowed or legal may allah wa ta'ala grant us goodness and understanding and may allah help us all those of you who might be hooked on to it it is still considered a drug islam and get off it inshallah we not not just wean yourself off it but just get off it really to be honest you must try your best to move out of these bad habits because ultimately they would harm you uh i want to say once again that for medicinal purposes it is it does have a scope of permissibility protect us to [Music] you", "nBlBahN72YY": "[Music] hey out here in Cali visiting checking out some of the dispensaries and stuff out here I picked up this mystery baking company new canvas infused green apple strips there's a hundred milligrams in the whole bag and each piece is about ten milligrams so here you go right here nice little strip ten milligrams in here so since there's only 10 milligrams per piece and only 100 milligrams in the bag I kind of got to eat like the whole bag to get an effect which since I have a high tolerance this product is not the best for me it tastes delicious it's an awesome taste I love eating them but it just as imprudent enough if you're new to cannabis and cannabis edibles then this might be a nice one for you because it tastes good it's only ten milligrams for anyone that's accustomed to taking in cannabis not the best option go with something a little stronger not saying this company's bad just this product is not the best for someone that has a high tolerance so that's my review on the cannabis infused gummy strips by mystery baking company 100 milligrams and whole bag ten milligrams apiece not a huge fan tastes delicious though they taste they taste awesome they're so good I love eating them they just don't really give me the effect that I want", "1HAaXDwohvo": "[Music] hello friends welcome to week 2 the marijuana edible reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are taking a look at another product from delta-9 i reviewed one of their products before they are classic chocolate and I loved it it knocked me off my feet knocked me flat what a wonderful product so I am super super super excited for the second delta-9 review for their salted caramel I don't know if I mentioned this on the back last time so this is rated by SC labs so you know it's actually got the 240 milligrams of THC they promise and they also say that a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this product will go to cancer research so how cool is that so you can eat a little less guilt free knowing that some of your least money there is gonna go to cancer research so it comes in this triangle-shaped packaging here kind of weird kind of odd shape but that's okay it tasted pretty good last time and it got me really [ __ ] up so that's the most important part but this is the first time you ever tuned into a wheats review before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this bad boy in front of you

coconut oil so I'm going to be using roughly 50 milliliters cannabis infused open at all you can use butter if you want to but cannabis oil is actually the best type of fat be used to make edible add the marshmallows now you just want to miss the marshmallows with we're gonna add some vanilla extract to once your marshmallows this all the way melted then add your expiration now mix everything together so Ashley how to different mason jars full of cannabis infused oil the difference between these two is the time that I actually had my cannabis infused with the coconut oil so for this one here I only need it for flowers but this one right here with seven hours so this was just going to be more potent so I'm gonna actually use this one here to use my chocolate so as far as the measurements I'm gonna be using roughly about 2 ounce cannabis infused I'm going to wait until my chocolate is completely metal before I had to Kennedy's penis Cup on the ornament remember too much he can actually kill the publishing over here now we're gonna put it into this pan alright someone let this go for a little bit and then I'm going to add my chocolate to it and then what's that my chocolate I'm a hat the second layer without the rice krispie treats and then I'm add the remaining chocolate to it so this is going to be very potent alright we've been about 10 minutes so now my hat my chocolate to it alright so I've been over five minutes so now we're gonna have your last layer try to spread out the rice all right so now I'm gonna let this sit for about five minutes and then we can have a layer of chocolate on top of this [Music] so what I'm actually doing right now is I'm going to leave one side without the infuse chocolate and then I'm gonna have one side with it so the left side is going to weigh more foam than the right side all right so my rice krispies treats is now it's done so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like subscribe share peace

everyone or Saturday no it's it's Sunday for you now cuz you're seeing this on Sunday but or I mean maybe Monday or whatever day of the week it is today I'm gonna take a bunch of weed pills and see what happens I've taken thirteen before one time but it wasn't it wasn't these ones the ones that I made before when I took thirteen weren't nearly as potent as these these ones I used more reclaim than those other ones if you guys want to see how I make my reclaim pills I have a youtube video up just go to my profile and you can find it so I make reclaim or THC caps with reclaim these ones are pretty strong probably around 60 milligrams each maybe a tiny bit more I'm gonna take six of them right now I normally take two and when I take two I get pretty blazed and a lot of the times often take two and then I'll take two more so on I'm taking four in a day but you know spaced out and then that'll Holly not need to smoke as much because I'll be pre placed throughout the day enough I'm trying to be or whatever so today we'll see what happens if I take six so let's say that let's start taking these I'm really really bad at taking weed pills um just cuz they're fat I mean these pills are you it's [ __ ] hard you miss okay though we'll get to it look into it one we're drinking a mango smoothie by the way right here mangoes help you get more lick if you eat mangoes 30 to 45 minutes before getting late these pills probably gonna take longer than that to kick in but still mangoes I love them what you guys might witness me choke right here in this YouTube video cuz really better taking pills you know we to Ithaca okay number three going in okay gone down easy so far number I think it's the smoothie honestly a thicker consistency drink makes it really easy to swallow fat pills for me number four down the hatch up to number five I did not drink quite enough somebody knew that but it's doing down it's just fine the last but not least not least goodness gracious number six Cheers I almost got that one stuck in my throat but we're good six pills down the hatch a YouTube video though I feel like from me wouldn't be complete without at least a DAB so I'm swiping the wheel off of my fingers they just these ones have a little bit of oil on the outside just cuz I found sitting here for so long sometimes they leak a tiny bit instead did YouTube video for me wouldn't be complete without an ice dam but I'm not yours Emma do you want to die right now all right we're gonna do a dab right now then I was gonna say I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it now or wait like a little bit but then it took a weed pill while ago so I feel like once that starts kicking in she probably won't want to dab so it's perfect timing to take it down right now I'll heat it up and let's get it got that well you know what I feel like I hit the creation in the last YouTube video didn't bring my last video on Instagram last video on Instagram was at that pen in nature let's go for it the konk studios burning tube here nicely clean ready friend Aloha I don't know why I have a feeling that while recording this video the storage on my phone is gonna run out I just have a feeling we'll see so if it randomly cuts out yours like wait a minute this video doesn't seem quite right it's probably because my phone died not my phone dialing my phone ran out of storage recording in 4k 60 frames per second takes up an incredible amount of storage no [ __ ] big files so yeah what I do normally is all I record a video and then I have to edit it right in Adobe Premiere is what I use it's on the phone it's really great for editing for videos like that elissa we're at 5 minutes in 20 seconds so we've got like 6 minutes and 30 seconds will be about damn time so then I'll go and edit it and once I edit and get the full video then it saves again in my phone so it's like I have the footage twice so it's just an insane amount of sort so I've been going back and kind of deleting the extra videos and stuff so we're good on that I actually forgot to grab dams hey babe do you think you could grab some dabs um we have 30 seconds and some papaya and lime warp would be lit gonna go six minutes in oh no I think I said six minutes and thirty seconds tonight in the recording yeah okay as usually I'm not ready at all whew sorry about that babe knows like I just feel everyone else okay going in on the dab cheers everyone might be a tiny bit let's have I mean I need to be here I'm not sure Wow definitely didn't sorry I'll get you're good you did it was my apology long and okay here hit that up really interesting on the temp there but still nice now holy [ __ ] I'm gonna be so glazed when these weed pills kick in oh and we interesting to see what we end up doing today probably some streaming on Twitch yeah some art maybe will be will try to make some music [ __ ] yeah well I'll check back in um and like an hour maybe I'll check in every hour on these weed pills and let you guys know how it's going I think every 30 minutes okay okay every 30 minutes we'll do a quick clip until I start feeling them and they'll tell you guys a little bit more about what's going on so yeah I'll start a timer catch you guys in a sec when I check back in in 30 minutes yeah all right Chiefs it's been thirty minutes actually 35 minutes we just finished some yoga um I mean we took that dab right before so I can't say that I'm baked from the six pills yet but I was laughing while doing that yoga because I was farting a lot yoga always makes me fart I don't know what it is [Laughter] yeah it's all the stretching and stuff so I had the giggles I was like what's this because of the weed pills like you know what I don't think so but my stomach started hurting maybe like 15 minutes after I took the weed pills but it's because I hadn't really eaten much except that mango smoothie right and so I ate a Nature Valley bar and now I feel phenomenal but I mean it's like 2:30 now so I should probably eat some lunch you know actual fat meal you know what I'm saying before these weed pills really start kicking in is what I'm thinking so yeah I think that's next up on the plate is making some food maybe some potatoes oh yeah it's settled making potatoes I'll show you guys what I make alright it has now been 1 hour as you can tell via my eyeballs I'm starting to feel it it took 6 weed pills I haven't dabbed in just about an hour so I could be mine early lit still from that last time for sure for sure but I am NOT just mine early let you see realized pretty nicely blazed right now we'll check back in on another 30 and see if they're fully kicked in and whatnot what's going on I got my eyeballs and they're pretty red right now so see if they get redder if I get more lit we're not thinking about it I feel like thinking about how that I am makes me realize that I am indeed quite blazed already see where it goes see you in 30 peace alright checking in haven't made the potatoes yet it's been at least another 30 or so minutes I need to make the potatoes now and then it's like what type of potatoes are you gonna make I was you're good I'm blazed the pills are working and yeah I got a little cardio in so that was nice you know warm up the metabolism to get the pills going even more so yeah ok let's check back in in 30 minutes or actually I'll check back in when these potatoes are ready which will be 30 minutes we're checking that's like a blanket to see it's like it looks like a blanket but it's a jacket it's like psych Oh underwear with it two things all right so it's been another 30 minutes the potatoes are cut up I haven't seasoned them yet because I was checking my canvas which is freshly rezoned what are you judging how much you think I'm lid off of based off of that's what I thought this is literally reflective now I can reflect a traffic light like oh it's green no I'm just kidding I don't think that's the thing look good at that this one's available on our website links down below alright we're now four hours in since I took the pills and I am blazed I forgot to take I'm so blazed I forgot to take a video of the food I literally just ate a ton of

highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "xPHfRtfZnyI": "- Hello, my name is Volkar. I have been involved in\nthe cannabis industries since about 2007. There has always been\nabout smoking the stuff and getting high. However there's a whole\ndifferent side to cannabis and that's the medicinal side. I never really believed in it until when my mum started to take CBD oil. She has arthritis-like symptoms. Let's talk to mum herself. Please welcome my mum. Hey mum, thank you for being here with us. We wanted to ask you a few\nquestions about your CBD oil. - Hello, yes, we can do that. - Okay, why are you using it? - Because day in and day\nout I was in terrible pain and couldn't get relief from pain pills. The pain was always there. And of course, that burdened me a lot. - What kind of pain was it? - It's a pain in the joints. The whole body was stiff. My ability to move became worse and worse and I was getting desperate. - And in the past you used\npainkillers I believe? - Yes I used painkillers, one in the morning and one in the evening. And I've been using a\nrheumatism medication. - And then you started using\nCBD oil and what happened then? - I take one drop in the morning\nand it lasts the whole day, and I'm much more flexible. Everything is much easier,\nmuch more pleasant. And in the evening I take two drops, which makes the night\ncalm and I can sleep well. - Okay and we also wanna\nsay that you work in H Care and you work a lot with doctors and pharmaceutical medicines. You know a little bit\nabout this stuff, right? - Yes I think I know my way around. I just sat over everything\nand took the drops. I have now reported to the doctors that I'm taking these drops, and the reaction is zero. I have a feeling that the\ndoctors think that this is great, but they are not willing to prescribe it. So I got this privately. - And does it make you high? Or is it addictive? - No, not at all. This oil just makes my pain\ngo away, and nothing more. I have been taking this one\ndrop for weeks and months now, and I have not had to increase the dose. - Can you show us the\noil that you're using? - I think you can't go\nwrong with one drop anyway. - And were you able to\nstop using the painkillers? - Yes I have stopped\ntaking the painkillers and I'm using much less\nrheumatoid medication. - Okay, thank you very much and I'm gonna put this in our video and I hope this will help other people who have similar symptoms like you. - Yeah, maybe this can\nencourage other people to get in there and take CBD oil too. - Thank you very much. (foreign language) - Now there is a problem with CBD oil because at the moment\nthere is kind of a hype. There are thousands and thousands\nof products on the market, many of them are really bad. For example it happened to\nus that we bought CBD oil, the taste was horrible and\nthere was virtually no effect. The best way to buy CBD oil depends on the country you live in. In the USA, you now have service providers who test CBD products for effectiveness. This website here, they test products for\nCBD content and quality. The advantage is that you\ncan be sure that the value that is given on these bottles are true. I am going to show you two\nproducts that I recommend. This stuff is what I\nknow worked for my mom. So it is safe for arthritis problems. I would also try this stuff here. This is a full spectrum oil, that means it has not only CBD, but it also has these terpenes in there. So if you wanna imagine an\norchestra that plays music. If you wanna have a nice song, you will need many different instruments. I think this is the new way to go. In the future, all oils will\nbe full spectrum like this. There are different concentrations of oil and you wanna start with\na low concentration. You can see here, 125mg, 250, 500, 1000. There is such thing as tolerance, and if you start off\nwith just the highest, most concentrated oil, then you have no room to go upwards. You wanna start with a low dose first. So for example, the 250mg. If at some point you get tolerant to it, you can use it a bit more often and you can also use a higher concentrate. If you live in Europe, things\nare a little bit different. I have experience buying\nCBD oil over there, and I'm going to recommend you the product that we have\nbought and that we know works. It's called Candropharm100, from this website called cbdoilkaufen.de. The link is under this video. So there you go. If you haven't tried CBD oil yet, give it a go, because it may help with\npainful conditions you have. The link for products\nare under this video. Thanks for watching and\nI hope to see you soon.", "8Yq86bip74U": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today I'm going to talk to you about the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse bomb the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse bomb is the purse friendly portable topical CBD supplement that you can bring with you anywhere that comes in two sizes a half an ounce 150 milligram cats eyes and a ounce and a half 450 milligrams size Charlotte's Web recommends that these products be used to help to enhance your overall quality of life and wellness I love to use them to help me recover from exercise and normal aches and pains but before we go any further make sure you like and subscribe to this channel Charlotte's Web is a US company based out of Colorado and I like to think of them as kind of like the mama to CBD companies because they have been growing and manufacturing CBD supplements since 2011 they do have facilities that are C GMP certified which is basically telling you it's like the same thing as a pharmaceutical grade compounding facility and they are US hemp authorities certified they do use organic farming principles but they are not certified organic and this product is non-gmo and vegan friendly and also contains no preservatives and only uses natural products like essential oils and botanicals to help bring about a nice pleasantly scented topical ointment that contains a fair amount of CBD so now let's talk about what you get when you purchase the Charlotte's Web him infuse CBD bomb there is 300 milligrams of CBD per ounce in the bone and currently there are two sizes that you can get this half an ounce which I actually really prefer to carry fits easily inside the palm of your hand you can slide it into your back pocket or throw it into your purse and they also have the 450 milligrams which is a little bit bigger it still fits in your palm but it's a little bit harder to fit in to the back pocket it does come in a metal container and it is originally wrapped with cellophane you will find that it's a very durable product and it's not super easy to come off so that's why I love to have it like for the pocket and the purse but could do keep that in mind if you tend to have stiff fingers or you maybe have trouble with that dexterity I love it because my kids struggle to open it up just a little bit but for like my father-in-law he kind of struggles sometimes to get this off just a bit the hemp infused balm is lightly scented with essential oils I basically really only sell smell clove and maybe a little bit of a mint flavor it is very lightly scented and they only use essential oils but because it is scented I wanted to let you know in case you do have sensitivities to things like smells they do use a natural emulsifier like shea butter and sunflower oil as the carrier and it is in two different sizes this half an ounce in the 1.5 ounce currently you can get these products in Canada US Brazil and in select retailers over in the UK based on what their inventory levels are and they do have test results available but from this QR code located on the back of both containers now if you have watched a few of my reviews you may have noticed that I have had quite a bit of a beef with the Charlotte's Web how do I say this CoA or their disclosure of their analysis they don't necessarily make it the easiest thing in the world for you to find the test results you can you scan this QR code and then you have to find the batch number and that for these containers is actually stamped on the side so this is D 28 and this one is L 0 1 so once you scan the QR code you actually have to type that number into the search function and then you'll get to the COA results but here's where I'm eating a little bit of crow from the time that I did the review on the capsules and now the two different cos are completely different now the Charlotte's Web cos contain the full cannabinoid profile so these show that you have both CBD CBD a CB G and CBC unfortunately it did not test for CB n but you will also find that the test results showed that it passed for there are no traces or load limited to non detectable amounts of pesticides and microbials which means basically that these guys although they are not certified organic they're not using pesticides and I love that because I don't want to put anything else that could damage or injure me long-term and I love knowing that that I can find that with the co ace now let's talk about what it's like when you actually use the Charlotte's Web him infuse bomb so you have to kind of screw it off which we've talked about and you'll notice that it's a slightly yellow the kind of waxy look I kind of compare it to like my my husband's chapstick if you will as you rub your finger on it you'll notice that it starts to melt on your hands and you'll also notice that it kind of goes on a little bit almost like wet or waxy feeling that thickness does stay on top of the skin for a few minutes but I feel like it helps to give your skin the ability to have extra time to absorb it but keep in mind if you're putting this on you might want to wait a little bit before putting your clothes on it because I wouldn't want you to have like an oil residue stain on it it does have a very light scent which I absolutely love and you will find that you start to notice the benefits of the supplement within about a half an hour I would say 20 minutes to a half an hour is when I start to notice that the absence of the severity of any residual pain that I have so let's talk about the top three reasons why you should use the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse balm first of all I think it smells pretty lovely second of all it goes on very easily you can basically put it on anywhere that ails yeah I'm putting it on my net because I'm a little bit stiff today and within about a half an hour I'm gonna start to notice that the muscles on my neck are gonna start to relax and it's it feels like the inflammation is going down because of the CBD and other natural substances that they add into the product I also love the fact that this stuff comes in fairly affordably in terms of a topical CBD product this is a really great way to test out a CBD product especially if you're new because it's a very convenient size and it is very very affordable the things that you might want to keep in mind when you are purchasing a topical supplement is that although this is a very durable container it can be somewhat difficult if you have stiff hands or stiff fingers or a loss of dexterity of any sort it can be a little bit tricky the other thing to keep in mind is although I find the scent very pleasant if you are sensitive to essential oils or since in general this does have a smell to it so if you get triggered like with headaches or whatever definitely keep that in mind as well when you're looking for this looking at this supplement so let me summarize everything we've talked about and one little little present with a bow on it the value that you get with the Charlotte's Web hemp infused balm is a fairly concentrated topical product that contains no preservatives it is organic it is non-gmo and vegan friendly the Charlotte's Web company does certify cGMP and they are US hip Authority certified so you know you're getting a very good quality product it is lightly scented with essential oils and this one container the smaller 150 size does last quite a while this stuff has a little bit goes a long way but keep in mind it can be somewhat difficult to open if you have a little bit of loss of dexterity or stiffness and fingers and because it does contain essential oils there the the cent factor so if you're sensitive to that keep that in mind as well it does come in very affordably priced especially for this lower concentrated the 150 size the half and outside so it's very affordable but it could be somewhat difficult to open up I absolutely love it and I think you will too have you tried it let me know leave some comments down below and let me know if you've tried the hemp infused balm or if you've tried another Charlotte's Web product I would love to know what your results were like my name is Jennifer Dixon again I'm with green valley nation and make sure you like and subscribe to this channel so you can stay up to

Denver coming back at you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "ORCdvawQ69w": "but

__ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like

last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just

__ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well

"Go3jQdaLQXA": "keys everybody I'm your friend marijuana max for years I've been teaching things about growing oil and different things water here's another one well we are what max makes sad well marijuana max makes ginger - such a big freakin deal okay here's what happened why I am made sad which brunet give him a quick go down on what do you think of the sad oh it's very nice it soothes it suits better than anything I've ever had it suits how many other different marijuana sizes and he tried about three about three different kinds yeah this was the best okay um I think it's more than three but let's go with this that wasn't me man and the reason I had to make sad this because I had some oil and it was four years old and I loved his smoke on it was very viscous and it started getting to the point finally where I was wanting to make some food out of it but instead of grabbing me Everclear to meet in strata I accidentally grabbed the ISO and so I had to make an ISO product base and then I used coconut oil to mix it in with real simple penises want you mix in a lotion or this or that thank you basic and simple coconut with a coconut cream oil coconut oil that's organic extra virgin coat a big old [ __ ] tub it's not too expensive okay let me take the oil you mixed it with ISL which makes it into a liquidy base and you mix it with the coconut oil all kind of mix it good you use a blender I you have to use my hand and just round it up the toes next up and then by that time I was viscous I poured it into here and then put it for sure now the same thing goes with making it easier simply these tensors that they're putting in food they're taking really crappy low grade stuff you can take a gram you know oil mix it with Everclear say ten to one and shake it up really good and you have yourself one hell of a texture use five dollars or five grams 0.2 0.5 holy [ __ ] twenties five point five which is one-half of a drop or four that on your in your drink on your food or something give you a nice buzz use more than that you hang it high you know you [ __ ] can drop before the law you know whatever you need but I'm just saying one dropper flow is going to be sufficient which brings us to make an oil today and it's lots of pretty oil help the cake to do or yeah I have one big piece or you see how I'm using the parchment paper I am getting it all up thank you sure you know one get as much as I can I'm just such a Jew I might be or so cheap but just trying to be frugal not be wasteful of all the oil on there and so I can see you're being crazy so if I got more than that it's also helpful to tape it all up to when you're grabbing it and you don't get it all over your fingers this parchment paper and you can do what you want with it but now it has to sit out and I put it in a jar but this is kind of a lot so the laughing good job anyways folks I say that you should vote to legalize marijuana getting involved in voting to legalize marijuana make sure you shave I don't shave coming here I'm gonna do a video anyhow what can I say well I can tell you more but that's about it for today vt LM", "AL5czpfn_jM": "everyone nice to see you all here for the weekly show towards the future as we talk about important topics from today's world and how they proceed how we proceed into the future so this is the third episode my name is autumn Assad elf for those of you who don't know me I am a motivator and coach to help people live a better life through natural means and hard work and just dedicating yourself to fulfilling your your dreams so this is the third episode as I said and we've talked about let's see what have we talked about the first episode was about veganism and animal cruelty and genetically modified animals episode 2 was about scare tactics that are used to promote flu the flu medicine and the complete denial of natural medicine and then there was also this episode now where we're talking about CBD and THC and hemp and marijuana and the cannabis plant and its healing properties that it has there are many healing properties of this plant and many of us may have misconceptions about it I know I sure had misconceptions about this plant when I first you know when I first heard about it because we all have an idea in our mind it's it's for people who are going to be stoners people who are just going to do it just to get high and I was very very wrong about that and I'm sure many other people you know I'm not sure how many of you watching this right now may have that idea that is certainly a part of it which we will discuss but that's not the whole the whole thing here and you know I myself I don't agree with that I don't agree with people who were you know recreational use of a marijuana that's not where I'm coming from here that's not what we're discussing today that's not the point of this because I do not agree with that I do not believe in that that is not money that is not a place that I'm coming from however I do come from a place of natural medicine in ways of healing the body and this has been one of the most healing plants that there is to help with all sorts of conditions it has been able to help with chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia such as what I've had I'll struggle with the pain chronic pain and fatigue and all of that and it's been greatly beneficial to me and it's helped me and then it gave been able to help with anxiety and depression and various cancers as well and we're talk a little bit about some of the research into this as well as you know just weight things that are perhaps preventing this from being the number one tool of helping people okay perfect okay so I do have oh thank you so much Iraq I'm grieve arey thankful for your generous donation Thank You Yuri you're like the most a little blower person you decide to do that like every time I'm very very thankful so yes thank you so so much so I have a variety of articles we will be discussing they're all linked down in the description so yes we will be discussing that oh very okay perfect but a little bit of an issue there so if you have any questions feel free to ask them and I will answer them at the end of the show and we will proceed from from there okay and the first one specifically is really very good here which is that hemp is now legal huge for the CBD industry so this was something that recently passed just over like the past month which legalizing hemp to be produced and grown in the United States normally hemp products would had a imported from overseas so this was a a very very good good thing here so it's claimed to let soothe anxiety stress pain and insomnia without getting consumers high so yes that is let us discuss that CBD and THC two very different compounds CBD is the more relaxing aspect that may help with certain conditions whereas THC is the psychoactive that's what it essentially will have that effect of making making you high okay and that's what a lot of people think of but it's very um there's much more to it than adjust that and if I'm sure you've seen I'm sure probably most of you are seeing at least if you live here in the United States I know I stand all the time now if you go into a grocery store if you go somewhere you see all the time now CBD products there's so many CBD products now oh my gosh so we have moisturizers lattes vitamins cookies gummies teas beer ice cream massage oils and dog treats and that's just to name a few there are so so so many so many products now that have hemp that's made of hemp or has CBD in it and I have a few products here that I'm going to show you in just a minute that I that I have because officer of me I bought a lot of products now with hemp in it it's not necessarily always see me day but so we have here that say president Trump's signed into law the farm bill which contain a provision legalizing hemp a species of cannabis that CBD can be extracted from but that isn't psychoactive so yes it's able to be grown in the u.s. so if this hemp has been illegal to sell or grow in the u.s. ello it's illegal to buy it's legal to buy from international sources so because of that you they can now grow in the United States which is great and of course you know you could pretty much do that in states that legalized marijuana as it as it was but it's not across across the board there so here is where we comes quite a gray area and kind of a bit confusing oops the Drug Enforcement Administration classifies CBD as illegal although it doesn't go after anyone using or possessing it and it hasn't said if it will reclassify a CBD now that hemp is illegal food and drug administration still considers it a drug and therefore categorizes it as illegal to be put in food and/or health products without its approval so companies have to get approval in order to sell you CBD products this is the interesting thing here because you can buy CBD online you can obtain it legally it may should ship to all 50 states here in the United States but it's saying here you know it's it is technically illegal it's classified as illegal and this is where it's just so confusing for me because if CBD and usually anything from marijuana would be illegal so CBD or THC extracted from marijuana that's technically what would be the illegal aspect but if it's from hemp that's a different category but as you can see here what saying is you know even CBD from hemp the CBD in general regardless of where it's sourced is illegal and that's which is so confusing or form a because you hear so many people using this and you can buy it you can buy it in stores I can go to my grocery store and they have it there I can buy it over over the counter I don't need to show my you know ID that I'm over you know a tenner you PI have to be over 18 anyway don't really buy any anything but you know that that's not required so you can just pick it up and there's so many things now that has this so again it's that is it really illegal are they really saying that it's illegal it's it's very very confusing there selling unapproved products without substance abstention at therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law but also can put patients at your at risk as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective so yes the thing is any kind of company that sells you a product usually any type of natural remedy they can't make the claim for sure that it helps with any kind of condition so if you buy something that's supposed to naturally help with anxiety you will see a warning label on there says these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA FDA has already started cracking down a company selling CBD products sending them warning letters in late December so we're just talking a month ago now getting warning warning letters here in December so we'll see how this proceeds forward I really would not want to see CBD being classified as illegal because it has helped for many people myself included okay so here is where is also interesting because hemp has hemp is usually not used as a drug it is marijuana that issues as a drug but the thing is hemp has usually less than 0.3 percent THC which as we just talked about THC is the psychoactive component is what gives you that high effect okay whereas hemp is naturally low in THC as 0.3% or less and I think that is the legal limit that that they can sell so when they're selling you in oil if it has over that limit it's it's illegal to a sell to you whereas if it's less than that limit it's fine and I'll tell you this right now and pretty much every single CBD oil and company that you buy from we'll have THC in it except for one which we were discussed in just a minute because they are a wonderful affiliate of mine and they have zero THC in it which we will discuss once we get to the end of this article yes that's very very exciting I'm excited to show you that okay so since 1970s the controlled substance act has categorize all forms of cannabis plant hemp included as a schedule 1 drug schedule 1 is the most you know the highest tier drug at the that there is it is is that what it is the most dangerous I by I believe I believe that that's how it goes making it illegal to grow in so many to form so we're talking about you know if something is that dangerous and illegal here it must be pretty bad right it must it must cause a lot of issues with people right well we will see in just a moment that that is not the case at all and as we can see here in the in the u.s. it is legal for recreation use in ten states and for medical use in 33 states so in a majority of the states in in in the United States you can obtain it for medical reasons now why could you obtain it for medical reasons if it's in a legal drug that has Schedule one drug is classified as a substance that has no medical benefit if it's being used by in 33 states for medical benefits you see the problem there is it's not really adding up okay CBD indices sells about three hundred and fifty million dollars worth of products last year and expected to hit 1 billion by 2020 so we're talking about a huge huge business here it really is isn't it it's a huge huge business industry and exports are also skeptical about these claims researchers have even called the CBD boom a forest comparing it to a snake oil scam so of course researchers are going to classify this as a scam because well we're saying just a minute because you can't patent it you can't say I created this substance that's going to help people and I have these scientific research claims of it helping people so I'm sure you're wondering then what is this product what are these products that I have that are a CBD so let me assure you these products here I have a lot of CBD related products I have this vegan hemp balm it's a hemp and everything no CBDs via the Mary hemp stirs okay it's lip balm I also have it's it's downstairs I have body wash that is hemp um I do not have shampoo that is hemp yet I also have this hemp muscle cream body you know as essential oils and have some a stunt I need to buy a buy more I have a lot of a lot of products there also consume hemp seeds every day you know I just every effort every every everything is him unfortunately this is not empty I wish it was they'd be perfect actually I can make an empty because I have a partner partner here a joy organics brand and they are an affiliate of a mine and you there is a link right in the description if you would like to check out their products you can save 10% on their products if you use the code aut 10 now here is why I decided to partner with them because there's so many I get so many requests about partnering with CBD companies like I get requests all the time CBD company new coming CBD company help us promote your products and and this and that they they want me to promote their products a lot of these CBD companies they all seem the same they all make their website look nice and fantasy and they make these claims but they're just the same claims as any other CBD company this company truly is different in that they have zero THC now why is that so interesting because there really is I've never found any other brand that has zero THC in it this has zero so when I mean zero I mean that point three percent that was usually in hemp they take that out of this so that is why it's like oh this is really interesting now they also came out recently with a skincare line so be sure to check that out as well and we even did the founder and I joy Smith we even did a I interviewed her here if you have not seen this yet natural pain anxiety relief with CBD hemp oil so yes they are an affiliate here as you can say Jew organics save 10% if you use that code and there is the URL now another interesting product from them that I recently tried was their VAP product so the VAP product this as join I discussed in that interview this is the most effective way of getting this the CBD into your body many people have misconceptions about VAP because you see a lot of commercials online about VAP inhaling nicotine and you know carcinogens and and and this and that and that's not what this is this is just pure CBD pretty much and honestly this is so fascinating is this is like the the purest CBD that I that I have found vape wise because let me actually show you if I go to their website here okay and they have a variety of products that you can get I usually get the the tincture because that is the most high on them okay I can't really seem to zoom in on that unfortunately there yeah okay so the tincture product that's like the biggest one that I can stand behind because usually as someone who doesn't consume any animal products that is the one that doesn't have any animal products and there's so many other ones do some of the other ones might not have the most natural ingredients but that one that one certainly does okay so certainly be able to check that out but regarding the via vape here let me show you this so the ingredients usually have like a propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin in it and this one a dozen if you look at the ingredients right here hopefully you can see that so just coconut oil CBD and the the hemp oil and then the the fruit plant extracts which is very interesting as I've never seen anything like like that so pretty much pretty much all all you have to do with it it's just okay so it doesn't really take much to be able to do that and I'm not sure if you saw that but I don't really used much of it but this is technically the most efficient way so if that's something that you're looking for they do have this and you can get it if you already have like actual pen base here and they do have just the cartridge that you can get okay and as I said you can save on it if you use the code aut ten on their website but anyway moving on now if we go to the next article here so what is the difference then between CBD and THC so as we mentioned these products here these are CBD products CBD is legal THC is the psychoactive component that makes you high okay so what is the difference then you know why is why does one if they both come from the same plan here why does one have what different properties do they have let's take a look so as we can see CBD is primarily in extractions from hemp whereas THC is the main psychoactive component in marijuana so hemp and marijuana they are like the same plant but they're they're are slightly different species there okay whether they like the same species but hopefully you understand what I'm getting at so hemp is naturally low in THC and naturally higher in CBD th marijuana on the other hand is naturally higher in THC okay that's not to say that certain strains of marijuana can be high in CBD because they can breed it that way but overall when people say that they're taking marijuana it generally means the high in THC kind okay this let's take a look at what's some of these benefits and things are in the differences okay okay so both CBD and THC oh wait I also wanted to mention also now I after after the interview that join I did with this I know a lot of you were really interested in this product I know a lot of you I've checked it out and purchased it and I'm curious to know anyone who's watching right now did you buy this product and if so how did it work for you I'm very curious to know because as I said this is the product that I go to now I've used many many CBD oils and that one is the best and I would certainly say even taste wise it is the best so that is the new one that I'm sticking with I'm just curious about all of all of you okay anyway both CBD and THC are chemically similar to our body's own endocannabinoids this allows them to interact with your cannibal cannabinoid receptors so that's what makes these products so beneficial and and healing because they're interacting with our own body's way of our own body's receptors that's not adding anything anything to it it's fixing what's already in our body it's helping our body you know regulate these these receptors that are already in our body okay they're already there so let's take a look CBD versus THC psychoactive component CBD is a non psychoactive so if you're worried about getting high CBD is not going to get you high okay THC binds with the cannibal cb1 receptor in the brain it produces the high so it's the THC specifically that produces this high effect but CBD binds very weakly if at all to the CBD one receptor in fact it can interfere with the binding of THC and dampen the psychoactive effect so if you're trying to get high from THC and you take high high-cbd you can actually lower that psychoactive effect that you're feeling from the THC legality it still remains illegal federally so even though certain states may say it's it's it's used for you can use it recreationally yeah you can use it of recreationally then it's still illegal federally and I've just taken a quick look here Lucas um it's CBD heal anxiety problems yes CBD can be very beneficial with anxiety because it helps promote relaxation I believe I do have a I think that the article that I have is about depression but you can also apply to anxiety because it helps relax the body it helps the body be able to regulate those emotional states better and to not react you know over-the-top it it helps regulate those emotions and it can be active it can be used as a sedative as well so it can help help you sleep it can it can help you relax and not get so worried and anxious about things like if you ever noticed like some of the people who you know with smoked marijuana and they're you know they just they don't have a care in in the world you know we're not talking about those there was a STONER people but that gives you a bit of an idea of some of the benefit that it Mehta may be able to offer you because it can help you not care as much about oh this this thing is coming up I have something coming up oh I'm just terrified I'm so oh I'm on edge it'll help you take that edge off and be able to relax by allowing your body to do what it's meant to do by interacting with your own body's receptors here are some of the benefits here so that actually leads right into as you can see the benefits we were just talking about this CBD is used to help with various conditions so seizures inflammation pain psychosis or mental disorders inflammatory bowel disease nausea migraines depression and anxiety so many things this this can help and then there is a whole article right here so Lucas if you are really interested in this take a look at this health line article and then just click on the anxiety and bring this up CBD for anxiety it will tell you all about it as it is it is absolutely incredible as I said I have used it and it has been great greatly beneficial now what about THC what is the benefits of of that so that can also help with with pain muscle spasms glaucoma so sometimes you're here like older people have got come on you know you know take marijuana and that will help so that is that is it's the THC that'll be able to help insomnia low appetite so I'm sure we know that some people who take pic take marijuana like they have they have the munchies they're so hungry all the time right so it can help you with low appetite if you have low appetite and it will be able to help now I'll tell you this it certainly does I wouldn't say it increases my appetite but it does help I think with digestion because I don't feel as full or as long or I don't have those stomach issues that I may have if I didn't take it okay so it does help a lot with that and it can help with nausea so if you're feeling nauseous about something just take some of that oil and swallow it down amazing amazing it really is as well as anxiety and again a lot of these can can be both pretty much like pretty much all the things here may also apply to CBD okay but still did there are some components of CBD and THC that will help other help more than in others the side effects so what are the side effects then let's take a look the CBD is well tolerated even in large doses yes you can pretty much take take this is like a thousand milligrams right here okay you can pretty much drink this whole bottle and probably not have any negative side effects whatsoever now the thing is if you take too much really not you're really not going to enhance the effect either is there there is a certain dosage recommendation and you have to figure out what your body needs the most okay our bodies are all designed differently so that's a you know a serving size is one dropper and it has 33 milligrams of CBD I'll say why I don't take that a much I take PI half that amount every a day okay so I take maybe about 15 milligrams of CBD and that's spread throughout the day okay so I'll take you know five milligrams three times a day of this oil okay I put it under under my tongue and that's like the second best way to absorb it after the vape okay so that may be the most therapeutic dose for me 15 milligrams a day you may notice 15 million milligrams a day it's not cutting it I need a lot higher dose or maybe 15 milligrams is too strong maybe you only need 5 milligrams a day so you have to determine what is best for you and that's why I always recommend the oil because you can dose it so if I only want a few drops I only can I can do a few drops well if I buy a pill I can't determine just how much you know I'm getting I have a pill that's like 25 milligrams oh I don't want all that said I'm saying so that's up to you what what do you think would a be it'd be best i T okay so here is other side effects of THC high THC use may be connected to long-term negative psychiatric effects which is especially true for adolescents who consume large amounts of THC so yes if you're if you're young and you're taking and you're smoking marijuana like every day and you're you know ingesting you know not necessary esting but you're getting all this smoke this a THC into your body then you're really risking sick psychiatric disorders in the future and as you can see uses this compound increases the risk of some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia so it is very true so as I said if if you are young and you were using THC you were you know smoking marijuana quite frequently then you do have a much higher chance of developing schizophrenia so that's why I say you know if you're going to do that if you're going to use that recreational use which you know many kids are I mean there were very few kids who use it on therapeutically but it can be used very therapeutically which we would discuss in just a moment then you're definitely risking your mental state when you're an adult if you're a child and you're in and you're doing that and as I said I do not support recreational use of marijuana I do not support the use of using this substance that's meant to be a healing substance for something that is essentially escapism and trying to you know get home and you know know know if none of that none of that I do not agree with that so drug testing so I'm sure we know if we're applying for like a job they drug test us so what's up with that with THC and CBD let's take a look so both THC and CBD can show up in drug tests for days or weeks after you use them so for some people that may be a bit risky there but here's the thing most standard drug tests only look for THC I don't know of any company that would say let's check your TA let's check your CBD to see if you're getting high because CBD is not going to make you high so it doesn't make sense for them to test that and here's the thing hemp can produce some THC in addition to CBD but as as we just discuss joy organics brand has no THC so if you are really concerned about that certainly look into that company I definitely recommend that because the thing is if you are consuming CBD oil and you're consuming it very high doses and you will have some THC if you're not using a brand such as your organics that has zero THC so that may show up on your drug court reports it's just like when people will ingest poppy seeds and then they would test positive for opiates because it's the same it's the same chemical there they said I'm saying so you had to be careful marijuana has a higher higher concentration of THC whereas hemp has a higher concentration of CBD yes we discussed that so here is some me okay so we have here a chart CBD produces a high no but THC does illegal both of these yes yes and if we look both CBD and THC or leak illegal federally I however some states have laws that make them legal for medical or recreational purposes or both and as you said you can buy CBD online you can have it shipped to you so I really don't see what is illegal about that side-effects almost none whereas THC has psychoactive side effects shows on drug test yes for CBD but that's only because it has trace amounts of THC unless you're buying from a brand that has zero THC pain reliever and pretty much yes for all of these increases appetite so if the CBD no as I said I've kind of had some effect from that I know some other people I've had some effect from that but it's most it is more the THC that will increase your appetite decreases seizures yes for Afra CBD CBD is very very very very good chance of decreasing seizures I don't really know much about THC hoping with Caesar's okay so that is that so what's going here let's see what about antidepressants and CBD well take a look at this this is a study in a in a rat model cannabidiol also known as CBD I'd say long-lasting antidepressant effects in rodents so this is not a human stay this is a rodent study but it can give you a bit of an idea a substance found in cannabis maybe faster acting antidepressant than conventional medication hmm a natural medication that's better than pharmaceuticals that humans create interesting okay tell me more cannabidiol CBD induces sub substained antidepressant like effects and mice assassinating everyone and again you can look at all these articles for yourself in the description CBD increased animals resilience and stress models of depression thus indicating an antidepressant lake effect this effect developed with rapidly within one hour and remained for a week after a single administration which is not the case for conventional antidepressants Wow so this one dose of this could really last quite a while so you'd maybe don't even need it every day again just listen to what what your body says about the product CBDs effects were associated with increased release of neuro nephron brain-derived neurotropic factor B D and F in limbic brain regions that are often associated with depression development so when prevents your body it prevents your mind from developing these depressive episodes but unlike antidepressants it does not cause a chemical imbalance in your brain because antidepressants are thought to correct a chemical imbalance despite the fact that there was no evidence to show that antidepressants really do anything of the sort or that depression is even caused by a chemical imbalance which I have covered that in a previous video but CBD will not cause you to have a chemical imbalance because antidepressants do cause that chemical imbalance effect because the whole model is that you have a chemical imbalance here are some drugs to fix that chemical imbalance but it's not imbalance in the first place okay CBD promotes fast neuro chemical and neuroplastic effects in limbic brain regions which might favor stress coping strategies and resilience to depression development CBD allowed the effects of small doses of serrated genic antidepressants such as larec Satine to be effective so so sometimes they can see what you have small doses of the latter less decrease their side effects without compromising the antidepressant effect so this is saying that Co administering CBD along with antidepressants can actually help boost their effect which means CBD can be a wonderful tool to help people get off of antidepressants or to use less of the antidepressant so they're not experiencing major side effects from that pharmaceutical drug okay so if you're taking antidepressants CBD can help you lower that dosage or even get off of it if that is what your goal is CBD holds promise as a potential aid for depression CBD includes antidepressant effects is not the same as saying that marijuana isn't instead of presence so you can't say that in marijuana as a whole is an antidepressant but certain properties of CBD can have this antidepressant like effect okay so what are some other benefits that means surely there are so many other benefits right well there's another benefit here cancer this planet fights tumors better than chemotherapy oh my gosh really I thought chemotherapy was like the best I thought chemotherapy you know being sarcastic there I I know I know chemo therapies like your were the last resort you should do even though it's technically the first resort oncologists do and here's the thing about oncologist which we were I'll talk about it when we get a little bit through this article the compounds in marijuana that provide these benefits include terpenes flavonoids and the cannabinoids known as CBD and THC uh okay so both T is CF CBD and THC can help with cancer let me know more cannabis in camp so cannabis and cancer many people refer to the use of marijuana or CBD to help control the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy so if you think cannabis can help with cancer you may think you know you're nauseous from taking these chemotherapy drugs so you need this to help you with the no-show but no no it goes much further than that marijuana also possesses an indict independent ability to fight tumors specifically brain breasts thyroid : pituitary lung and prostate tumors as well as melanoma and leukemia so it can help you destroy those tumors and how can it do it marijuana can't wriggle trigger self suicide which means cancerous cells are killed leaving healthy ones behind so marijuana can actually kill the unhealthy cancer cells that are living in our body that are multiplying that shouldn't be there marijuana can help cut off the blood supply to tumors so they can really destroy tumors while leaving the healthy cells intact and here's the thing you can't say the same for chemotherapy because chemotherapy destroys it's like a nuclear bomb goes off in your in your in your body your um yeah a nuclear bomb going off in your body you're destroying your the cancer cells and you're destroying your healthy cells your healthy cells is what prevents you is what fights off the cancer and you're destroying that as well but chemotherapy does not destroy the cancer stem cells which means that they once you're done chemotherapy they can come back even stronger and they would be more immune to chemotherapy if chemotherapy is not designed to target the stem cells of hands and cancerous stem cells in your body so they can destroy it's like if this is the main cancer stem so and it's producing all these other smaller cells they can only destroy the smaller cells but until you get rid of the root it's going to your body it's going to continue to make cancer and that's what marijuana can certainly be able to help in some cases CBD and THC together seem to be more effective at treating tumors than either substance alone so usually if you have cancer generally you would use a very high dose of both CBD and THC together you can't just say I'm just going to just chug a bottle this CBD a day you know or I'm just going to get my medical marijuana and just take a bunch of THC oil or edibles or some vapor or smoke or whatever it's the together combined effect that can be the most beneficial for a cancer so now we talked about hip CBD so we're talking about the type of hemp that is derived okay that um you can purchase legally on online not extracted from the marijuana plant hemp CBD has been shown to be effective against various types of cancer Hemme CBD reduces the ability of a very varying cancer cells to spread which suggests it could be used to help prevent ovarian cancer metastatic metastasis and was found to slow ovarian cancer comparable to or even better than the current ovarian cancer drug cisplatin okay so again this is a wonderful remedy that is found in nature that can help prevent some of these issues that more and more of us are having and we're having more and more cancer because of the toxic world that we're living in so you can't always get rid of those toxic factors but you can have some preventive Xand I always say CBD should be a supplement that we should all be taking it is expensive that's one of the downside it's like no matter where you find that you're not going to find cheap CBD it is very very expensive okay CBD reduces cancer cell viability and many cancer types such as neuro blastoma oh my gosh glioblastoma melanoma leukemia colorectal breast lung and prostate cancer so CBD can actually help with all of that as well I believe that's it for this article okay yes let's see what the mayor the American Cancer Society has to say about that what did they have to say with marijuana and cancer so I did did a few things here and it's interesting what they're getting out here okay Exley quite fascinating okay hopefully that's large enough when taken by mouth such as in baked goods the THC is absorbed poorly and can take hours to be absorb so as we as we mentioned you're the number one way to get CBD and into your body especially good like if you're having a seizure or you know if someone who's better have a seizure or there's a documentary that I watched was actually the next article it's not an article but I have the links in the description the kid was having us seizures but you can't just you know eat something when you're about to have a seizure you need immediate something immediate and that's why a vaporizer or vape or smoking is the best thing I can't endorse smoking at all okay but I can endorse more vaping if that is what you need to get it into your body as quickly as possible or if about to have an anxiety attack and this is the only way that'll help you okay the vape that's the number one way to get into your body I know many people don't like that way which is fine in the next way is oils so as you can see here I take some oil here I put it onto my tongue and I just leave that there for like a minute it shows you and tell you they're like a minute yeah okay leaving it under the tongue is the second best way to get it into your body of mucous membrane and get it into your body there's usually if you eat it it's not absorbed as well it takes longer to get into your body but it also seems to last the longest in in the body so usually the method method that takes longer it's more of a slow progression whereas if you babe it you put on your tongue it's more like spike and then it goes down pretty quickly okay smoked or vaporize THC Andrus the bloodstream it goes to the brain quicker so again it depends on what your needs are that whatever way may be best for you to acquire the the CBD or the or the THC let's see what the American Cancer Society has to say about how can affect cancer smoke marijuana sand found to help treating nausea and vomiting just as we said in the previous one so are they going to add knowledge at all that it's going to help with tumors and a fight tumors it's a it helps with a neuropathic pain it helps improve food intake okay there are no studies in people of the effects of marijuana or your head portal so they haven't even done any studies to actually see if this is even beneficial at all as the first thing why wouldn't they be on top of these studies if many people are having healing benefits from it if many people are taking this what wonderful substance and they are going back to their oncologists and the cancer is gone why wouldn't they study it more uh here's the thing oncologists aren't trained when it comes to marijuana okay because here's the thing my grandfather had cancer and he had passed actually both my grandfather's had cancer and they both passed away because of you don't really die off the cancer it's what the cancer does to you which is it causes you to have a lack of appetite and you don't eat as much and your body is not able to be healthy and as a result you tend to lose a lot of weight you become a lot feeling a lot worse and you don't get the nutrients your body needs to fight off the cancer so the cancer just overwhelms you so she really due to lack of nutrients in your body okay and here's the thing with oncologist don't really know anything about marijuana one of Maya grandfather's was he was having it and it was that Andrea Tammy brought it up to her and says no no no no I'd rather I'd rather give give you chemotherapy drugs because that's been proven to fight cancer I'd rather not get get my patients high so this person was completely oblivious and just the UM unknowledgeable about the wonderful benefits that marijuana can have it's not all about getting high and that's all she was thinking about and instead she was saying you can drink milkshakes you can eat this and that milkshakes and eaten foods that are very high in sugar very high in fat even dairy products specifically all directly linked to cancer so she's saying consume more of products that are going to fuel with the cancer in your body and I'm gonna give you drugs to fight the cancer but you're still going to have cancer so I'm gonna try to fight it off so it makes no sense it makes a zero sense well it makes sense from from a profitable standpoint but it makes no sense from a healthy standpoint uh so marijuana extracts in clinical trials tended to need less payment and medication so people who who took marijuana don't need as much pain medication which is cooter because we have a major problem with opiates a lot of people on on opiates THC no no cannabinoid Center CBD slow growth and or cause death in certain types of cancer cells growing in lab dishes so they're acknowledging in here that it does have some effects and I'm annoyed may slow growth and reduce spread of some forms of cancer oh so they are acknowledging it relying on marijuana alone is a treatment while dividing or delaying conventional medical care for cancer may have serious health consequences hmm so saying don't just rely on that do the other things as well you know I saw up to you that's entirely your choice there are plenty of people who reject the conventional way and go the more natural way and are able to heal but that's not always the case and here is what we get to Kenna cannabinoid drugs yes so they realize doctors pharmaceutical industry realizes that this this plant is helping people in so many ways is helping people fight cancer how can we profit from this how can we use this plant and patent it in a way that we can make money from it as well that's right turn it into to prescription drugs so we have marinol and Kaz Ahmet we are okay this one is a synthetic drug with th say this one is is THC to help with nausea and vomiting and weight loss okay again prescription drugs why do you need prescription drugs when you can just have the plan itself it's for that it's for that money there's no there's no other reason why they would need to create prescription drugs from a natural substance unless they want to patent it and say this is mine this is what I created this is this is where the properties are fun because they can't patent some that grooves so they have to make a drug out of it to be able to patent it and that's the most disturbing point of all of this okay I think that was it for that very very serving now if you're interested in more of the effects of marijuana and hemp I certainly recommend this documentary here the sacred plant secrets exposed as well as they have a season to the sacred plant healing secrets examined yes this is I definitely recommend this as well I mean take a look listen here so I have watched all the episodes of this I don't think the episodes are all up anymore besides like the first episode but it tells you here episode after you hear their stories they've talked about why finding out about the sacred plant changed their lives in medicine they yeah they talk about how it helps people with cancer and I think that's like the main the main thing it talks about so certainly check them out as well and and there's and this is the one that I said people had

"GxvBQZF1rE4": "cbd oil and hemp oil have both experienced a rise in popularity over the past few years but they are different products that offer distinct benefits both compounds are derived from different varieties of cannabis plants cbd oil is extracted from leaves flowers and stems of the cannabis sativa plant while hemp oil is made from the leaves flowers and stems of the hemp plant both oils are associated with cannabis but what's the real difference between them cbd is short for cannabidiol which happens to be an active ingredient in cannabis plants while some cbd oils do have low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol thc it is not enough to experience the euphoric feeling associated with other thc infused products on the market cbd is sold over the counter as a remedy for pain relief

cannabidiol works with the body's own endocannabinoid system which is a complex cell signaling system experts don't completely understand how cbd interacts with this system but they seem to think that it helps to treat certain ailments as well as regulate sleep mood memory nausea and appetite hemp oil might contain low levels of cbd but not enough to have the same benefits as cbd oil however there are many brands of cbd hemp oil on the market it is worth noting that hemp oil and hemp seed oil are sometimes advertised as the same thing but they have differences hemp seed oil differs from hemp oil in that it is manufactured from the seeds of the hemp plant because of that process hemp seed oil does not contain much cbd or thc as a result hemp oil is used in beauty products for its moisturizing capabilities because it is loaded with healthy fats it is also used for cooking or taken as a supplement don't forget to subscribe our channel", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is

patients with medicine costs medical marijuana is a safe effective medicine that improves medical outcomes and the overall quality of life for people with serious conditions our goal is to help those with serious conditions afford medical marijuana today i'm discussing using medical marijuana to treat symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis also known as becturos disease medical marijuana will not cure this condition but can help significantly with pain and other symptoms so let's look at what ankylosing spondylitis is and how medical marijuana can help ankylosing spondylitis is a disease that causes inflammation in the spine small bones in the spine may fuse or come together this condition leads to severe chronic pain and occurs most commonly in men in addition to chronic debilitating pain ankylosing spondylitis can cause inflammation severe fatigue sleep problems depression and anxiety the condition usually presents in adolescence or early adult life people who have the hla b27 gene are more likely to develop ankylosing spondylitis but not all people with the gene will develop the condition ankylosing spondylitis can cause extreme pain in the lower back hips or neck and pain can be exasperated in the morning or during periods of rest or inactivity it most commonly affects vertebrae in the lower back hip and shoulder joints the joint between the spine and pelvis and other places where tendons and ligaments connect to bones mostly in the spine this reduces flexibility in the spine and causes deficits in posture breathing problems can develop if the ribs are involved it produces intense stiffness and chronic inflammatory pain ankylosing spondylitis can cause other health problems as well new bone forms to fuse sections of the spine as part of the body's response to healing this leads to a stiff rigid spine that can also stiffen the rib cage and make it difficult to breathe and function ankylosing spondylitis also leads to uveitis inflammation of the eye that causes sensitivity and blurred vision it also causes inflammation of the aorta which is the largest artery in the body and can change the shape of the aortic valve in the heart causing cardiac issues ankylosing spondylitis can also lead to compression fractures if bones thin weakened vertebrae drop putting more pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerves ankylosing spondylitis is currently managed through pharmaceutical interventions as there is no cure these include nsaids non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs opioid pain medications that have negative side effects and are often addictive or demards disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs corticosteroid injections may also be done into joints and tendons around the affected area in severe cases surgery may be recommended while there is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis medical marijuana can help with many symptoms that people experience with less harsh side effects than pharmaceutical interventions medical marijuana can also increase the potency of some prescription medications allowing patients to reduce or eliminate them completely chronic pain is the most common reason that medical marijuana is prescribed and used in the united states the pain relieving effects of medical marijuana are well established with dozens of clinical trials demonstrating that medical marijuana relieves pain effectively across many conditions cannabinoids in cannabis thc and cbd are strong anti-inflammatories which is also well established medical marijuana is able to relieve pain and other conditions that experience chronic severe inflammation such as arthritis rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia studies also show that patients are able to reduce or eliminate harsher pharmaceuticals with medical marijuana such as nsaids or opiate medications medical marijuana has synergy with opiate pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs that increase their potency to relieve pain and inflammation while decreasing negative side effects such as nausea and upset stomach or stomach pain constipation and other gastrointestinal issues since medical marijuana can increase their pain relieving and anti-inflammatory abilities while decreasing negative side effects at the same time it allows people to use less of these harsher medications or eliminate them completely medical marijuana is safe with an extremely low potential for addiction and has never led to overdose opiate pain medications are addictive require constant increased doses and have negative side effects medical marijuana is a safe alternative to these medications for many people in addition to treating chronic pain and inflammation medical marijuana can treat other symptoms people with ankylosing spondylitis experience if you experience uveitis or eye inflammation strong preclinical data shows that medical marijuana can relieve these symptoms as well people with ankyliosing spondylitis may also experience sleep problems fatigue depression or anxiety medical marijuana is proven through several studies to effectively relieve symptoms of both anxiety and depression when using the correct strain and dose the same goes for both fatigue and sleep problems medical marijuana is proven to improve sleep disorders relaxing calming indica strains induce sleep and allow for muscle relaxation and a good night's rest also demonstrated across many conditions energizing uplifting sativa strains can increase energy and focus and provide daytime relief of fatigue pain and inflammation allowing you to be more active and productive during the day medical marijuana is extremely versatile and safe with hundreds of different strains available that can provide both daytime and nighttime medical relief medical marijuana can also be used without intoxication which is desirable for medical marijuana patients to use medical marijuana effectively to relieve medical symptoms without intoxication medical marijuana patients should be knowledgeable about strain types thc and cbd ratios ways to use medical marijuana and the medical uses of all cannabinoids and terpenes in the cannabis plant you can find in-depth resources on all of these topics

writing up all over the country they call it the Green Rush marijuana has moved out of the back alleys and into the open have you cannabis crop y'all in some states it's legal to grow to sell to smoke and marijuana could be legalized in a city near you so easy to get and many think so harmless but when the smoke clears is marijuana bad for you or could pot actually be good for you marijuana is better than all those pills for you in terms of treating ya I travel the world for answers what does marijuana do to you what does it do to your kids a special investigation week our journey begins here in this small town home nestled in the mountains with the family who has never allowed TV cameras in before and you're gonna soon learn why this is so pretty out here yeah they live in Colorado one of two states where it's legal to smoke pot medically and recreationally but here it's also taboo to residents like Paige Figi and her husband Matt I'm sure it was mentioned to us by someone hey you should try this they're not no way he thought that's fringe no way down a million years no but in this area marijuana is far from fringe we're joins and do you want island sweet skunk medical dispensaries are everywhere hey well people are smoking in private clubs and public festivals but none of this is for Matt he's a military man and marijuana would be a career ender I grew up in Wisconsin in a well loving family and I was educated they're like oh that's a drug you don't do that and I never did but just decades ago marijuana was a legitimate medication also called cannabis prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacies this is Harry J that all changed in nineteen thirty you're relentless warfare against Henry Ames linger the United States first drugs are for him public enemy number one you guessed it marijuana this guy saw how he could increase the budget of his department by having this mission going at the marijuana you know saying that there's this drug that the Mexican migrant workers are smoking and it's loco weed and it's gonna make them crazy and they're gonna rape your women he got the anti-marijuana message out through news reports and then came this fan the film reefer madness portraying the users of marijuana as unproductive crazed people are still afraid of what pot can do to them in many ways to have defined our attitudes now for 70 years yeah marijuana then became illegal in 1937 and by 1970 it was a schedule 1 controlled substance the government was saying it had no medicinal value and had a high potential for abuse all reasons why the Figge stayed away from marijuana until this and this might be hard for some of you to watch okay baby this is their daughter Charlotte having a seizure we just thought it was just one random febrile seizure nothing to really do no medications it's a fluke right a fluke made sense after all Charlotte nickname Charlie was born perfectly healthy a fraternal twin to sister chase Charlie always had big big smiles just happy kids easy yeah easy very much so so it was around three months you said that when you first noticed that he had a seizure I was changing her diaper while putting a new diaper on from after the bath in her eyes just started flickering it led to the first of many trips to the ER they did the million-dollar workup MRI EEG spinal tap you know they did the whole workup and found nothing in sent us home no abnormal blood tests no abnormal scan and developing normally to you know talking and walking the same day as her twin nothing was behind yet by the time she was too though the seizures had become constant and started to take their toll on there once happy joyful little girl she started to really decline cognitively and she was slipping away and she just wasn't keeping up with her twin the figis finally found an answer it was awful news giove syndrome it is severe intractable epilepsy the seizure start during the first year of life and are unstoppable difficult to control and very damaging severe behavioral problems attention deficit hyperactivity the self injury you know banging her head on the floor and pulling your hair out and like a possessed child this isn't your perfect happy Charlotte it was a race against time many Dravet kids died young in early childhood Charlotte was almost three for the next two years the figis tried everything strange diets acupuncture and dozens of powerful drugs like valium ativan bina barbital but nothing seemed to help even worse some of the medications nearly killed her after window she stops breathing and after two doses her heart will stop did you have to do CPR then on her your CS I remember when her heart stomped and I had her pulse and I lost her pulse there was just nothing analyst is on its way she survived mommy's here but now it was fall of two thousand eleven and Charlotte was five years old when things were at their worst she just sees all night and a kid they're sleeping either in my room or next door they can hear her seizures dream all night 50 times a night and chase would come in in the morning and just misses her twin and just hug her and like rubber head and sams I'm just so glad you survived through the night last night Matt had been deployed to Afghanistan and the only thing he could do to help was start scouring the internet and he stumbled onto this video of a child using marijuana so how's everything go Jeannie had four days without a seizure I'm like wow this having success and specifically gervais this is interesting it's natural and while he couldn't ever imagine taking marijuana himself he was now in the stunning position of recommending it for Charlotte I was like we need to do this and I said I don't know charlie dang I and then Charlotte's condition got worse 300 seizures a week almost to every hour she was not talking or moving basically catatonic as a last resort doctors wanted to either prescribe a powerful veterinary drug used on epileptic dogs or put Charlotte and a medically induced coma so her brain and body could rest for Paige those were not good options but maybe just maybe marijuana now was but she was about to find out how hard that would be this isn't go to the pharmacy and pick up your medicine there was no protocol when we come back what will the figis do and what would you do if this were your daughter I had resigned myself I don't think she's gonna survive this we've seen her flatline in hospital we've said goodbye you're listening to Matt and Paige Figi described their own daughter what would you do if this were your child Charlotte Figi had an extreme form of epilepsy her body was so frail that any seizure could kill her with no traditional treatment left to try in the clock ticking away her parents decided to try marijuana Charlotte was just five years old need a card in order to be able to get the cannabis from a pharmacy doctors have prescribed it II need two doctors in Colorado to get the card for a juvenile or a child it was hard we were the first young child and they said no everyone said no no no no no certainly her age played a played a role in my hesitancy dr. Alan Shackleford is a harvard-trained physician he's also among a handful of doctors in Colorado who give prescriptions for medical marijuana from the moment Charlotte entered his office he knew she was in trouble while he was just examining her she had two seizures she'd failed everything uh there were no more options for her everything had been tried except cannabis here's how scientists think it might work marijuana is made up of two ingredients th see that's the psychoactive part that makes you high and CBD also called cannabidiol it's the CBD that scientists think modulates electrical and chemical activity to help quiet the excessive activity in the brain that causes seizures I've been telling my patients of dr. Julie Holland is the editor of the pot book a complete guide to cannabis for a long time the work on cannabis and epilepsy was sort of inconclusive maybe it works maybe it does and they couldn't quite figure it out it's only when they really started separating THC from CBD that they saw you know definitively yes CBD seems to really stop seizures so the figis needed to find something that was rare a strain of marijuana that was low in THC of course they didn't want Charlotte getting stoned but also high in CBD to treat her seizures and that wouldn't be easy dispensaries and growers they make their money off strains that are high in THC I'm Joel I'm Josh no one knows that better than the Stanley Brothers their family business is pot and if you look at these clean-cut guys and what you see surprises you don't worry they've heard it all before when we round the corner they're like oh wait a second you know did you finish high school they all not only finished high school but also college and in some cases graduate school now they are some of colorado's biggest growers and dispensary owners they produce up to 600 pounds of medical marijuana a year and much of that marijuana is high in THC but here on their remote farm at this undisclosed location in the mountains it takes a lot of plants where we're allowed to grow six per patient they have been growing something different something they call revolutionary it's a greenhouse one greenhouse wine yes welcome dude [ __ ] to paradise behind closed doors and under tight security we enter what the Stanley's call the Garden of Eden there's nothing like this in the world this plan is 21% CBD and less than 1% THC it took years of crossbreeding plants to get to this point instead of breeding up the THC we've bred down the THC and bred up the CBD when people said you're crazy you know who's gonna smoke that so why grow it then well the Stanley's also believed in CBDs potential to treat many diseases and they had seen it changed lives before but always have too strict I meet 19-year old Chazz more he uses many different strains of marijuana many of them high in CBD to treat his rare disorder of the diaphragms my abs like lock up that's why he's talking this way almost speaking in hiccups like he can't catch his breath it's called Maya clonise diaphragmatic flutter its fluttering here it's annoying and but it becomes painful yeah went pretty quickly I mean it yeah yeah after like 15-20 minutes this is what I can't let start to really feel he's about to show me how the marijuana works he's been convulsing now for seven minutes how quickly do you expect this to work what's it like the first five mins and I'm done like what's that that's it it was actually less than a minute depending on the attack in the day like it'll work within the first couple hits hear how his voice is completely different that attack lasted eight minutes but some have lasted much longer and happen as often as 40 times a day and like Charlotte he had tried so many things before by 16 Chaz was taking these powerful addictive potentially deadly narcotics and muscle relaxants daily like valium and morphine you'll be safe to say that that marijuana what you have in your hand there is better than all those pills for you in terms of treating well yeah I am yeah I wouldn't I'm not zombified I've had 16 17 attacks today and I'm still sitting up talking to you my first attack on all these I'd be in the hospital I'm a firm believer that marijuana has actually saved my son's life Jazz's father sean has a quality of life now is a thousand times better than what it was when he was on the pharmaceuticals a quality of life that Paige Figi desperately wanted for her daughter Charlotte but she still had one hurdle to cross convincing dispensary owners like the Stanley's to sell marijuana to a five year old little girl when Charlotte's mother called my brother Joel the brothers had a meeting to tell us about this patient she's five years old he said and we said no we can't do that why it was the fear of the unknown Charlotte was the youngest patient at the time wanting marijuana would it be too much for her or would it change her life forever we'll find that out later but first learn more about what marijuana does to your kid's brain and yours as well April twentieth Denver Colorado tens of thousands from around the country and the world lighting up legally happy cannabis cough y'all for some it's a lifestyle for others it's a lifeline foundation and brightest but for all of them I wondered what was it doing to their brains some of my patients call me pot doc your patients call you papa they never meet anybody who's interested in hearing about their marijuana use as i am dr. Stacy Gruber is serious about pot I want you to name the color and not to read it okay I met her in her labs in McLean Hospital near Boston she's using high-tech imaging to see what happens in the brain when you smoke when you first smoke that is you know you light up a joint the spliff a blunt receptors which are throughout the brain respond and these areas of the brain are responsible for things like pleasure memory learning sensation a sense of time and space coordination movement appetite and other drives shall we say so it's sort of an all-over impact right so reward pleasure hunger um you have this this overall feeling of well-being they say that all sounds pretty good but it does sound pretty good and it's not just feeling good but there's this phenomenon reported by many smokers over the years especially famous artists the ability to be more creative when you feel that high there's sort of a release of dopamine and your brain sort of has the ability now to perceive things slightly differently from the way you might have if you hadn't been smoking pot what you really see is this reduction in hibbett or e function uh welcome doctors were pretty spectacular less inhibition that's something that peiner a mirror says helps him be more creative a successful artist his canvases sell for up to 25 thousand dollars it's my favorite way to work Julia marijuana yeah he's been painting for 14 years smoking for even longer he says it makes him feel more relaxed but most importantly for him he says it makes him less critical of his own work stop worrying so much about this and that and just sort of looking and being as present as possible a mere does caution that it's a delicate balance for him it would make me very apprehensive as maybe a little paranoid just too analytical you can get paranoid you can have disorganized thinking you get disoriented it can be uncomfortably to panic attacks or anxiety attacks and people how do you know when you've done too much simple tasks become very frustrating like mixing paint and then just sort of get into this state of uh you know and now and why that happens is exactly what Columbia University neuroscientist Carl Hart is investigating exhale research subjects in his lab smoke marijuana and then take a variety of cognitive tests the effects will be disruption in memory disruptions in inhibitory control they will become slower at cognitive functioning a wide range of things these effects are temporary but they're pretty pronounced and they are clear and it's slowly becoming clear to scientists what part of the brain is most affected it's the prefrontal cortex it's very important for planning thinking coordinating your behaviors there are tons of marijuana receptors in this region and we think that marijuana particularly in the novice can disrupt all of those behaviors an impairment that heart cautions could be dangerous especially when driving you may prematurely hit your brakes you may prove and surely hit the gas pedal a wide range of things you may make a term without looking more carefully look at this experiment done by CNN affiliate que ir o in Washington state subject smoke marijuana and then drove one was a daily medical marijuana smoker and another an infrequent weekend smoker relaxed and buzzed the more the novice user smoked the more trouble behind the wheel watch yourself watch yourself but interestingly the habitual smoker didn't have as much trouble asura though yeah and that's something I witnessed firsthand driving around with 19 year old Chazz more the day that I spent with him he had been smoking all day long do you feel impaired at all no i don't i feel normal turns out when you test people who have a lot of experience with cannabis you don't see many disruptions but if you test people who have sort of a limited history with cannabis you can see some clear pronounced disruptions of course no one thinks that driving when using marijuana is a good idea but what scientists can't answer is if there is a safe legal limit and if people who use marijuana daily as a medicine should be able to drive how impaired are they what is more clear though is the effect of marijuana on the young brain what we see is a very big difference in people who begin to smoke prior to the age of 16 and those who smoke after age 16 what we call early versus later onset Gruber's brain scans show that the white matter those are the highways that help the brain communicate from one point to another are impaired and those who start smoking early maybe there's underlying white matter connectivity differences that that's your that's your concern it sounds like that those highways those white matter highways are just more disrupted in people who start smoking early that's that's what we see perhaps not surprising given what we know about the young developing brain that's a very delicate time in brain development and that's not a good time to be taking any drugs preliminary research shows that early onset smokers are slower at tasks have lower IQs later in life higher risk of strokes and increased incidence of psychotic disorders and while these studies are not conclusive some scientists are still concerned because in two thousand twelve thirty five percent of high school seniors lit up and that could mean a generation of kids with damaged brains and many fears something else I never really told myself I need to help a generation of marijuana addicts when we come back the truth and the science behind what's being called a growing epidemic and later Charlotte's story the first and youngest child to try marijuana in Colorado this was the day Chaz more almost died pumped full of drugs like morphine dilaudid valium to quiet a non-stop 48-hour attack I thought I was gonna overdose and yeah it was pretty bad at his bedside his father Sean watched his son go from being catatonic to what he calls high as a kite how are you even watching yeah I've watched friends of mine died from taking the same drugs that he took you see Sean was a drug addict and he had struggled for decades to get clean it was scary it was really important for him not to take these drugs if he could avoid them if he could avoid him I know how addicted they are I've seen it it scared the hell out of me but sean is not scared of marijuana and neither is Chaz this right here I don't get sick off of it I can't overdose and Chaz is right about that while there are fatal accidental prescription medicine overdoses every 19 minutes in this country there are virtually no reports of fado marijuana overdoses and it's perhaps one of the biggest reasons most people think pot is safe in fact a new study of children showed that by high school only one in five think marijuana is harmful that's the lowest number in more than two decades and it's something we heard over and over as we traveled around the country not really that harmful it has a lot of benefits not really too concerned about it I think it's safe if you're a safe person probiotics but the experts we spoke to said there is more to the story there are people who compulsively smoke who want to stop smoking but they can't stop smoking in fact nine percent of marijuana users will become dependent now that's not as high as other drugs like heroin twenty-three percent of users become addicted or seventeen percent with cocaine or fifteen percent with alcohol but it's still approximately one out of every 11 marijuana smokers there is no longer any scientific debate that marijuana is not just psychologically addictive but also physically addictive so give me an update how you doing dr. Christian Thurston runs one of Colorado's largest youth substance abuse treatment clinics the number of marijuana addicts he treats his triple in the last three years alone literally I cried about it marijuana is number one on their list of priorities they have dropped out of life back in the day I wouldn't feel like my day has really started if I didn't get high Joel barges started smoking when he was just 13 x 15 he was smoking more than a dozen times a day he stopped skateboarding he even dropped out of school I like getting high I need to get high because my brain is telling me adolescence starting about age 13 have a pretty mature brain reward center so they can experience rewards and pleasures the same way adults can but the problem with that is that their prefrontal cortex which helps people think ahead control their impulses that's not fully developed until age 24 that explains why adolescents are much more vulnerable there's something else that addiction experts believe is likely happening in the brain when you smoke pot the feel-good chemicals that make up marijuana called cannabinoids remember them they cause your brain to stop producing its own natural cannabinoids when you stop smoking you have no feel-good cannabinoids of your own until your body kick starts production you feel lousy so many people smoke again to feel better and today's marijuana could be more addictive it has more of the psychoactive ingredient THC than ever before brain researcher dr. Nora Volkow Tim you smoke a very potent marijuana the 9 THC content is going to go very fast into your brain at are relatively high concentrations and then that increases its rewarding effects and it's likelihood of transition into addiction so how much stronger is it you see the barbed wire obviously on the fences well I traveled to Mississippi where marijuana is illegal but here on the campus of one of the country's oldest universities Ole Miss a huge stash of marijuana is under lock and key this is our vault this is some pretty tight security even look at this door Mahmud L solely runs what's called the marijuana potency project what's the potency of this this is about eight percent for three decades now his team has analyzed we've confiscated from drug busts this is thirty-six percent TFC you can smell it it has a good automatic smell how much does this worry you thirty-six percent THC confiscated very very dangerous material for someone that there's not experienced in marijuana smoking take some of this and they're gonna go into the negative effects of the high amounts of THC the psychosis the irritation the irritability the paranoia and all of this and while not all the plants are this high there's no question he's seen a trend in 1972 the average potency was less than 1% THC now it's nearly thirteen percent there are people becoming more obsessed with high THC marijuana I think so they start out with a half a percent of one percent and they get a good high and then I said continue to use that it doesn't give him the same high anymore so they seek either smoking more or higher potency material it happened to Joe Vargas after a couple of years of smoking daily Joel eventually ended up in rehab where he faced mild withdrawal symptoms like irritability insomnia nausea it certainly isn't anything nearly as dangerous as abrupt discontinuation of alcohol you know for somebody like Joel going into rehab is really about learning new behaviors more than it is about sort of treating the physiological dependence or tolerance or withdrawal issues Joel's been clean now for six months but these kinds of risks they don't scare off Charlotte figis parents people ask us that a lot like you know how did you make that decision it wasn't a decision is it was the next viable option and some would say a radical option marijuana for a five-year-old but it was an option they hoped would change her life forever baby when we come back Matt and Paige Figi finally give their Charlotte marijuana the results are shocking it was January 2012 Afghanistan about 7,000 miles away from his family in Colorado Matt figgy received this video from his wife Paige it's horrible seeing these videos when I'm deployed it was his five-year-old daughter Charlotte seizing diagnosed with a severe form of epilepsy she was having 300 seizures a week each attack so severe it had the potential to kill her they had already tried dozens of high-powered drugs we needed to try something else and at that point in time marijuana was that natural course of action to try at home in Colorado Hage searched for marijuana high in CBD that's the ingredient some scientists think helps seizures and also low in THC remember she didn't want to get her daughter stoned she found a small amount at a Denver dispensary the owner was surprised that anyone would even want it they said it's funny cuz no one buys this you know that was the general consensus that nobody wanted it it didn't have any effect Paige made eight hundred dollars for a small bag and took it home had a friend that was starting a business on making medicine and I said can you help me extract the medicine from the this bag of marijuana I measured it with syringe and squirted it under her tongue he was exciting and very nerve-wracking holding Charlotte in her arms Paige waited an hour ticked by and then another and then another she didn't have seizure that day and then she didn't have a seizure that night did you sit down yeah look at your watch right I thought this is crazy and then she didn't have one the next day and then the next day and I thought that is she would have had 100 fine now and I just I know I just thought this is saying I remember how happy page was like it's really working I can't believe it yeah that was I was pretty amazing to hear it had worked but in just a couple of weeks the excitement was overshadowed by Panik page was running out of marijuana and the dispensary didn't have any more of that particular strain even if there was more the monthly price tag would have been astronomical two thousand dollars and not a penny of it covered by insurance but then page heard about the Stanley's the six brothers and their greenhouse of marijuana that is high in CBD I said oh my goodness he says I don't know what to do with it we're trying new things at that but no one suit wants it it's not sellable I said just do it don't judge that does we need that plan at first they didn't want to take the risk of giving marijuana to such a young child but then they met her tell me about the first time you met Matt Paige and Charlotte I'm gonna get you misty I yeah you get all of his crying when we started talking about that little girl the figis had hit the jackpot a steady supply of high CBD marijuana and they only had to pay what they could afford people have called us the Robin Hood's of marijuana they say that we sell pot so that we can take care of the kids and the truly less fortunate Charlotte was the first of those kids late spring 2012 she tried the Stanley special marijuana and again it worked I can't tell you what them what that means to us could you get you doesn't it a little bit if it doesn't get you something's wrong with you she lived her life in a catatonic state now her parents get to meet her for the first time what a revelation yeah the child who had had 300 seizures a week was now down to just one every seven days bitter Pat tiptoe when I first met Charlotte March of 2013 it was one year after that first dose of marijuana at two after almost two years on a feeding tube she was now eating on her own yellow she was talking even walking happy yeah because she said please but these stories they are not without their skeptics one of the countries to hospitals dedicated to Gervase syndrome in Florida State's at present there is no evidence that cannabidiol is effective for the treatment of epilepsy the American Academy of Pediatrics also opposes cannabis as does the National Institute on Drug Abuse it is such an amazing turn of events that it really can't be a fluke but I do still wonder you still wonder too Matt hell now I'm you know it's working it's working great you just look wonderful and Charlotte's dr. Alan Shackleford also agrees yet his commitment to medical marijuana has drawn criticism he's even been called dr. feelgood how difficult is this for you to talk about as a physician we are typically conservative as a profession and and probably as individuals we want more proof and cannabis doesn't have that and it's why he has traveled the world to look for researchers who might have the answers and that took him to the place many coal the medical marijuana research capital Israel it might surprise you but actually research into cannabis and epilepsy started here in the 1970s with studies that showed it could reduce convulsions in rats today Shackelford is hoping to start clinical trials in humans there we need to understand it well enough that they won't be reluctant to at least give it a thought at least try it and it's not just epilepsy but researchers in Israel are studying a variety of illnesses when we come back what they're finding up close and an amazing look inside hospitals and nursing homes where patients are lighting up courtesy of the Israeli government as the Sun was rising on the ancient city of Jerusalem the final leg of our journey was just beginning they've been some great advances here and I'm proud of that obviously dr. boas love is with Israel's Ministry of Health here they have pioneered marijuana research they were the first to isolate THC and CBD decades ago and now the country's ministry license 10,000 patients to use marijuana medicinally and has approved more than a dozen studies to treat illnesses like PTSD pain crohn's disease even cancer hopefully this will prove to be the best vacation I really hope so we're not there yet answers might come from places like this it's a state-run nursing home outside of Tel Aviv residents here are using marijuana for pain loss of appetite Parkinson's disease and dementia mache root is one of those residents he was 77 when he smoked his first pipe of marijuana he's 80 now and he smokes a couple of times a day it's to help with the pain and the hand tremors caused by a stroke so it's a mixture of tobacco and marijuana he even decided to light up during our interview to stop his hands from shaking you're saying your hands are steady because of the marijuana zibbet whew it also helped ease a deeper pain hidden from sight you seem O'Shea is a Holocaust survivor when his wife died a couple years ago he was haunted by nightmares of a childhood hiding from the Nazis the marijuana he says took him out of the darkness you dream you died when you when you smoke yeah there are 19 other patients here scientists at Tel Aviv University are now studying their progress and they call the results outstanding including weight gain improve mood pain and tremor reduction but I can tell you as a doctor it was my next stop that proved the most surprising this is Israel's largest hospital Sheba Medical Center he put up your medical cannabis Amash a is using marijuana to help him with the pain and nausea from chemotherapy throwing up the spoon so that's your medicine inside there well not take it out what up the road and he's doing it inside the hospital how are you feeling I really first of all into my folding leg and you're not worried about any any potential damage to your body not at all the opposite actually I I really I really believe I can be cancer-free for a long time you [ __ ] it continue the no consume cannabis yes he said cancer-free very early studies on mice in Israel Spain in the united states are now showing the potential of marijuana to kill cancer cells it's exciting research but it is still in its infancy and it's inconclusive this program at cheba is well established an experts say a teaching tool for using marijuana in other hospitals do you think this could happen in the United States I don't know that there's yet enough really concrete evidence of cannabis as benefit that satisfactory at least in that context I think it's gonna come but it could be slow going the FDA has been great at approving studies but Nationals to drug abuse has been really stonewalling and blocking any studies looking at therapeutic effects of cannabis because that's not their mandate their mandate is to look at the harms of drug use it's very easy to blame an organization dr. Nora Volkow who is the director of NIDA says they are not standing in the way she claims they are not the only government Institute that approves marijuana research if you would come up with a grin that says okay this is going to be a treatment for drug addiction they would go to us but if it's cancer it comes to the Cancer Institute if it is schizophrenia it comes to niamh and so the Institute's have a mission with certain diseases what is clear there are bureaucratic hoops that most researchers simply don't want to jump through neuro scientist Carl Hart there not many people studying marijuana it's very difficult to get approval to study marijuana what's nice about Israel is that the government is helping the research to happen and it's research that could give hope to patients like Charlotte Figi I may be scientists in Israel are learning that marijuana use might actually protect the brain not damage it they've been able to show that it can decrease the amount of brain damage from head injuries right in mice to be able to give a medicine after the injury to reverse some of the damage that's huge I'm gonna paint your nails I'll paint your nails I literally see Charlotte's brain making connections that haven't been made in years it's almost seeming to build her brain where before it seemed it broken and while scientists are still at the very early stages of knowing if this is actually happening I can tell you it was remarkable to see her progress in the three months since we first met her we saw a change she was now talking more she's horseback riding good girl she even rides a bike on a road and the special strain made for Charlotte is now named for her it's Charlotte's Web it is Charlotte's plan it's char let's plan not anymore now it's for all the children more than 41 children are using Charlotte's Web here in Colorado all of them are reporting significant seizure reduction and there are dozens more on a waitlist hoping praying that a plant could change their lives just like it did for Charlotte let me get to you both seem very apiece I'm very at peace yeah very peaceful we've been given a great life you know it's so unfortunately Charlie has this dravet syndrome but thank god we've got something now that's working she's doing so great today", "HBOaSjKZ8gA": "[Music] hello friends welcome weights the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and sorry for the view change here we're doing some rearranging here in weeks HQ and things should look back to normal again pretty soon so what are we talking about today guys we are talking about another edible and we are talking about our third product from the folks at Chiba choose this time we have picked up their strongest product they make to see if it's gonna do us the business or not so this is Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams it's about as good as you can get for Chiba choo and I'm kind of excited I never really I've tried to cheap and choose in the past both hundred milligrams found them a little wanting they were okay both of them they just weren't as good as other hundred milligrams and there they were kind of expensive for what they were however this 175 milligram cost me 20 bucks which is a little expensive but not too much more expensive than say a hundred eighty milligram chocalate bar or whatever but this is obviously less substantial than that from what I understand she Batu's is one of the more popular edibles I think they exist not only here in California but they're also in Colorado Washington there are hugely popular brand and they've been around for a very long time so they probably have a lot of brand recognition which is why they're probably so popular so as I said this is the 175 milligram version I like the back here it's got all the stuff you want to see it's actually got the lab testing batch it's got the nutrition information the ingredients all that fun stuff always happy to see it on any packaging that's available out there alright guys so let's go ahead and tear this open and see how this tastes if I remember correctly last Chiba 2 I had was a hundred milligram ER and it was not very good tasting so I'm a little afraid that this one might also be a bit delicious if I could even open it well guys that's something to keep an eye out for it is this packaging is it does have little tear slits but done they don't really work and that'll do it will just rip it to pieces okay so we have gotten our 175 milligrams chocolate taffy out and that is crazy to believe that's a hundred and seventy five milligrams of THC right there it smells terrible it smells like chocolate and bitterness oh here we go this is the hundred and seventy-five milligram Chiba choose deca dose extra-strength chocolate taffy Oh Oh God oh my god Oh oh good I wish I had some water on me Oh whoo well after Jason oh holy [ __ ] wow that is up there with the kirova salted-caramel blondie or the enjoy goldfish in terms of the worst-tasting animals I'm a rat that was disgusting I knew it was repulsive oh it was a tiny little package and it does have me optimistic though that that a tiny little package producing that much of it tongue twisting tongue turning vile taste result might actually be as potent as advertised so on taste you don't get much worse than Sheba choose extra-strength deca dose but we'll see about the potency and for that guys I'm gonna come back to you in two hours as I do with all our reviews or for you just wait a couple of seconds and we'll catch you right after the break thanks for sticking around see you soon the BAM we're back guys it's been two hours since I had Chiba choose deca dose extra strength 175 milligrams and it's definitely more potent than a normal Chiba chew but it's not quite as good as say a kiva bar or the Jose or a 4:20 bar I did not find it to be as good as that I am pleasantly hi ants in like a 6 but not where I hoped to do it been especially for how bad it tasted oh my god it is awful tasting guys it is who it is Dukey licious [Music] but it is a very small little thing and I always say I love small potent edibles and it's small and reasonably potent so that's a win in its category however I think this one costs roughly double what a normal Chiba chew costs and I'm not sure it's I feel twice as high as and almost you at you maybe it's hard to say I don't think it charts linearly you know I find what I'm saying highs higher high as in a linear relationship it's uh it's exponential maybe I don't know actually I don't know what the what the shape of the curve of a high is boy um this is not chiba choose that's making me talk like this this is exhaustion i have been up for i was looking at my watch which i dont even fun yeah I've been up for 25 hours right now so that's part of the reason I'm acting a little crazy but I am looking forward to this Chiba choose ability to hopefully let me get some a salamba because that is where I am headed to next to fairyland dreamland yeah if not fairyland dreamland boy oh boy if I had it and if I ever edited these that would this would be quite a job but I'm not going to so I'm sorry you guys alright guys but before I go and maybe cuz I'm just feeling tired and making you know being tired makes you feel a little pessimistic I want to share with you guys my cherry on top which is a terrible way of pitching that idea let me tell you something's gonna you feel awful no I want to share with you something might my cherry on top which is sort of how I should have started saying this something that I love to watch or do or read or see or whatever the case may be that is unrelated to weed that I want to share with you guys just a little something extra that I can tack on these reviews that hopefully you guys will enjoy and this review I want to share with you and this is why I said it's gonna be a downer this is why I said being tired might have influenced this but I saw in the bookshelf and I it's it's phenomenal it's it's another it's another game changer it's another one that will shift your thinking and thinking and that is the sixth extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert not Colbert but Cole Burke I think it is a book about mass extinctions and how there have been five mass extinctions throughout life's history on earth five times where what life was nearly wiped out and evidence suggests we are currently in the sixth one of those it's really good and and really well-written and and just a gripping read and it's short to like 250 pages so get on it guys I normally I'm not that forceful and I'm not that forceful about this one but if you if it sounds interesting oh my god I've been going on for four minutes and 15 seconds sorry but that does sound interesting yeah give it a shot I think you guys think you're gonna enjoy it it is pessimistic however I don't know if there's I can't remember if there's any optimism if there's any light in that book what am I talking about oh I am looking forward to some sleep hopefully provided brought to you by wherever the G Batu's wrapper is all right guys I am so sorry it took so long to spit all that [ __ ] out to anybody who's out there still listening thank you so much you're really kind for making the end of this one I not even I want to make it to the end of this one and I'm

DMT are they related they help each other hey guys G here just making a quick video on cannabis breath work at DMT are they related do they help each other something like called canna Wasco so bring some articles about DMT production the body we know it is produced in the lungs Thrasher both some other areas a recent article just came out saying that they did find very good evidence or very strong evidence that it is also produced in the pineal gland I'll share that link below but the interesting idea is like how does cannabis play a role in DMT production as it and does it work together in any way and some of the theory is that cannabis increases melatonin production 3,000 to 4,000 percent and melatonin is a neural transmitter it's very close molecular structure to DMT they say it's a few carbon molecule away or co2 mt- co2 or no melt or - CO 2 equals DMT and it's not exactly the structurally makes sense from a chemical perspective it's very close anyways and there's a lot of things that happen is that THC is also MAO inhibitor now I know if you're smoking it it's a bit different than if you're actually having an edible where I think that might come into play and what this to your lungs your lungs maybe the empty suppose all these things are going on but basically what the what the proposition or what the idea is that when you combine it with the breath work you can have some pretty incredible experiences with cannabis almost like full-on ayahuasca type experiences so so we're gonna be trying today I mean I'm I'm gonna smoke a lot of ground here of cannabis which is legal here in Canada there's there we go it's gonna roll this up smoke it and about 30 minutes of deep breathing looks like wim HOF style without the breath Holtz because the speculation or the offices want to reduce the co2 levels because if we're pulling the co2 molecules from the melatonin or something that's that's what I'm going for you it will create DMT or DMT so you never practice and gonna play around with it but don't do this at home breath work should always be done a safe environment you should ever combine it with anything else so don't do what I'm doing so I'm not advising this at home spent one experiment I'm gonna share with you guys what happens after so here we go I'm gonna go and light this up here we are in the garage [Music] as I'm smoking this of saying an intention sending attention to learn something new tonight to explore myself with the help of plants and to let go and trust into the experience as well as my intentions and to share so I'm just gonna lay in this coach here I'm just gonna turn the lights off I'll put some headphones on since some music [Music] crazy it's crazy say so much more so much positivity some amazing people and opportunities of my life they're still seeking seeking for deeper purpose deeper meaning it's like I'm so close I'm there feeling it it's energy it's amazing powerful energies running through the universe it's running through me are you singing saying same thing that thought would be long sing with all your heart saying like you mean it sing like you're seeing somebody sing like you're singing to yourself to your ancestors so all those who walk the earth before you sing to your children for the ones you have to come sing just to sing for no reason whatsoever live feel play create oh you can have it all it's nothing it's so simple you don't need much you don't need anything at all you just need love oh it's so basic so pure so unconditional so infinite sustainable love is so sustainable it's the ultimate sustainability it is oh my god the answer to everything we got this we need to love more me to teach people how to love have to love one another it was quite an interesting experience it's hard to say whether like I didn't have many visuals a lot of introspection which which can be associated the level DMT releases you know before it gets super visual you know some of the Rick Strassman studies I think they had some effects of that or even like micro dosing but for me it was hard to tell was it the breathing because I know he can get there with breathing was it the cannabis was it a mix of the two I'm not sure when I got to a point where it was very euphoric this is my own experience I wouldn't suggest it at home but I'm gonna continue to play with it to see there's ways to improve on it if I can go deeper with it as well and I think one of the important things that I realize is that um it's hard to do on your own to stick with it sighs I was breathing for maybe 40 minutes my mouth got really dry because obviously you smoked cannabis you feel parched so I'm gonna say next I might have a little spray ball to just spray in my mouth when it gets dry but I realized it was hard to stick with it so what I felt was 40 45 minutes where I was aiming for was only like you know 20 minutes or so I checked how long I've been recording I had only been like 20 minutes so I started again so I think that's one thing I would change is to either pre record myself guiding myself through it or having someone bring me through the experience so it was amazing experience it was challenging it was I had to push myself but a lot of insights came and you know it's something I'd like to explore more to really see what is there you know so breath work combines of the breath plus experience but I'm using it more as as a tool as like a ritual for introspection rather than just smoking all the time to sort of escape which I see a lot of people doing or just using for recreational to help you you know reduce stress or you know some people think it'll help you sleep better I don't think cannabis will make you sleep better I think it'll up sedate you but you won't get the depth of sleep which is really important to to understand but anyways this how I like to use it it's you know don't smoke very often when you do really go deep with it and I found that as I was starting to once I finish smoking you know again it's that natural you know a little bit of paranoia a little bit of negative thought patterns which which happens in camp with me and cannabis sometimes but I think it's it's a teacher like all plant medicine is trying to bring something to my awareness these are things that are my subconscious that I worry about and I just try to suppress them so some some things came up and instead of suppressing them you know I know in the ceremony was especially with ayahuasca stuff like that you know I always try to go right at whatever the fear is so if the fear comes up instead of trying to say oh I want to go there let me try to escape you know start fidgeting start you know suppressing or holding back it's like let's go right into it so I start breathing and just trying to focus with my full attention awareness on whatever that negative thought was and really trying to dive in is this true is this really something I should be worried about you know let me see what's there and as I breathe more into it it just dissolved and it was really nothing so I thought that was interesting and then after breathing and just losing myself into that um sort of rhythm of the breath things really opened up and totally let go cannabis and breath can be used together I think but it's gonna take some experimentation on myself to really come up with something that I'd feel comfortable sharing but I'm sure many of you already experimented on your own and if you are you know just please please be safe about it and don't do anything that I would do have a great day guys thank you for this video thank you for all the likes subscribing and sharing I really appreciate all of your support this is G signing off peace", "0i-U7zXdk8w": "there's a wealth of laboratory evidence that these anti-tumor properties kill cancer cells in a variety of ways there are multiple mechanisms of action identified by which cannabis kills cancer cells and they're divided into various categories and among these are antiproliferative effects normally that's that's one of the hallmarks of a cancer cell is that it just keeps reproducing so if you stop the reproduction that's an antiproliferative effect there are anti-angiogenesis effects and this means that the cannabinoids will stop the tumor from being able to elaborate or grow new blood vessels to support the growth of the tumor there are anti metastatic effects and that is simple enough to mean that the cannabinoids block the ability of the cancer cells to spread into other tissues and there's another effect that has a wild name a pop topic effect I apoptosis refers to the ability of cannabinoids to speed the death of the abnormal cells that's something that is is especially important in cancer because you're you're able to hasten the death of this cell without disturbing the normal cells around it Seth research laboratories in California have recently demonstrated that in some tumors cancer cells are killed by marijuana while the other healthy cells are left untouched cells that stop moving and become still white dots are dead cancer cells the ability of cannabinoids to kill bad cells while protecting healthy ones is particularly important when we're talking about brain cancer because of the so-called blood-brain barrier the brain has to be sheltered from outside influences that might hitch a ride on the bloodstream and cause havoc what is exciting and unique about cannabinoids is that they can pass through the blood-brain barrier because of their slippery fat loving nature cannabinoids get right into the brains cancer cells by moving easily through the cells membranes which are also composed of lipids the evidence is piling up in mice infested labs at the endocannabinoid system when stimulated by cannabinoids as an anti-tumor effect and can instruct cancer cells to commit suicide this was done by manual Guzman's group within the past in less than 10 years and what they showed there was that originally that THC when injected into a brain tumor in mice and rats a significant number of those animals with the tumor would regress and disappear so that you actually had survival of rats that that would otherwise die and they examined all the surrounding nerve tissue and that was all fine because remember once again

use the words marijuana or cannabis so this talk has nothing to do with that I'm here to sell you some cars so thank you for coming and we'll talk about the Kia Sorento No so let's talk a little bit about about the role of cannabinoids so the title it was marijuana and we're trying to move away from the use of marijuana which was actually coined by the American government many years ago when doing their sort of initiation of this Prohibition period this extensive period of prohibition that we've had and so really the active ingredients in cannabis are cannabinoids so we're going to talk a little bit about cannabinoids and I'm gonna trying to explain to you the the role of this plant in in medicine as a medicine it is a medicinal tool and I'll touch a little bit upon the recreational aspects of things as well as we go along because I think that comes to mind with with the new rules that are coming up and changing in the near future so let's see if I can it works so we'll start out by asking the question what is pain because that's what we're talking about we're talking about the role of cannabinoids in pain management so pain is a physical suffering or discomfort caused by illness or injury it can be physical in nature it can be mental and often it's a combination of the two and usually it initiates with you know some offending aspect either a broken bone a pinched nerve something like that that message is then transmitted up to the brain through the peripheral nervous system first through the spinal cord afterwards up to the brain it's processed in the brain that's kind of the mental aspect of things so it's processed up in the brain and then there are subsequent messages that go back down to the painful area to try and limit the amount of pain and to activate inflammatory responses and healing process and other things that take place so that's kind of the the basics of what how pain works and really we can kind of divide pain up a little bit more so that we're all kind of start at the same foundation of what we're talking about so pain can be divided up into an acute pain process which some comes on really quickly lasts for usually a relatively short period of time it can be chronic it can be lasting forever it can come on slowly often it's indolent might be sort of a two or three out of ten or it could be higher but it's chronic it lasts for long periods of time and then we have components of the breakthrough pain and breakthrough pain basically are where you might have a chronic level with exacerbation it's a periods of really acute drops in between the chronic and that's sort of breakthrough pain the pain can be as a cause of either a muscle or a bone or something more Hardware origin from joints and muscles or it can be more visceral the GI tract for example attend and and visceral pain tends to be more squeezing and uncomfortable in that fashion and then it can be neuropathic as well and that's kind of what we're gonna talk a little bit more about today which is the neuropathic pain then your Pathak pain really is a result of usually excuse me some form of damage or pressure to nerves often will have some sharp or shooting type pain burning type discomfort it's often associated with inflammation and that's important to keep in mind the inflammation often makes the pain worse in this scenario alright it often tends to be chronic it and then it has subsequent sequelae of the pain being present such as fatigue or weakness and it tends to be one that's more it's harder to treat you know the the advils and the tylenols of the world don't tend to cut it for this kind of pain often what is the effect of pain so I don't think I've to tell everybody anyone this because I think you all have at one point another had some level of pain or discomfort you understand that it can be it can be quite frustrating it can cause anxiety and anger fear depression it can lead to poor concentration and memory that can have sleep deprivation and fatigue so pain is not just the just a symptom of pain but it has a huge rundown effect a sequela again from that so what are the painful episodes in myeloma it's often as so first of all pain is the most common symptom in myeloma affecting up to 80% of patients at some point in another the sensation which causes discomfort or distress and it's often a signal that the body is dealing with an injury or illness the brain gathers this information as I showed you the pictorial the earlier on it gathers this information it processes it and then it sends out signals and usually traditionally we think pain was caused because of a means of the body trying to protect itself right so it's a warning system to the body to not you know exert anymore I said you know pressure or downside to that area that's that's hurting so it's meant to be a protecting mechanism in there the common symptoms and complications of myeloma pain have a significant impact of course on the quality of life as we have discussed briefly and so controlling this pain controls can have a lot of impact on a lot of other aspects of your life including the sleep the anger the depression etc that goes with it all right so the pain that we get most often in myeloma is often associated with bony related pain it can be due to thinning out of the bone or osteopenia and it can be resulting from lytic lesions that are caused that may cause dull achy pain on an ongoing basis this is of course prominent in my little bit off and also president many other cancers I deal a lot with prostate cancer in my business and I see a lot of prostate cancer metastatic disease to the bone and bony related pain as a result of that so and it can be quite and very debilitating for for our patients you can end up with bony fractures and can these can be compression fractures in the spinal cord for example or they can be outright fractures of long bones femurs and and the arms and things like that so when you get to bony destruction you end up getting various different to quality of that itself so you can get high levels of calcium spilling into the blood and the calcium itself can go through and start to cause grief in the gastrointestinal tract so you can get abdominal pain vomiting nausea etc as a result of the hypercalcemia that takes place you can get peripheral neuropathies because of some of the drugs that we use to treat the cancers and then there are of course paraneoplastic syndromes or or there's proteins that are released from myeloma and in other conditions as well other cancers as well that can get deposited on nerves and irritate the nerves themselves and that's a kind of a neuropathic pain that that involves from that so traditionally when we treat pain inside say myeloma you might be treating the primary cause which is the cancer itself and then you might be also using painkillers and there are various different pain medications that we as physicians have in our material to utilize for for patients and these include things such as an anti-inflammatories that can involve things like Tylenol they can be things such as antidepressants such as a me trip to lean and and there could be neuro blue called neuro modulating agents such as gabapentin and carbamazepine and sometimes you use steroids to try and help with the pain as well and of course opioids are often used as well tylenol 3 with codeine or fentanyl which sort of has a nasty kind of tone to it in the recent because of what's been happening out there so these are great if they work but they don't often work and the problem also is that we can get Anne Shiell side-effects from treating with traditional pain medications so narcotics for example can result in constipation and I've seen patients who have had such severe constipation and abdominal pain that it can be very debilitating there housebound and they have a real difficult time managing it simply because of the constipation of course there is the the narcotics have effect on your on your central nervous system and they can make you you know dopey and difficult to drive and it's tired and sleepy so there are a lot of side effects some of the medications we use and and narcotics aren't the only ones right so the neuromodulators can do similar things and and even they try cyclic antidepressants can do the same sort of thing so they all have side effects that we have to monitor for as well and if you can find a balance between the positive effect of the medication versus the the downside the negative effect or the side effect then of course you have you have a winner right you have a pain medication that's working for you without a lot of side effects but often as I said that is not the case and then and you have to escalate it to try different drugs and different treatments and we also try various non drug treatments which are fantastic the exercise diet heat etc having having gone through that you do need to escalate things sometimes and the Canadian Pain Society has a treatment algorithm which in the last iteration has included cannabinoids so this is kind of a real breakthrough a real move forward I think in terms of our society and how we think about the use of cannabis in the treatment algorithms for pain so as you can see in this publication recently you start out with all the traditional ones and absolutely as a physician that's exactly what I want to do I want to try my patients on the traditional treatment first see if it works along with all the ancillary treatments is that we talked about with diet exercise etc you then escalate it if that doesn't work you might go to something that's a little more have more side effects possibly more risk but may have a benefit as well such as tramadol and opioids and when that fails this is when we start to think about cannabinoids and I'm going to discuss with you in a minute here what the rule what the evidence do to support that is and then of course there are a bunch of other fourth line medications that can also occur they can also be used sorry I'm just gonna keep an eye on my time here it can also be used for treatment when cannabinoids and other traditional medications still work as well and these are listed over here as well so plant therapy for pain management has a long-standing history you know them because you've used them alright so for example the willow bark gives us aspirin I would hazard to say that just about 99% of you have taken aspirin at some point in your life and that resulted in us learning about how that works in our body so when aspirin when willow bark derived aspirin and aspirin we went and asked what how does it work in the human body we discovered the assistant called the prostaglandins same thing with opium so the over the the poppy seed the opium poppy seed gave us morphine morphine is a drug again that you know in the narcotic family and we've got a bunch of synthetics that have come along since then but that was that's a pain medication that you are all familiar with or at least are aware of and that in fact resulted in us learning about the endorphins in our limb body and their can and the in kefflin system as well so we learned about that as well well cannabis is no different so cannabis itself you know which comes from the cannabis plant we have now started to identify the active ingredients I should say now it's known for many years but we're starting to learn more about them now but they're what the active ingredients are in this plant just like aspirin just like morphine alright so THC and CBD are two active components that are inside the cannabis plant that that we utilize for pain management we utilize it for a lot of other things too but we're going to talk about pain this has resulted in us actually learning about how that works and that's through the endocannabinoid system so the endocannabinoid system is extremely well studied really well known and teased apart down to the molecular and cellular level we have a really good understanding of this system and how it works we're now discovering how we can manipulate this system so that we can get better pain management and other benefits the cannabis has alright so as I said plants have a long-standing history and pain management goes back over three thousand years you know Egyptians have there's there's evidence where they were Gyptian relics dating back to the 16th century BC appear to have ascribed medicinal benefits to cannabis so when you look at it internationally there is some strong evidence of long-standing use of this plant and I won't go into why we have really kind of created this taboo around cannabis but it really there is a specific lineage of how this came about through through the American government we can discuss that one-to-one at some point it's a it's an interesting story so does cannabis have does does cannabis have any evidence for success in use and the answer is yes it does alright so I'm gonna give you the pro in the con so there is multiple randomized control trials which are in medicine we consider you know sort of the PSLV the source of treat of studies that are done and their multiples trials done in various different disease entities such as HIV or multiple sclerosis or chronic neuropathic pain and these randomized clinical trials have on the hall shown a benefit for the use of cannabis and these are just some of them listed up here there are there are there are many of my colleagues that would say well there's no evidence to support the use of cannabis and they will quote a number of articles showing that there's no benefits so I'm gonna try and explain to you why there exists some controversy in medicine and how we're getting about that controversy now but there is evidence and there is evidence to support the use of this of this plan what's interesting though is when it comes to plant therapy unlike traditional pharmacological therapies which have a single agent that we can often derive from a plant figure out what it is and then chemically synthesize it we often forget that in plants there are multiple active ingredients and so I'm gonna encourage you to start thinking a little bit open your mind up and think a little bit wider here then a single entity a single molecule and think about plant therapy the entire plant and I'll explain to you why I think that's an important component but for one thing for example the chemistry and composition of cannabis is such that there are over 70 different phytochemicals either plant derived cannabinoids that we know have similar cannabinoids that have similar sort of makeup - endocannabinoids that are in our own systems so they mimic chemicals that are already in our body so these are plant derived chemicals that mimic what we have in our body okay and there's actually almost 500 distinct different compounds in these plants and we're only starting to now understand and learn about them more and more but again the key ones that we understand really well are CBD and THC alright those are the two active ingredients that we understand better the thing to keep in mind is that some of the controversy that comes around the use of the whole plant is that the plant will change what it's growing how much THC it has the kind of CBD it has based on the climate it's grown in and the soil is growing grown in how long it's growing for etc so there are some properties which are that haven't been sort of standardized by nature and give us different and therefore they give us a different outcome in the plant and it's not a dramatic difference but it might be a slight difference enough to make one person taking it for one study respond really well and another person taking it for the same study but taking a slightly different plant derivative not respond as well so those slight differences can occur and they might be just the different type of plant types so we're understanding that now better in medicine and in science and so what we're doing is we're standardizing how we grow the plants and we're we're breaking down the plants chemically so we understand what's in them and that's what we're using for studies now so that we're actually making it more uniform making our product more uniform so that we can see what the true outcomes are in a more uniform manner when we when we enter into scientific experiments so so here's the real cool part about this whole plant right so I talked to you about THC I talked to you about CBD but there's a whole host of other components that we have now found that are very active in various aspects of disease so these are for example terpenes terpenes are what give cannabis the smell so THC and CBD don't have any odor you that's not what you smell so when you smell weed when you smell cannabis right what you're smelling is the terpenes and these terpenes by the way exist in a lot of other flowers okay so when you go in okay I'm I don't cook but if you go and haze various different herbs I don't cook well but if you go use the various various different herbs they all have different smells those smells actually the terpenes that you're either you're actually smelling so the terpenes exist in a lot of food groups that we consume daily now all right and they also exist in the cannabis plant it's also what gives the cannabis plant the smell all right some of these have actually been teased out and have been shown to have effects on on various different disease entities so for example there are anti-inflammatory actions there are anti malarial actions there are antibacterial act actions there analgesics or pain control actions there anxiety makes you calm Z down there they are various different they're sedatives etc etc so there's various different attributes that some of the these terpenes have and these exist in the whole plant so this is why I'm encouraging you to start thinking about hope therapy because imagine now you have THC and CBD which actually have very strong activity for pain control which I'll show you in a minute but you also have all these additional components in the whole plan but give you these other activities that help you with the pain and management or for that matter of fact it might be to help you with the sleep because you're having too much pain anxiety etc right so there are other components that help out in the whole plant in order to activate a lot of these components we need to heat the plant top and we need to heat it to a certain temperature to get the active ingredient out because the way they exist in the plant is as a is a carboxylated acid so not the way you think of hydrochloric acid but it's just a stable stable form at sitting in the plant and when you heat that it releases that the active component so this is why for example you know for generations people of for example smoked cannabis as opposed to you know just consuming so this is where juicing for example has some controversy around it because in juicing you don't actually heat it up you're actually using the unactivated format but there are some benefits that have been shown there as well anyway the reason I bring this up is is because I will talk to you a little bit about smoking and vaping and stuff just so you kind of have a sense of where where this medicine is going let me just switch gears for a second here and talk a little bit about the endocannabinoid system so that you can have an understanding of why it works so the endocannabinoid system as i said is really well studied we understand it well there are receptors there are at least two receptors that we're we have studied well called CB cb1 and cb2 receptors they're found throughout the body but the but the highest density is of cb1 receptors is found in the brain and in various parts of the brain but the most important thing I think to take away is that what's really interesting is that there are almost zero CB receptors and almost zero endocannabinoid receptors in the brainstem the brainstem is the part that controls our heart rates it's the part that controls our breathing so when you hear about a fentanyl death in the media the reason that fentanyl kills or carb fentanyl or other morphine or other things the reason that they kill is because the in kefflin system the the these so fentanyl etc have receptors in the brain stem so there are lots of receptors in the brain stem so when fentanyl hits the blood and then gets into the brain it goes to the brain stem it causes respiratory depression and the person then dies usually of a cardiac arrest because there isn't enough oxygen to go to the heart to allow the heart to pump and they die they have a cardiac arrest this is what causes death from morphine fentanyl etc okay cannabis does not have receptors in the brain stem you'd probably have to consume 30 or 40 truckloads full of cannabis to try and load up the brain enough and you'd probably not be able to do that right and even then chances are that you would just throw up and maybe feel sleepy and go to sleep so there are actually no recorded deaths from the use of cannabis itself in terms of respiratory depression I should say you know specifically the way we have seen with the fentanyl crises so that's the first probably myth that I would like to dispel because I think one of the evils of this plant that has been that has been sold is the fact that it can cause that it's you know a drug similar to fentanyl etc but it's not it doesn't have that same sort of ill effect all right so it's something to think about we also as I said have a really clear understanding about how the systems work fairly good I shouldn't say it's perfect right there's lots and lots of studies going on but we have some good understanding about how it works and so if you recall that hope Hathway from when payne got to the brain and then back in the brain you now have receptors for cannabis for cannabinoids and these receptors actually the the way cannabis works the way THC and CBD work is by blocking the signals from one nerve to the next so when the message comes up to the brain then one nerve cell now communicates with the next nerve cell and tells it this is a painful episode happening do something about it what cannabis does is it blocks that signaling between the two it down regulates it down plays it so you don't have as much activity going on so the interpretation of that pain or pain itself starts to minute diminish right so this is how we feel this is one of the mechanisms of how cannabinoids work it works in the brain to slow down that that transmission of information so that you don't feel the pain so you get pain relief alright the other way that it works is in the peripheral system so we there are there are cb2 receptors remember I told you the cb1 and cb2 receptors there are cb2 receptors that are all over the body and the main area that they sit on is in our immune system where inflammation occurs so when you now take cannabinoids into the system one they go up to the brain and stop that that flow of bad information or information of pain and two it goes to the inflammatory system and it down regulates the inflammatory system and inflammation we know releases a bunch of chemicals that cause you to sense pain to feel pain and makes the pain worse especially neuropathic pain so by doing this in a two-fold manner what you've done is you've decreased the the central nervous systems interpretation of the pain you've also decreased inflammation in the peripheral nervous system so overall you're diminishing the amount of pain but also think about this there are significant other advantages here why because we know for example that some of the receptors in the brain work on anxiety areas so it's an angle it ik it makes it calms you down so it's nothing like being in pain gets you all wrapped up and anxious but but a cannabinoid can go in there and work on that system as well to create less anxiety what about sleep because when you're in pain you certainly aren't able to sleep partly because of the pain but probably because you're thinking about your pain and thinking about everything else too as a result of that well we know that cannabis or cannabinoids also work on some sedation and they work on similar pathways as known entities such as our sleeping medications that benzodiazepines right so see racks and a bunch of other sleeping pills that we that we as physicians prescribe our patients to help sleep it works on the same sort of a system so it helps with a sleep component too so all of a sudden you have a plant-based product that has multiple components that have multiple activities and this is why some of some of the the naysayers you might say in medicine and science say well this is like snake oil it works on everything how can it work on everything well the reason it isn't really working on everything but it's working on the root controller right it's kind of working on your CPU your main your main information in your computer so rather than working on a whole bunch of different lower-level instructional things it's working at the brain center of it all so it controls a bunch of other processes as a result of that so that's the way to start to think about the WYD has multiple effects in multiple different disease processes it's not because it's snake oil it's because it really works at a higher level before all the other disseminated pieces of information get down into the body okay like any medication like any plant it has side effects this is not a benign drug right we have to treat it with respect so even though I'm telling you it's a very safe plant derived medication and it is there are side effects and we must be cognizant of these just like any other medication you take from tylenol to advil to morphine to anything else right these are some of the side effects that we see commonly when we use it and these are primarily due to THC less so due to CBD CBD doesn't tend to have as many side effects but you can see things such as you know drowsiness and fatigue nausea and a whole host of side effects that occur luckily these side effects are not are generally not life-threatening these are not life-threatening side effects that you see but they do have side effects so anyone that says it's a completely clean drug and won't have any side effects they're lying right so you it does have side effects to be aware of the other argument that's used by a lot of my colleagues is well cannabis is a gateway drug no it'll get you addicted and and you'll start taking I don't know cocaine other things right so there are multiple levels of arguments that that that you can use against this but one of the interesting things is that there are some great amount number of research articles that are in published now showing what the dependency so we'll put gateway drug into sort of the dependency category but there's a bunch of other arguments you can make about it not being a gateway drug including a bunch of really good research out of the Mayo Clinic but the butBut the dependency part is really interesting because this is really interesting publication here as you can see you know in terms of dependency you can see where it fits in the schedule of things right so you have things such as codeine and and morphine etc the opioids which are higher than than cannabis alcohol significantly higher cocaine obviously and then even nicotine cigarette smoke very very addictive so if you really put it in the in the larger scheme of things you can see how the dependency of cannabis and especially when it's used in medicine and there is a big difference there especially when it's used in medicine is almost you know it's very low it's not non-existent but it's very low right and so when you look at the overall harms it certainly falls on the lower lower rung of that of that ladder of problem automatic drugs that we have in medicine let me just diverge for a second and talk a little bit about the about use of recreational versus medicinal so I'm gonna get through a couple of controversial thoughts that I want you to think about okay so I know when I've had a hard day in the or and you know and I need to go home and relax a bit I'll pour myself a scotch and that helps me relax that's alcohol so when Joe down the street goes home and lights up his joint or vaporizes because he's had a hard day at work he's also using the same sort of a chemical as he to chill out probably true the you know the important point that I think to make is that we have stigmatized cannabis in some pretty nasty picture right at times and and I'm not saying it's not without cause I mean there's obvious obviously that's two sides to every coin and I'm not saying that we should bury our head in the sand and say no this is a perfect perfect drug it's not at all but if we if we utilize this drug in a smart way we can we can take Joe and we can learn from Joe because maybe I shouldn't be drinking alcohol which is a class 1 carcinogen rated by the World Health Organization alcohol you know versus cannabis which is not a carcinogen right so maybe I've got something to learn from Joe and something I can think about right so just a controversial thought to see it in your brain the other thing that I want you to think about also is medicinal versus recreational use so in medicine and I'll and I'll be one of my last slides we'll be going over this but in medicine we used about 1/10 to 120th the amount of cannabinoids in medicine than a recreational user we use so a recreational user will try their their goal a recreational users goal is to get maybe high right in medicine our end goal is not to get high we consider that a side effect the the end goal is to actually treat the symptom treat the pain right so I'm losing my mic you guys can hear me ok so so we have different end goals and different amounts of the cannabis or cannabinoids we're using so when we when a recreational user smokes let's say they vaporize some cannabis they're gonna get about 10 to 20 times more of THC than we would ever use in medicine so for most my patients and by the way the average age of my cannabis cannabinoid patient is I did I just looked at the numbers last week is 71 so that's the average age of people that I'm treating with cannabis right so it's not the 30 year old coming in to want to get high right it's it's a genuine pain related and or muscle spasms sleep anxiety etc so that's the average age of patients we treat but the important thing is that the amount of THC or CBD I'm giving them is about 120th what a recreational user uses ok routes of administration so if you think about let's just think about fentanyl or morphine when you're in the hospital and you're in pain I just I don't know I I took out a kidney stone from you and you're in a lot of pain I might be inclined to give you IV morphine will give you some some morphine through the IV and within a couple of minutes you're gonna feel better ok but but when you go home you know I can't you can't go home on your IV and you can't keep feeding you IV morphine so maybe if I'm a traditional physician I'm gonna give you you know fentanyl patch or morphine or oral sulfate or some other form of oral or transdermal means of giving you the pain management or a pill right so there are different forms or activities that we give people already so cannabis or cannabinoids are no different there are different ways that we can introduce it to a patient for either acute use we're in a lot of pain or chronic use where you're where you need a low level of activity throughout the throughout the day so smoking or vaporization and I'm gonna tell you why I think smoking is horrible but let's say vaporization has a very quick onset within five minutes you have pain pain activity going on but it has a relatively shorter duration to 2 to 4 hours in your system and then it wears off all right so it's got an advantage in that if you're having an acute crises lots of pain you're getting in the medication right away oral on the other hand is something that takes longer to absorb Oh step back sorry am i leaning too much okay I'm sorry oh that's way better I can hear myself now so oral oral treatment works differently in that it takes longer to absorb it's got to go through the GI tract it's got to get absorbed into the bloodstream it's got a pass to the liver and then it gets to your system and so it takes longer to get into your system but it lasts longer six to eight hours right so it gives you that nice longevity and then there's other formats right so whether it's sprays in the mouth or transdermal patches or creams etc those are not as consistent in terms of their absorption profiles right and that's true for any medication not just cannabis all right so smoking smoking heats the cannabis up to anywhere between six and nine hundred degrees Celsius it gives off carbon carbon monoxide during their during the smoking process and it potentially may give off cancer-causing agents that are in in this plant that are being burned off now having said that we don't have any studies and it might just be because we haven't studied it adequately but we don't have any studies showing that cannabis causes lung cancer like we do for nicotine okay but maybe it'll come in the future so I don't have the answer to that so I think the safer way to go about this to say you know smoking cannabis will have the same sort of effect that nicotine might all right so it gives off cancer-causing agents the other problem is that when you smoke cannabis you lose about 30% of your cannabinoids so 30% of your cannabinoids don't come out don't actually get absorbed into your system so if you're paying I don't know four or five dollars you know per gram or whatever it is you're losing 30% of your medication right on the other hand vaporization has a much you can control it better you can heat up your cannabis or cannabinoids to a certain temperature and you get very little of the toxins coming off and you absorb a much higher amount of that medication all right so when we start to introduce our patients and usually it's two oils that's how we start most of our patients so but let's say that they're having acute crises and they're willing to try vaporization then that's the right direction we go for quick-quick absorption versus smoking which we discourage all right so driving in cannabis I just thought throw this in because I think this is an important thing to think about as well like any other medication cannabinoids are also a medicine also need to be treated with respect you can have it it's you may have some level of sedation when you take cannabinoids especially if you're taking THC for inflammation and pain it might make you sleepy when you're driving and stuff so bottom line is if you feel impaired don't drive don't operate heavy equipment don't do what you you know wouldn't normally do if you let's say if you were really tired you've been up for 48 hours and you're really tired well you wouldn't drive hopefully right or you went out with a bunch of friends and you had a bottle of wine you would drive so treat cannabis in no different way in that way be safe about it right if you know that you're that it's affecting you making you sedated then don't then just don't drive right so some of the things that did I touched upon let me just kind of give you a quick overview that I'm going to give you some some interesting take-home points here so we talked about cannabinoids and how their whole plant therapy is very beneficial because they're there they're a bunch of other terpenes and other things within the whole plant that have benefits have multiple benefits we talked about the fact that when we when we understand cannabis we understand the endocannabinoid system when we understand the endocannabinoid system we have a new system in which we understand how the pain nerves are being modulated how Sleeps been modulated how anxieties being modulated we talked a little bit about what pain was and the kind of pain that cancer can cause and the bony pain which is often inflammatory in nature or fractures and therefore cannabis having both essentially acting ability to surpass pain but also peripherally acting on the inflammation way of suppressing pain it's a it's a it's a great drug to be able to use a medication to to use for pain control and then we talked a little bit about the safety aspects of cannabis as well as I mentioned to you I highly discourage smoking I think there's multiple reasons including the fact that you don't get your medicine properly and that there is potential for cancer which you don't have evidence for but it there is potential that the fact that THC that the THC content that we use to treat pain is about one tenth or one twentieth or less than the recreational user in our practice when we prescribe cannabis we start low very low and we titrate up to get your pain management if you start to get side effects you're getting too drowsy you're getting high you're feeling couch locked or any of these side effects these are side effects of the medicine we say okay that's dial it back we have to try either a different approach or a different combination with CBD and THC because CBD does not by the way cause all those side effects so all the side effects were talking about are THC driven right so that is the sedation etc so we then change the ratio of CBD to THC and we get something that fits correctly for the patient we talked a little bit about yeah so so basically the effects of the high we talked a little bit about the recreational user versus the medical user we talked about the safety aspects and the fact that the that the brain stem does not have receptors for the cannabinoids and so it's very safe we talked about the driving issues as well so just I want to just end quickly with how the process works sorry I hope that projects okay but basically the way that that medical cannabis is being administered at this time before legalization and I and I can I can't see why that would change after legalization is currently the patient would go to their family doctor have a discussion with their family doctor about about the potential for one to try cannabis there are a bunch of resources that we are happy to provide the family doctor who may say I know nothing about it I don't think it's a good idea we are happy to educate our colleagues as well to help them understand where cannabis fits in all this once you've had that conversation either your family physician would then go ahead with the process of getting you're registered with Health Canada if they're comfortable doing that if not they would refer you to someone who does that so for example we run a clinic that does that so we would get a referral from the family doctor then one of our physicians would then see the patient do the evaluation make sure that there's they're appropriate for this one of our counselors would sit down and talk to you about what cannabis is how to use it where to get it all that kind of stuff so one important thing here is that dispensaries so there are lots and lots of dispensaries out there I'm sure there are some fantastic dispensaries some extremely knowledgeable individuals in these dispensaries but at this time dispensaries are not the legal Avenue to obtain cannabis so until we until the laws change the only place that you can legally get cannabis is through a licensed producer and a licensed producer does not have a storefront that is Health Canada's ruling so the licensed producers when they get the the information from the doctor to them they will register you you will order on their website and they will ship to you directly to your door the cannabis the cannabinoids okay the oils and the plants so at this point in time that is the only legal Avenue to get it all right I think there's I'll take that in a second and I think there's like as I said I think there's there's lots of dispensaries that are very helpful and probably have very good products but we can only speak to the legal route right now and that's the only legal route right now you had a question about that I think yeah so so growing your own is absolutely possible yes so I can I'll I'll take that into the question answer I'll just I'll just end quickly by saying that once that information is gathered we we then fax a letter into the licensed producer and you're registered with Health Canada to be able to purchase the cannabis off the websites and they get shipped right to your door the actual container that you receive it in that is your your evidence of licence as long as you leave it in the container that is how you show that you have a medical license or medical letter to use cannabis for medical reasons okay so I'm gonna end with that for now this is basically what I was just saying right now and this is just our contact information but we're not the only game in town I'm not here to promote us particularly I'm just saying that there that you family doctors can do this there are lots of physicians who are comfortable than doing cannabis work and and you can choose any any condition that can help you with that but we're helping we're happy to help through that process as well so I'm gonna end my talk there but I'm gonna take that question right off the bat and before I take other questions is that okay do I have time to take some questions okay perfect so yes you can grow for yourself again you still need it to be registered through Health Canada so what you do is you go to the physician the physician would write the letter now instead of me faxing it to the licensed producer so that you can buy from them you would then get a hard copy of that letter saying I'm authorizing you to grow or I'm giving you the letter to grow you will then take that letter with the application that's available online and you send that to Health Canada and then something happens in that black box and you get back a little sort of certificate saying that you are allowed to grow that and so that is the current yes you can do that of course that medicine is only for you and it's not to be subdued and sold and passed on to your friends or anything like that right so that's the whole idea of self growing and and so yes that is still available come legalization as I understand it you'll be able to have up to five plants I think it is per host two plants okay I thought is five plants anyways is this any way Health Canada or they will they will define exactly what that will look like you know with with legalization as well yeah sorry I didn't hear that okay so so yeah so so yeah absolutely as long as you repeat the question sorry so so the question was is there an advantage to to putting it in tea so this gets back to juicing so juicing and teas so tea is difficult because teas you have to really heat up you'd almost have to boil the cannabis it to create the tea because you need to heat it up to that level in order to activate the cannabinoids and then you can consume it in a liquid form at cannabis and cannabinoids are not water-soluble generally they are oil soluble so tea might be more difficult to actually get your medication into your body effectively right and it's gonna be erratic one day you'll have lots another you might not have enough so I think it's not a safe manner same with juicing like juicing basically works on using THC a so that's the acidic form and your and your and your extracting that but again we don't have clear evidence of where th CA and CB da fits in the pain management but more so we don't know how much and how much of it you absorb because it's liquid or acidic format versus an oil format yes yes you'll have the same sort of okay so sorry so I'll just repeat that quickly the two questions were how do you know the dosage when you're growing your own and the second one was there's other formats such as suppositories that maybe you can take and and whether that changes the side-effects I'll take the second question first and that is when you do a suppository yes that is a great way to absorb it it's just another mucosal surface just like your mouth but the side effects will be the same so if you're absorbing the medicine the medicine is what's causing the side effects you'll still get the side effects whether it's done it should be the same because it's whether you're absorbing it through the mouth or through the rectum it should give you the same effect but there are some local pelvic absorption that takes place in a different format so there might be some subtle differences I think it's individual to individual for sure but so there is some benefit to it you know right and then in terms of the dosage so that's where you need to go see you know like a cannabis clinician who can start you out in a very low dose and usually for growing we we anticipate where you might get to based on your history and what you've told us and everything and we'll say we think you're gonna get to this and so we'll we'll make sure that you've got enough of a plant count tips to get that and then we back it down and say don't take that much right off the bat start low and work your way up the ladder to get to the dose you want to get to okay I'll be around I'll be around afterwards and so I think we're running short on time and I'm happy to take questions as well and answer any questions you might thank you very much good for you", "hJAn0GwTasg": "hey all cameras huh now welcome to my youtube channel sorry for the lighting it's kind of morning so the lighting is not the bests anyways I'm checking in cuz I'm doing an edible video I have myself here a 300 milligram

I've had weaker tasting pretty good though still got half off we'll check back in unlike two hours peace", "7Yp8jcpOrz4": "hi friends I just wanted to make a video because I've had lots of questions about CBD and what it is and what I'm doing with it and I'm super excited about it so I thought I would make you a little video give you a little more background on me and what our company is and a couple products that we have that I use every day that are amazing so a little background on me I've been a massage therapist for about 13 years worked for a few chiropractors I worked in a couple high-end spas i worked at wellness center here in Fort Collins I've treated a lot of pain I've treated people that have been in car accidents I've worked with people that have spinal issues that have hormone issues that are just seeking a kind of relaxation or general kind of support for their body to feel better um I've done a lot of bodywork given thousands of massages worked with athletes pregnant women everybody so with that being said my clients kept telling me about these hemp CBD oils so I was curious and I did a little research so CBD is the non psychoactive component in cannabis it does not get you high however CBD has been medically researched and research shows that it's great for pain it's great for inflammation it's antibacterial they're just really you know I just can't say enough about it and from my own use so I use the salve every day I love it so this is our EBR salve it smells really good it's got a little sweet orange and lavender so it's just kind of light and fresh and relaxing so with that being said this is all organic raw ingredients no GMO our oil comes from hemp we're building a few greenhouses in Spokane Washington and I know that some of you have asked me about if it's tested if it's really organic and I can't say enough about the quality the purity the strength of our oils we're actually tested by a company the best company for this kind of thing in the u.s. called trace analytics out of Washington so if anyone needs more information about that please reach out to me a lot of why I chose this product and and why I researched this company was because I wanted to find someone or a company that really wanted to help people um with with this hemp CBD so that being said our products are legal in all 50 states they're very cool so the salve amazing for muscle stuff for for headaches for migraines for anxiety for just kind of general brain support it's great for supporting the nervous system so the sap is a really good way to just try something if you're not interested in ingesting the oils we also have pictures should I take every day I think they're awesome and they're actually they taste pretty good I don't know some of you have had tinctures or not but some of them are very bitter this one is not just kind of a sweet oil super yummy oh yeah so that's good for anxiety it's good for a lot of what I listed before we also have really raw pure oils for people dealing with cancer for people with epilepsy for seizures I mean these oils are just so powerful which is why I post a lot about them I talk about them a lot made my facebook public partly just because I really believe in what this is and that people should know about it and that it should be available so you can check out our website our website is EVR l.i.f.e
