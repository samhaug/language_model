It may lack the rich flavor of milk chocolate\nand the glossy brown color of dark chocolate. Many people even argue that it\u2019s not really\nchocolate at all. But today we\u2019re gonna show some love to\nthis redheaded stepchild of the chocolate world. To understand the chemistry of white chocolate\nand why so many people refuse to call it chocolate, we have to understand a little bit about how\nchocolate is made. It starts out as cacao beans, which are harvested,\nfermented, and roasted. After roasting, the beans are ground and pressed\nto remove an oily substance known as cocoa butter, and that\u2019s where our white chocolate\nis born. Because at this point, the process of making\nchocolate splits into a few different paths, generally involving how much of that cocoa\nbutter and solids is going to be involved in the final product. To make cocoa powder, most of the cocoa butter\nis removed and the remaining cocoa solids are dried. To make baking and eating chocolate, some\ncocoa butter is left in the final product, then sugar and milk fat and solids are thrown\nin. But to make white chocolate, it\u2019s all about\nthe cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is mostly made up of the fatty\nacids palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid. Those fatty acids are tied up in groups of\nthree called triglycerides. They only contribute fat-soluble flavor compounds\nof cocoa, but mix those fats with sugar, dried milk, and vanilla for a much-needed flavor\nboost, and ta-dah: we\u2019ve got white chocolate. But cocoa butter creates the velvety texture\nof eating chocolate, so we have those fatty acids to thank for that. The cocoa butter has unique melting properties\nwhich is suitable melt-in mouth during consuming. Also, this property makes white chocolate\neasy to work with when decorating confectionery, and its color contrast makes for a lovely\naccent. But what makes white chocolate stand out is\nreally more about what it\u2019s missing. The cocoa liquor, which is what chocolate\nmakers call the paste made from the roasted beans, is widely considered to be the heart\nand soul of \u201creal\u201d chocolate. That\u2019s because it has a huge variety of\nflavor compounds and other plant chemicals that give chocolate its uniquely divine flavor. But when the cocoa solids are pressed, most\nof those chemicals stay with the ground beans, not the cocoa butter. Additionally, all those purported health benefits\nof dark chocolate? The compounds thought to be beneficial -- the\npolyphenols -- are once again missing from white chocolate. It\u2019s pretty much just fat and sugar, we\u2019re\nsorry/not sorry to say. That doesn\u2019t mean people haven\u2019t tried\nto make it healthier. One research group even tried to add the essential\ndietary fatty acids EPA and DHA to white chocolate to help people boost their intake of brain-healthy\nomega-3s. And since those fats blend well with fats\nin white chocolate, it even kinda worked! We\u2019d still advise you keep it as a sometimes\nonly food, though. So that\u2019s white chocolate. Is it real chocolate? Many have asked, and we\u2019re not the boss\nof chocolate makers. We can tell you that compared to milk and\ndark chocolate, white chocolate lacks a lot of key chemistry. But it tastes nice, and it looks awfully pretty\ndrizzled over truffles. Let us know what you think in the comments. Thanks for watching.

review from lapis now we got such a good response from our last chocolate bar recipe video as we made it as accurate as possible we even went out and got heavy cream powder which was pivotal in making the perfect chocolate bar so today will be the most accurate white chocolate bar from Lindsay at the little pine calm hey everybody so after some research we found that do white chocolate recipe calls for a special ingredient that our milk chocolate recipe didn't call for which is sunflower lecithin so we'll be adding 1/4 TSP of sunflower lecithin to 4 ounces of melted cacao butter add in 1/3 cup of powdered erythritol add in 1/4 cup of heavy cream powder and add in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract [Music] now I'll pour this into our molds refrigerate it until it's solid and taste it for you [Music] the white chocolate while this keto white chocolate cutie look how adorable that is who knew food could be a driver oh wait look at this look at the happy face book is happy hmm what you think that um well I think that it tastes like when you said that you you said that it looked like vanilla batter like cake batter yeah it tastes like I think white chocolate is a lot creamier so maybe like adding more heavy whipping cream ice cream yeah I mean I don't know what to say like it is like a lot of vanilla and like the cacao butter coming through and I do feel like white child is like you said supposed to be a bit more creamy I researched what qualifies white chocolate to be white chocolate and it's supposed to be no less than 20% cacao butter and it's supposed to be no more are than 55% sweetener I think there's too much tweener yeah maybe more heavy cream powder instead and maybe like reducing the extract to like half or something if not just complete again right of it it's way too sweet for me I don't think I don't think I would say it's white chocolate though would you still give it a thumbs up like the flavors okay like it kind of reminds me more of like the vanilla bulletproof ice cream that we make more so than like a white chocolate at all it's not bad it's like I dislike it but I still want to give it a thumbs down because it's not really giving that a white chocolate vibe and it's kind of giving off like a weird flavor yeah no it is but the texture obviously was was still really good right the texture was good but there's still green enos in there then you didn't like the texture mmm no not for a chocolate bar so you give it a thumbs down I give it a thumbs up alright texture I can I give it a so-so thumb I mean not really well I can okay it this just means that it could improve what are you impressed me I think it's a good base I think it's a good way to start so it still give the recipe thumbs up but from what I read you probably do need to get some type of lecithin that's helps by the powder and the fat together it's a great emulsifier yeah I guess have you don't have sunflower less than the only way to really almost fired is with one of those like emulsion blender is right right so thank you Lindsay at the little pond calm for this white chocolate bar SP and thank you Joe Bowman for requesting this recipe we enjoyed making it we hope this video helps you make a better sheet of white chocolate bar don't forget to like this video and comment and request any recipes you want to try out for you guys and [Music] [Music]", "JZ2fRE_nkak": "I'm Amy Guittard and I'm a chocolate expert I can't go away bacon chips otherwise known as chocolate chips which if you're a home baker you're probably super familiar with these right out the gate they both look pretty similar not too much of a color difference they both have nice little tails which is what we call the tip of the baking chip so this one has a little bit of a white note to it it's called bloom it looks kind of like a white powder some people might think it's mold if the chocolate is in a hot environment and then it cools down in a not proper temperature it'll get bloom so since these look so similar let's move into tasting so first I'm gonna try this guy over here so this is a little bit sweeter the grind itself is a little bit coarser the first thing I'm tasting is not chocolate it's sugar so when you're making chocolate first you take your beans and you roast them after roasting you grind them up and make cocoa liquor or unsweetened chocolate much the same way that one would make peanut butter from peanuts you grind your peanuts to make your peanut butter you grind your cocoa nibs to get your unsweetened chocolate if you're refining on a shorter period of time your grain or your particle size is going to be larger which means that the fat that's being released in the mass itself is gonna have larger globules for it to cover so when it's on your tongue it's not going to melt as fluidly as if it were smaller particle sizes with more cocoa butter covering them so in the case of this particular chocolate I'm tasting more sugar which means that not only is the mass have a higher content of sugar but I'm guessing that maybe in the refining stage they didn't refine it as finely as another brand might sugar is probably the cheapest ingredient that you'd be adding so if a company is making a ton of chocolate chips and just pumping them out the door they might be using more of the cheaper ingredient and trying to cut down their production time which would be in the refining stage for instance which is where you're going to have something that's a little bit more sugar and a little bit larger particle size so now I'm gonna go ahead and taste B so this chocolate when I first taste it it's a really nice rich chocolate note it lingers a little bit longer on my tongue I'm tasting sugar much like I tasted this but it's certainly not the first thing I'm tasting and also as I eat this chocolate it melts really evenly on my tongue I'm not tasting a lot of particle size in it this is this is a nice standard rounded beautifully flavored cookie drop I can't go away I think B probably has been refined a little bit more I'm thinking it probably has less sugar in it than a and I'm thinking the origins that they're using are a little bit different than a as well so I'm gonna go ahead and guess that I think B is probably the more expensive one but let's do that make me feel oh it is but just by a little bit huh the shape is the same this has white on it but I don't think that it's due to bloom it might be due to just scuffing and transportation this particular chocolate is very sugar forward and the grains in the chocolate as it melts on my tongue are really prominent so for your bang for your buck you're getting a whole lot more flavor for just $1 more in these guys than you are for these guys so it looks like we've got some milk chocolate here and I can figure that out just by the color and just off the bat taking a look at them the color is pretty similar this is a little bit lighter brown this is a little bit of a darker brown but what I'm noticing more other than the color is just the texture that you have in the chocolate itself in the case of this one you can tell that the particle size is a little bit larger and so when you break it and you've got that rough edge that to me is a clear sign that there might be a lesser quality milk chocolate happening here typically with a milk chocolate you can have dark milk so you can have lighter milk so just in looking at these one might think that just because it's darker it might have more cocoa in it but the only way to find out is to taste it so let's start with a I'm gonna do chocolate you have to let it melt on your mouth so what I'm tasting with this it's a really bright fresh berry note with milk chocolate you're not necessarily looking for chocolate flavor you're really looking for milk flavor that complements chocolate so in this case it's a really upfront fresh dairy note the chocolate flavor is there it's a nice clean palate it lingers quite nicely on on my tongue as I let it melt and this is a really nice even melt as well now let's try beep gosh this is so soft so this is um super almost like metallic II I don't really get chocolate I don't really get milk I get a really sort of burned in the back of my throat flavor so my guess here is that the dairy that's being used in this might be coming from a higher quality dairy farm versus the dairy that's being used in this this could very well be grass-fed dairy versus this although sometimes that really affects the flavour sometimes it doesn't this might be a happier cow than this guy so I'm guessing that with be the processing has probably been shortened a little bit maybe the refining process wasn't as laborious or thoughtful as it was in a but let's do the big reveal as suspected a definitely is the more expensive with be the particle sizes again are quite large which makes it a little bit difficult to melt evenly on my tongue and it's also impacting the total fat that's in the product and how it melts on my tongue which is giving again that waxy note which is all a product of how it's being manufactured or produced in factory my biggest hunch about this significant price difference is not only the quality of dairy that's being used but also the time that's going into manufacture this something with this level of graininess and sort of lack of depth just in the general delivery of milk and chocolate leads me to believe that it's probably more of a commodity that they're just pumping out large volumes of this particular chocolate as opposed to this this is really an art and a science it's being delivered here in the case that maybe you're doing a lot of volumes say with s'mores I would maybe consider going with with the cheaper version but in most cases you're really going to be able to tell the difference from a really high quality milk chocolate versus a lower quality cheaper milk chocolate so if you can handle the price difference I would always say with try and go it to go with the more expensive one okay so we've got white chocolate the elusive white chocolate well first of all you can't call white chocolate white chocolate with the word chocolate in it unless it has 20 percent minimum cocoa butter what does someone maybe replace the cocoa butter with something that's probably cheaper which is oftentimes like a vegetable fat these are both white products whether they're both white chocolate we'll soon find out this is an even white color this is more of a yellowish color which leads me to believe that it might be more natural so when you think chocolate you think Brown and that Brown is coming from the solids that are in the unsweetened chocolate with white chocolate it's white because it doesn't have any of the cocoa solids in it it's just made up of cocoa butter which without the solids is clear this particular product over here is so bright white that it might have an additive added to it to even out the color and drop out any off colors that one might not want in their end product so now it's time to taste I'm gonna actually start with this one over here just because I think it looks tastier um why not so as suspected it is melting quite evenly on my tongue fun fact cocoa butter melts at your body's temperature so this particular product is melting quite quickly I can taste some sugar but for the most part it's a really fresh dare you know it has a little bit of citrus to it and it's a really creamy mouthfeel it's really clean moving on to B let me taste this one now I'm a little scared because it looks a little bright wait it's always scary when it comes to food mmm this is not melting as easily and fluidly as this one which makes me think that this probably is not a white chocolate I'm thinking this is probably has a fair amount of vegetable fat in it alternatively to the cocoa butter so I'm thinking this is probably a compound I also think that this is a fair amount of vanilla added into it it's that's pretty much all I'm tasting is vanilla and sugar when I taste this guy and again the most important sort of cue to me when I'm tasting this is that it's not melting evenly it's really sticky and waxy on my mouth and the roof of my mouth so I'm gonna go ahead and say that this is probably a compound this is probably a white chocolate and I'm gonna say that this is probably significantly more expensive than this one okay big reveal aha so this as suspected is a bit more pricey than this one you don't have twenty percent minimum cocoa butter in your final product you can't call it chocolate and most of the time if something is a pure chocolate it's got a little bit of a yellower hue to it you add vegetable fat in you're replacing the cocoa butter with something that is more stable might not require tempering as I thought this probably has a significant amount of sugar in it compared to this which it has some cocoa butter in it some sugar and just a really beautifully made white chocolate okay so it looks like we've got some cocoa powders here I guess first things that I notice about these guys is that they look like they're natural cocoa powders I say that because most of them are a little bit they're both a little bit on the lighter side if something's Dutch twitch means adding sodium bicarbonate it's a dutching agent which makes the cocoa powder turn a little bit darker I'm also noticing that this one over here is slightly darker than than this one here if they're already natural cocoa powders they tend to have more moisture in them the moisture tends to make the cocoa powder a little bit darker cocoa powder is made by taking unsweetened chocolate and putting it in a hydraulic press and pressing it with so much pressure that you're separating your cocoa powder from your cocoa butter so you're basically you have your solids and your fats they're both sort of light and fluffy they've got some grain to them but I guess the next step for me to figure out which one is better is if I taste them hey Justine thought it a little bit jerky so the first thing I noticed when I taste this one is that it's really quite burned so that means that they were probably roasting the liqueur quite high before they made the cocoa powder and the other thing that I noticed is that the flavor profile on my tongue doesn't linger it sort of sort of hits my tongue and then the chocolate flavor stops okay now I'm gonna try this other one I don't know why I can't do this without my own when I taste this one the first thing I'm tasting it's a nice rounded deep chocolate note it's not burned it's a really sort of light fresh it's still chocolatey and you can still taste it's been roasted but it's definitely not a high roasted liquor that's probably being used in this I'm also noticing that the flavor once it hits my tongue lasts a little bit longer it lingers a little bit more and that's a sign of some of a higher quality cocoa powder as well when you're trying to select which cocoa powder to use your want to have make sure that it's got full flavor full chocolate flavor as well as a nice long lingering flavor profile I'm gonna go ahead and say that B is probably the more expensive of the two yep B B it is so this one's definitely obviously more expensive I didn't think that it was gonna be that much more expensive but I think some of the things that might be happening here is it could very well be an organic cocoa powder it might have some certifications on it as well like a fair trade or rain forest Alliance certified the really important part is that it's delivering a really strong chocolate flavor with Dutch cocoa powders you're oftentimes getting more of a cocoa flavor cooked salty flavored in a the flavor profile of the chocolate isn't super chocolaty it's more burned than chocolate but there's definitely some some uniqueness going on here that's lacking in this one which is probably where the price difference is coming from okay so it looks like we have a super dark chocolate here a chocolate bar the other thing that I'm noticing with this as well is this one over here on it B has a fair amount of air bubbles in it the air bubbles don't necessarily affect the quality of the chocolate but it definitely impacts my perception of the quality of the chocolate so in this case with the air bubbles there it makes me think that maybe there was something that was lacking in the way that it was processed or the attention to detail that went into making this chocolate so let me go ahead and taste this one so I'm guessing it's probably in the 80% range I knew it was a dark chocolate by the by the color of it but it's definitely a really deep rich dark chocolate there's not a lot going on in terms of complexity there's a little astringency at the end of it but the flavor the deep chocolate flavor notes is really coming up upfront and then it lingers throughout as I'm finishing eating it so this definitely tastes like something that I could eat a lot of we call that Moorish where you just want more of it and if it's not something that you can eat a lot of it might be a single origin we call that sipping chocolate where you might just want a little bit and you're satisfied you can't have too much of it now I'm going to go ahead and try this one B so this is very different from this one it's a little bit more extreme it's not a really rounded flavor profile it I think it's probably a single origin I definitely wouldn't be able to have a lot of this so when I taste both of these they both melt rather evenly on my tongue there's not a significant difference in terms of particle size like we are commenting on earlier the main difference is just flavor development on my palate when I eat them my guess is that B is probably more expensive but I really have no idea so I guess let's take a look and see what the difference is oh my goodness why is that say five hundred and fifty dollar the bar I thought there would be difference but I didn't think it would be this much this is surprising I didn't even know there was a bar that was five hundred and fifty dollars maybe they have a direct relationship with the farm and there might be a component like an heirloom cacao component to this I'm not entirely sure I don't think the air bubbles necessarily affect the quality but it definitely gives an appearance of a lower quality chocolate bar I might just want a really delicious chocolate bar that I can eat in one or two or ten bites I might want this for a special occasion where I'm pairing it with something at a dinner party I don't know if I would pay that much personally don't forget this is still a seven dollar chocolate bar which isn't a cheap chocolate bar from the grocery store it's still a really high-quality chocolate but you know the big takeaway here is that you know you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to buy a really good bar of chocolate there's a time and a place for when you would want to buy an expensive chocolate bar whether it's seven dollars or in some cases what is it 550 so I'm hoping the big takeaway from today is that prices and everything that it's really important to taste the chocolate that you are choosing between if you want to go with an 89 cent chocolate bar great if that satisfies your craving if you want to spend five hundred and fifty dollars on a single origin chocolate perfect hopefully you learned something here that will make it easier when you're at the store trying to make some decisions around what chocolate to buy", "ugsOtrUEZ50": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so today i will gonna show you how to make a white chocolate milk bar this is super easy guys and just only three ingredients but before we start please do like subscribe to my channel and don't forget to hit the notification bell below so that you always be notified if i have a new video so guys let's start doing it so guys this is our ingredients this is powdered milk 2 tbsp and then this is powdered sugar 1 4 cup and this is 100 gram unsalted butter so i have a mold here if you have a chocolate mold you can use this but i have a pluto mold so that i will gonna use so let's start first you need to boil water like this i already put this and i'm just waiting for it to boil so now it boils we're gonna put bowl on it [Music] and make sure the tip of your bowl will not gonna reach that you're not gonna touch the water the boiling water you're just gonna melt this butter totally melt the butter i have a glass bowl but i'm not sure it can handle the heat so i just use a stainless ball and if you have a glass bowl guys make sure that it can handle the heat okay because it might gonna be break so to make sure just use a stainless like this but if you have you can use that just you know make sure that it will not gonna break so we will just melt this milk milk melt so the butter is all melted all so we're gonna put the powdered sugar so i'm just gonna scrape it because it's stuck on my 1 4 cup this is 1 4 cup okay so let's just melt this properly you need to melt this sugar properly so that if you bite on your milk bar chocolate milk bar it will gonna [Music] melt on your mouth properly not like you were gonna taste like because if this will not gonna melt it will like um you know the filling of sand it will gonna feel like that in your tongue so you should melt this properly [Music] so now the sugar is melted you need to put the milk just like that keep on mixing then like that and then after 30 seconds of mixing turn off the heat turn off the plane i mean because this is we were gonna cook it with the heat of the boiling water so you need to turn off the fire so just mix mix it like that and then wait for it until it combines well just now you see the butter is still separating so you need to mix it more until the butter combines to milk and then to the sugar so just keep on mixing like that see it's starting to combine all together [Music] so just mix mix this is a good exercise mix mix mix [Music] do [Music] so guys this is all combined together the sugar melts properly and then the milk and then the butter it all combines together so it should be look like this smooth and silky see when i use my spatula on it it's just see how very nice looking our chocolate mixture is so we this is ready to be pour we will just pour pour in the mold so we will just gonna take this out already and you should put it on the mold after you take those out in the hot water okay so now this is the mold that i have this is silicone mold this is for my pluto but if you have a chocolate mold you can use like that but if you don't have you can use your silicone mold there because it's easy to use the silicone mold even if you don't put oil on it because it will be just take out like that and it will gonna take out smoothly so guys this is super easy and this is creamy and soft like melts on your mouth white chocolate so i have two extra so like this and then let's put it on the fridge for two to four hours until it's set and then this is ready to eat [Music] so guys this is our chocolate white chocolate milk so it sits already i just put it on fridge i didn't put it on the freezer i just put it on the fridge and after two hours it sits already see how smooth and silky our chocolate is and this chocolate it melts on your mouth really you can put it on the freezer if you like maybe for 30 minutes it will gonna get hard it's much better to use a silicone mold so that it will gonna take off easily and the shape will not be destroyed so if you don't have silicone mold you can use a paper cup just like what i did with this see it takes up fine too it looks fine too so use a silicon or paper cup if you have [Music] so that's it for our video guys so don't forget to like and subscribe to my channel and don't forget to click the notification bell below so that you will gonna always be notified notified if i have a new video so bye guys i'll just eat this chocolate chocolate [Music] you", "rlUKisosxXE": "[Music] good afternoon

been longing for the return of the Cadbury's dream bar for far too long it's been off the shelves for at least five years now probably five to ten years it's been a long long time since I've seen one I have since had the pleasure of eating an Australian dream bar which I would link for you down below that was an exquisite experience but it wasn't quite the same so when I saw that Cadbury were releasing a white chocolate I was like  get me there now because I don't know why they got rid of the dream bar it was gorgeous it was almost pure sugar in the most wonderful way so I'm hoping that the Cadbury white and its creamy white chocolate can stand up to my fond memories of the dream bar so this chocolate comes in a 180 gram pack which is pretty big pretty decent value considering on the page two pens I found this in my local big Asda store there are also quite chocolate buttons to be found and I think another kind of children's chocolate snack sized things but if this big boy is you know this this is what we're here for this has been out for a couple of weeks but I've only just been able to find it and today right now actually not just today right this minute I'm gonna taste it for you guys and let you know whether it's worth the hype and whether it's worth your hard-earned cash so usually Cadbury are known for their milk chocolate and occasionally for their dark chocolate in the form of Bournville so to see this white chocolate bar is very and to see just what it looks like is even more exciting look at this funkiness they have gifted us it was lost a very unexpected pattern on there so instead of just the usual kind of chunky rounded cube shapes that you would get from a daily milk this has texture it's got smooth chunks it's got kind of wavy ones and rough ones it's a bit of a nightmare for shading and breaking off with people because I'd be much happier to receive this than to receive this one but it looks cool I must say the smell isn't too much like a Cadbury's dream which I always thought was quite a distinctive tasting white chocolate this just smells like a cheap but nice white chocolate which I love so anyway enough chat let's get into this Cadbury's white and see if it's worth it decent snap on it so we like the thickness here there is a good kind of chunkiness to this bar which we are always happy to see when we're paying 2 pounds for it it's got a nice kind of shine on top which a lot of daily milk products don't so it is quite nice to see that let's get our teeth into a couple of chunks of this Cadbury white and see how it is not gonna live that mostly just tastes like a very generic white chocolate I won't lie to you I'm kind of underwhelmed basically that just tastes like a very generic basic white chocolate while it's decent and the white chocolate is always good because it's creamy it's ridiculously sweet and it tastes vaguely of vanilla it's nice but it doesn't taste like a Cadbury's dream it has a good texture in it's that kind of nice balance that white chocolate has between super creamy and a little bit of chalkiness it's thick which makes it very satisfying when you've got a whole kind of mouthful of it and I must say after Eva sorry and I must say after even three chunks of it I'm kind of done with that level of sweetness it is very rich very very sweet so 180 grams are not is very very good value because this would last me quite a while and trust me I am a greedy you know while I don't really have that much negative to say about it because it is exactly just a creamy white chocolate there is nothing specifically Cadbury and taste about this in thickness in texture yes but in flavor very generic not even as kind of distinct or recognizable as a milky bar for example pretty much if you would like to try it I wouldn't discourage you from buying it it's certainly something new and it's nice to see Cadbury doing new things it might be nice for us to encourage them to do that is it as impressive as the orange twirl is it's impressive as the winter gingerbread bar no to both is it ok and does it do what it says on the wrapper yeah I'll give it a three out of five something that would be very exciting is if we see this Cadbury white used to launch kind of other flavors you know if they wanted to add some lemon flavoring to it if they wanted to add some kind of cookie pieces or some you know anything that you could do to jazz up just a plain chocolate bar as they do with their regular daily milk bars if we see some new versions that could be really fun but as it is now if you guys have tried the Cadbury white do you let me know what you think about it am I being too harsh or am I being too fair let me know what you think if you guys enjoyed today's video don't forget

the kitchen, they bake cookies, they bake cakes, they bake all kinds\nof things. And this is what those companies who sell\nthings like marshmallows or chocolate chips or whatever it is live for. But unfortunately, according to a new class\naction lawsuit, one company is selling a form of white chocolate chips that may not be chocolate\nat all. Joining me now to talk about this is Scott\nHardy with Top Class Actions and Scott as somebody who watches food network pretty much\nnonstop, white chocolate is technically not chocolate because it does not contain any\nof the cocoa solids, but white chocolate is in fact a thing. But this lawsuit against Ghirardelli says,\nokay, we understand white chocolate's not necessarily chocolate by definition, but you're\nnot even giving us white chocolate. You're giving us a bunch of things that you\nconcocted in a lab and you're calling that white chocolate. This is, you know, pretty deceptive of a company\nthat's been around for a long time, you know, pretty well respected in the candy world and\nso tell us what's going on now. Yeah. Ghirardelli, I mean, you go to their, their\nfactory, their store when you're in San Francisco, they make delicious chocolates. I myself am a fan, but then you have this\nclass action that was filed because as you said, white chocolate, yes, it's not real\nchocolate. But what they're doing here is they're just\nadding flavors to their hydrogen, hydrogenated and palm oils, hydrogenated oil and palm oil\nand then coloring and selling this stuff as white chocolate chips. And that's the issue. But the, the funny thing is, is that they\nwere hit with a class action and settled it back in 2014. Back in 2014 it was a very, very, very similar\nclass action settlement. And so we're trying to take a look at this\nand say, what, did Ghirardelli just forget? Were they acquired, so then the new acquisition\nmade that they didn't have to abide by the terms of the class action settlement from\n2014? Did those terms expire and so Ghirardelli\njust went back to marketing it in the same way? I'm not quite certain yet. The team's looking at both class actions to\nsee exactly what's happening. But it's surprising that you have an established\nbrand that's trusted and loved like Ghirardelli, come back and get hit with a class action\nthat they already settled five years ago. You know, and again, this is a trusted company. You know, Ghirardelli is known for chocolate. That is what they do. And so if you're out there baking, you want\nto have the best thing possible. So you do reach for these, you know, Ghirardelli\nwhite chocolate chips. You pay a little bit more for them, but you\nthink you're getting a better product and that, you know, is something we talk about\nall the time. You pay a little more because you think you're\ngetting something a little bit better. But as this lawsuit states, you're not using\nany of the cocoa fats, which is what makes it actually white chocolate. Instead, you're using the other oils that\nyou're just mixing together and claiming that this is white chocolate. You've somehow managed in a lab to mimic the\nflavor of it to an extent. They're also claiming it's obviously quite\ninferior to real white chocolate, so they've got a good case because this one's going to\ncome down to science. You know, you're going to be able to look\nat this, you're going to be able to test this. They're going to be able to find out what's\nactually in there and again, knowing that they have, as you pointed out, done this in\nthe past, their own history is working against them on this one. It really is, I mean you got hit with it five\nyears ago, oh, please just do the right thing. Maybe put the premium ingredients that we\nexpect from Ghirardelli in your chocolate. Because if you're looking at, in the grocery\nstore and you're making a yummy Christmas treat or Hanukkah treat or holiday treat for\nyour family and you're taking a look there and you see the Ghirardelli brand and you\nsee the generic brand, the store brand, well of course you're going to go for the Ghirardelli\nbrand. But it'd be crazy if that store brand actually\nhas the premium ingredients that you were expecting in that Ghirardelli chocolate. So I'm hoping that they go ahead and address\nthe labeling or even better, just go for the premium stuff. Give us that premium Ghirardelli taste that\nwe love when we go to Ghirardelli square in San Francisco and, and eat that chocolate. Right, I mean, the consumers are already paying\nfor the superior product, so all you've got to do is actually give us what we're paying\nfor and we're going to be happy. But at the same time, obviously with this\nlawsuit, you need to go ahead and compensate us in some form for the inferior product that\nyou duped us into buying. For more information about this particular\nissue, please follow the link in the description of this video.

you like what you see here please consider doing so now today's recipe is going before either a ketogenic white chocolate or a ketogenic cookies and cream bar depending on how you want to make it now these bars are actually for net carbs per two point an ounce bar to put that in perspective the same two point eight ounces of Lilly's chocolate is eight net carbs so if you have a sweet tooth and you're trying to save some carbs please consider this recipe because everybody's loved it so far with that guys hang on tight cuz I'm gonna show you how to make it let's start with the ingredients first we have 10 ounces of cacao butter 7 ounces of heavy whipping cream powder between four and four and a half ounces of powdered LeConte oh monk fruit sweetener 1/4 teaspoon of salt one ounce of cacao nibs that I have crushed a little bit further and additionally we're going to be using 1/2 a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this acts as an emulsifier if you're in a humid climate and it also helps us thin out the chocolate if you don't have a double boiler do what I'm doing and add enough water to a pot to where it does not touch the bottom of a glass bowl heated over medium heat and allow your cacao butter to melt this willing to become completely liquid and you'll want it to exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit for this you can use a candy thermometer or I'm just using a meat thermometer make sure it's not touching the bottom of the bowl once as it exceeded 120 degrees it's good to remove so use some oven mitts and a pot holder to take it off the heat and place it on the pot holder you don't want to put this on a cold surface and risk shattering your glass at this point the cacao butter is ready to start making our chocolate so we're going to add our monk fruit sweetener [Music] our powdered heavy whipping cream and our salt save the sunflower lecithin and the cacao nibs for later at this point give it a really good mix make sure there are no clumps in there you're gonna continue mixing this later so it doesn't have to be perfect right now but get it as good as you possibly can now I'm going to leave my thermometer in the chocolate mixture and wait for it to cool down to 85 degrees Fahrenheit this can take some time so every now and again go ahead and stir it once it's close to 85 degrees save 8687 add your half a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this can help thin it out help the tempering process and again if you are in a more humid climate it'll help the fats and the waters mix together this is known as an emulsifier once you're out of 85 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna put it back on the double boiler over medium heat and bring it up to about 90 to 91 degrees Fahrenheit be careful because it does come up very quickly and you don't want to overheat it I would make sure that you're mixing the chocolate the entire time you're getting it up to temperature so that it stays in even temperature now we're gonna go ahead and pour it into our molds you'll notice that I can be a little bit messy here and I'm doing this on purpose because those extra drippings that get on my parchment paper or on the sides of the mold I'm gonna use for something which I will explain later but just go ahead and fill your molds with the chocolate since I am making a half and half cookies and cream in white chocolate batch I'm gonna pour half my molds with the white chocolate and then I'm gonna go ahead and add my cacao nibs and pour the other half of the molds keep in mind if you wanted to do a whole batch of cookies and cream go ahead and use two ounces of cacao nibs instead and then mix them in right before you start pouring as you can see I have over poured this a lot more than I was planning on it so there's a very very simple solution to here make sure all the pockets on your mold are full then take an additional mold and just kind of run your rubber scraper across the top to pull off some of the excess chocolate you could leave it there and just have them all connected now we're gonna cool it for about three to four hours I like to leave mine overnight before we try to remove them from the mold at this point they should just peel off because they are silicone molds I don't spray them with anything though I'm sure you could if you were worried about it sticking I don't find a need to do it look at how satisfying this one is it is a perfect chocolate bar pop and these little guys out can be a trick but just push up from the bottom and pull earlier I mentioned that I like to save all the scraps from the mold and parchment papers so what I do is I just kind of bang the molds on the parchment paper to bring all the chocolate off of the mold then what I do is I store them in a plastic bag in my cabinet and use them in place of chocolate chips or anything that I'd want to put white chocolate chunks in this is a great use of the scraps so you're not wasting any of your chocolate and here is our finished product and now that you guys have seen the recipe it is time for the taste test now before I taste it I just want to let you know if you like a real waxy brittle chocolate going up the cow butter by about 10 or 20 percent I like mine a little bit softer so it melts in your mouth but it's all personal preference so what I have here is I have one of the cookies and cream pieces that we made in one of the white chocolate pieces but we're gonna taste them both so here we go now the white chocolate is delicious it is creamy it is sweet and it's very smooth in your mouth it kind of is exactly what what chocolate should be not to mention I did throw a little salt in there see if that kind of salty after kick which is a personal favorite of mine now let's try the cookies and cream one now on the cookies and cream one it is absolutely delicious as well because it is using the same base as the white chocolate and if you like took accountants they are definitely a great addition to this it adds some crunch to break up the smoothness if that's something you're into but both of these reps apiece are absolutely phenomenal they are shelf-stable and you can throw them in a backpack purse and take them anywhere which is what my favorite thing about them is with that guys I'm going to go ahead and close up the video if you liked the video leave it a like if you have any questions or comments

even gonna get into get into the debate of whether it's chocolate or not people want to know how to make it let me show you how to make it okay if you've tried dark chocolate or milk chocolate this is like falling off a log this is simple so the reason it's actually called chocolate still is it's from it does start with chocolate but you know you've got your beans your nibs and they press out the cocoa butter the remaining cake goes goes off turns into cocoa powder what's left is cocoa butter right there cocoa butter that's why it's called white chocolate so because it is based from it so anyway there's not as much variation as you as dark and milk with white you've only got three ingredients you're kind of hand-tied a little bit about how much you can vary stuff you get too far outside of the window and it either doesn't taste like milk chocolate or you have trouble flowing and well there you go so I found this recipe works pretty well and so here it goes again as I always do I tend to work and make things in one kilogram batches for my test ones you can scale them up accordingly so four kilogram we've got 1/3 of each of these 333 grams I didn't cut the gram in half so 333 grams of cocoa butter 333 grams of sugar 333 grams of milk powder Melchior cocoa butter add your you know preferably heated sugar and heated milk powdered your Malaga let it go for 24 hours you're going to avoid chocolate it's pretty much that simple a couple other little details you know the reason I pick a third of these aside from it being simple is you know that puts it at a 33 percent fat content if you watched or remember the milk chocolate you want to try to keep your chocolates around 35% yes it's a little under but this is a full fat milk powder it contains some milk fat that contributes in and gives you the extra fat you need same deal with like the note chocolate was you've got a couple optional ingredients if you want to add them you've got lecithin soy lecithin again totally optional not required if you want to add it it'll again help reduce the viscosity a little bit the other good reason for this in all of your chocolates if you're going to be into cooking with your chocolates it tends to help emulsify when you add a liquid in so if you're making your ganache for instance it won't separate out you know it's just a little helpful not required same deal vanilla beans there's not a lot of flavor here I mean you've got a really light chocolate flavor sugar I do use a slightly unrefined one but it's just a little richness there's not much flavor there and milk powder you know again there's some flavor but I mean we're talking about white chocolate so a lot of people associate vanilla with white chocolate it really comes through one or two of in Ella beans your call you know add more if you want I split them down the center I scrape out the seeds I add them to my warmed milk or excuse me my warmed cocoa butter let them steep 15 minutes 20 minutes half an hour whatever it's screaming it for you pull out the utter the outer beans leave the scrape seeds inside and proceed on a last thing you know for as well as I or as much as I sell it we've got two varieties of cocoa butter you've got a natural cocoa butter which is a pressing of a roasted bean has a it's actually got a really nice rich aroma and I like what it contributes to the to actually all the chocolates my preference is always natural and it's what it's just called and it's in contrast to a deodorized cocoa butter very much paler what they do is actually add it to or put it into boiling water many of the impurities a lot of color a lot of the flavor a lot of the aroma leach into the water they let it cool solidify it and they pull up the video rised there's lacking enough flavor here already I don't know why you'd want to do it but to each his own some people do but that's my take that's about it for white chocolate it's it's pretty simple but again come watch how to do it and thanks alright we are making white chocolate here or more to the point I guess well I guess we're making it there's nothing to finish up on the other two chocolates that you may have watched a milk chocolate and dark chocolate we had nibs to worry about this is none of that so I've got equal portions of natural cocoa butter some milk powder and some sugar they're all going to go into the Malaysia and 24 hours from now we're going to have white chocolate so yeah let's get it going Oh before I started actually a quick note about the malai sure it's another in my collection this one's from premier also it has neat little tilting function function that allows you to pour the chocolate out again I don't carry this one you go look up Indy chocolate ind i chocolate they've got them a great little company so anyway get it going get the cocoa butter in just want to stop that just a second because it's so loud but I wanted to make sure I made a point that cocoa butter is up at about 300 degrees I can see a little bit of the smoke coming off it's mostly because it's cold in here actually it's not really smoke but it again help speed up the bowl and let's just add these ingredients pretty quickly also gives a lot of energy to actually letting some flavors develop so feel free to heat it up to you know 200 300 if you want doesn't really start smoking until for burning hotter than that so bring it on up it's okay gives you a nice buffer zone sort of like hitting the ground running so anyway off we go okay he goes the sugar and this is just going to easily go all in okay all the sugar made it in and we can start getting the milk powder in now again nice and easy not too fast and again not unlike the milk chocolate and the others this we may have to give this a couple minutes to refine down to be able to go in and not clump up but we'll see I need to search it doing it a little bit of clumping here but not too bad see if we get it all in certainly is quieting down you can tell and I actually think we're going to make it in yep there we go it is all in it's pretty viscous it's like a pretty thick cake batter at the moment but that's going to thin down you know I'm going to give the same exact recommendations to you is you know leave off your lid for about three hours milk especially likes is is hydroscopic it likes to absorb moisture after you've heated sugars they do too so there's a little bit in there and even though we don't have the cocoa solids that might seize it I'd rather not take the chance I actually have never officially seized white chocolate and I don't want to try it so just get into that habit leave it off for three hours come back tomorrow you know 24 hours we can show you how to temper it up that's metals we said for white chocolate have a good one Thanks", "YUKvg5F3AEE": "hey folks uh if you're keeping count this is uh food video number three uh of what again i hope will be many uh today i have something that i picked up at the fye store at the mall this company called uh astrid chocolates which i really hadn't heard of before did a whole series of saturday night live based chocolate bars uh each of them is based on a different sketch this was really the only one that really interested me in terms of doing a video about most of them are pretty uh pretty ordinary this one was actually the uh drunk uncle which is a character played by bobby moynihan as a long time cast member on saturday night live he's a funny guy drunk uncle's probably one of his better characters and this flavor is uh milk chocolate dill pickle and dark chocolate bourbon so definitely something a drunk uncle might eat i don't know i never get drunk but i'm gonna try it for you and tell you how it tastes this one should be pretty weird some of the other flavors they had were david s pumpkin's pumpkin spice chocolate bar they had the sweaty balls chocolate bar which uh sounded kind of interesting they didn't have any when i was there they were sold out of that one otherwise i'd be adding this to the video too let's get this unwrapped hopefully it's not too broken let's see that's what it looks like the green on one side chocolate on the other looks pretty dark that's a little broken it's a little reddish in the middle smells like chocolate and pickles i don't know if these are flavored throughout or if each side is a different flavor but check it out kind of a very subtle flavor i do definitely taste a little bit of a sourness from the pickle it's not terribly strong i'm going to try the other side now see if that's different okay kind of is the same flavor throughout nothing too wild i mean i have pretty unusual taste so something like this might be right up my alley but uh really not very uh strong it's kind of subtle uh it's not something i would probably buy all the time but uh just as a taste test you know as a one-time thing maybe a gag gift which i'm sure is what they meant it for it's actually not bad it's pretty good you know the pickle is really kind of masked by the other flavors in this so again you know it's mostly just the name that's that's uh the selling point here really can't taste much of anything different um there's it's not regular chocolate it's not plain not ordinary but if you had uh given this to me in a blind test taste test i probably wouldn't be able to tell you what it was but anyway that's it pretty good uh we'll see you later thanks okay hold up i did that all wrong uh this video the first half of it was one of the very first videos that i decided to film and i was a little nervous and unsure of myself and in my haste uh it turns out i didn't really taste that chocolate too much i mean i chewed it put it in my mouth and swallowed it but there's a big difference especially with these types of chocolates uh between you know just eating it and actually tasting it and and you know letting the flavors run around there in your mouth i had a little bit of this bar left over and not wanting to let any of it go to waste i tried it again and i realized that uh i probably should revisit this flavor and so i have actually some more here and i'm going to go ahead and taste it and the thing is with chocolate you kind of let it need to let it sit on your tongue but the flavor is especially something this complex this is a you know it's a bourbon dark chocolate and dill pickle uh you kind of let the flavors need to let the flavors sit on your tongue for a while before you can really taste them i'm gonna go ahead and do that now so i realized uh trying this before what i had missed out on was you know a lot of the complexity that's in this bar uh you actually do you know letting it melt on the tongue get a really good uh dark chocolate flavor and uh there's just a hint on the back end of uh sourness from a dill pickle it definitely comes through i taste a little bit of the bourbon like i said i'm not you know i don't drink so i'm not big on uh on alcohol but i do enjoy you know the flavor in in food sometimes and and this is actually really pleasant and uh you know the more i eat of it you let it sit in your mouth the more these flavors really come through and it turns out this is this is actually a really good candy bar it's kind of unusual and you know got unique flavors going for it uh not everybody's gonna be into chocolate and pickles but uh i mean if you try it i'd imagine that you'd actually be pleasantly surprised it's actually a really good candy bar and i have been enjoying it a lot lately since i first made the you know the first half of the video and i actually really recommend this is actually pretty good well that's about it thanks you", "AL2Zi5ZAo4A": "ta heaven and I are going to be trying to Ritter sport bars these were sent to us from Sarah in California so thank you to Sarah now this is the white chocolate and poor Blake's with little crispy rice pieces and I have the cashew the chocolate no I'm assuming the hotel it's yeah it's no chocolate that says new mine does not but it sounds wonderful I love milk chocolate lover for barks anyway for good and so you can see get which one you this way you're gonna Kevin's gonna show you you get small squares but then when I show you the back yeah the back is full of white crispy what looks good crispy bases yeah that's pretty full even all his goods halfway up that bar but the texture they're white taught us just not a sweet know-it-all it is good but I would not fight again no it really it lacks a little sweetness that I'm used to yes I think milky flavor like a cream flavor I agree completely it's it's like they added a lot of creaminess to it but they left out the sugar um it's it's good full of cornflakes full of stuff mm-hmm it's just not sweet I think of her in the in the Europe in general when they do white anything it's usually more cream flavor right because we've had other things that were white and it's like this is cream yeah and it tastes yeah they basically taste the same no but we've had we have had white chocolate that tastes just like it's just as sweet as our American problem I think over there they consider it like sickly sweet though because they're not used to it so we're not trying to insult anyone no it's just a difference on what you grow up with either we grow up in America with very very sugary sweet things you know that's not necessarily a good thing so for us that just doesn't quite make it but now this is the milk chocolate cashew and Kevin can show you the stuff in this way what is cool I love the things they make sure they fill their bars these are a pounds each square is what would you say like 33 34 counters Reserve boards yeah something like that calories apiece yeah  the chocolate mm-hmm once again it's good but it is not a really sweet no these are in the cap cheese really they're really don't taste a lot of cashews I think that milk chocolate is a very creamy milk chocolate and there is sweetness to it there's definitely more sweetness in that milk chocolate one is the wire so that is opposite of how it would be here because over here the white would be so much sweeter um and the cashews aren't really really strong but I like the texture of them I think they had a really great texture yeah and these both of these bars are good but by no means my favorite fritters for ours no they're out oh yeah there are so many rares for bars and they do sell them in America you just have to look for them I know they have a larger selection at like The Fresh Market they have a good variety there it seems but I think you can get rid of sport bars many different places I think world market sells a lot of them I think we won't work on ourselves the the small ones the the little ones yeah the world yeah so you can get these in a lot of different places and there's so many to choose from that's the good thing about these is that if you're not crazy about one then just try another one because they're very very good quality chocolate so Sarah thank you so much for thinking of us we really appreciate it and thanks for watching [Music]", "PSYJ5FY9Pag": "today Canada not going to be trying some Bustani chocolates here these are Belgium chocolates they are all shaped of like a rose they're out pretty cool in the Valentine's outlet right now at Walmart for Valentine's Day there was two dollars fifty cents each I have the white chocolate raspberry the milk chocolate you don't you know what I didn't realize this said raspberry so why don't we try just when we try that with a fast yeah let's try just a much time at first now biscotti we tried some but funny chocolates at Christmas time they were different from these though so if you're interested in seeing that just type in on my channel mastani or type in Tammy dentist on e on YouTube and you'll see it so it's a it looks more right shape in here it's it's it's just a square bar aren't you there's literally no looks like a rug that still is it still is pretty ya know how like you bring some ultra yapanese so this is just a milk chocolate bar that's all it is no chocolate it says a third of the bar is a hundred ninety calories so yes you're paying 250 for it but you have to think of it in serving sizes you're gonna get three servings potentially out of there it's not that it's not smooth well it was the milk it's smooth but it's not screaming but there's a difference it is smooth but there's there it's not creaming but I like that yeah nice up rough was the chocolate chips no I like this um I think it's a nice basic milk chocolate bar they could do a lot of Lego things with these they could add almonds tumor or anything ah it's decent this is the dark chocolate same calories Wow you can tell the dessert chocolate engine it's good though it's got a little bit of bitterness in that it's not really really bad right it doesn't completely dry your mouth out oh my god that's good very smooth I think it is - I think it's very nice this is the the white chocolate with raspberry they're off the Sun calories that's interesting cos door now so no matter which one you get in that dark chocolate it does leave a little bitterness in your mouth but I mean that's that's what you want from dark chocolate don't piece of see you get seeds that's my favorite one it's very good mm-hmm I love the to me the white chocolate is creamier than the others there is a creaminess to that ya can smooth it comes across this thicker for its not but it just the white chocolate in general comes across it seems thicker but it's not I really I like the raspberry the raspberry is not overpowering it's not like you're eating or as very preserves or something but it's just enough to where you can taste it and you do get lots and lots a little seat so if that's something that bothers you you might want to you you would want to know that but they're teeny teeny tiny you know they're very small they're not like a big home well that one I love that I think that one is absolutely delicious yeah I like the one I think that dark areas but I liked it too I like just the plain milk chocolate I know what probably feeling like I wasn't crazy about it but it's just it's just like the dark chocolate is just a dark traveling the milk chocolate is just some milk chocolate there's nothing wrong with it and you like about chocolate you're gonna like that no they're all good chocolate so these are definitely worthwhile mm-hmm I think some 10:15 for 250 I think

consume but how much do you really know about the rich and creamy source of goodness from solid chocolate to white chocolate here are some interesting tidbits you didn't know about the sweet treat number 17 hard work not many people realize the hard work and dedication that goes into making and supplying the public with chocolate the cacao tree bears pods that contain the cacao beans inside them and must be picked at the precise moment that they are ripe the beans must then go through a fermentation process and extensive drying period to get rid of excess moisture and produce the rich flavor profile the beans are then packaged and shipped off to manufacturers to be mass-produced in order to make just a single pound of chocolate roughly 400 cacao beans are needed and here in the US Americans eat 2.8 billion pounds each year number 16 film chocolate apparently chocolate isn't just for eating as it's also had its run in a couple different films working behind the scenes or at least under our noses this entire time in the 1960s slasher thriller film psycho chocolate syrup from the brand Bosco was used in order to mimic the appearance of blood during the now iconic shower scene this was because of how its consistency looked on camera in the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Willy Wonka's famous chocolate River was indeed made out of real chocolate the river contained a cream which made the whole thing rapidly spoil and the cast stated that the smell was quote ungodly number 15 obligation chocolate here in the Western society it is customary on Valentine's Day for people to buy their significant other a bouquet of roses and a box of assorted chocolates shaped like a heart more specifically male identifying persons give them to their female identifying partners very heteronormative way across the globe over in Japan however it is traditional for individuals that identify as female to give their male co-workers Beauty choco which means obligatory chocolate those who have boyfriends husbands and potential dates will go out and buy what are called hon may chuckle and that translates to true feeling chocolate in English number fourteen the limit exists there's the old adage that states too much of a good thing is not good and that definitely rings true for everything yes even the sweet goodness of chocolate though chocolate except white has antioxidants in it it turns out that eating too much chocolate in one sitting can have some undesired effects on your body first of all it can make you twitchy as reported in Wired magazine secondly the chemical theobromine in large doses is known to cause heart failure kidney damage seizures and can even be fatal this is the same chemical that makes chocolate so deadly for dogs number thirteen the cacao tree lifespan what's undoubtedly impressive is that the cacao tree is capable of living to be approximately 200 years old like with most things that sound too good to be true there is a catch that is that the cacao tree is only able to produce cacao beans for only 25 years of its long lifespan unfortunately the tree also has diseases and pests that it has to fight off such as fight o pathogens which are parasitic organisms that have managed to cause widespread damage to cacao trees all over the world not all foreign invaders are bad as a strain of bacteria streptomycin more onehans benefits the tree by preventing rotting and speeding up the seed germination process number 12 the three types universally there are three types of cacao beans that are known as for estado Rio low and trinitario the one that is most commonly used is the four estado variety that produces around 80 to 90 percent of the world's production of cacao Criollo the second kind is less commonly used due to the fact that it is a much rarer kind and is thought of as being a delicacy the Criollo variety doesn't yield as many crops as the forastero because that cacao bean is more susceptible to being destroyed by diseases the last type of cacao bean is the trinitario which happens to be a hybrid of both the forastero and Criollo number eleven special attribute do you ever wonder why chocolate begins to melt immediately as it sits on your tongue or when you've held it for not even the slightest moment that's due to the fact that chocolate has a very unique and interesting property to it the reason that it does so is because chocolate has a relatively low melting point between 86 degrees Fahrenheit this makes chocolate the only edible substance that has such a low melting point taking of temperatures chocolate should not go over a hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit or 43 degrees Celsius at the risk of getting lumpy or grainy chocolate number two solid chocolate chocolate can be traced back to almost four thousand years ago if you were to look back at the history of chocolate you see that firk dead majority it was consumed as a liquid that's estimated to be ninety percent of its history the sweet confection didn't achieve its solid state until the mid 19th century this was made possible thanks to a man named Joseph Frey in 1847 who figured out that chocolate can be made multiple by quote adding back melted cacao butter the Industrial Revolution also brought about new technologies to be used in the manufacturing of machine pressed chocolate and got the world one step closer to the chocolate we enjoy today number nine cacao currency way back when there was no such thing as paper money in the early ages of Mesoamerica both the Mayan and Aztec cultures used cacao beans as a form of currency this was because the cacao bean was seen as a rare commodity due to the fact that the cacao tree has a particularly low yield this led to the beans being used as a bartering form of currency rather than it having quote a standard of value for example just one rabbit was worth its weight in cacao that was said to be the equivalence of ten beans was the mines who first began this practice until they were taken over by the Aztecs and then they themselves were seized by the Spanish conquistadors led by anon Cortez number eight hot chocolate the sweet warmth of hot chocolate dates back thousands of years to when the Mayans would use the seeds of the cacao tree in order to concoct ceremonial drinks similarly the Aztecs would consume a brew known as choco Thal or bitter water it was slavered with chili pepper and vanilla in spanish conquistador Adnan Cortez brought cacao beans back to Spain approved popular amongst the Royals and friars helped spread chocolate throughout the land they visited monasteries and eventually hot chocolate made its way to France where it was also enjoyed today hot chocolate is now enjoyed all over the world number seven chocolate celebrations chocolate is deliciously sweet and deserves to be honored as such which is no surprise there are actual holidays out there that commemorate it there are at least 30 different holidays on the Gregorian calendar that observe the significance of chocolate there's at least one recognized day for chocolate each month some of these holidays include international chocolate Day on September 13th and even national bittersweet chocolate with almonds day which is on November 7th number 6 dark chocolate also referred to as plain chocolate and black chocolate dark chocolate is regarded as being the more healthier alternative out of all the other varieties of chocolate it's even been regarded as being quote a potential superfood due to the fact that it does contain antioxidants and has a pretty low sugar content than milk and white chocolate instead of being made with a milk based butter dark chocolate is instead made with cacao butter that must have a certain percentage of cacao solids in order to truly be considered dark chocolate number 5 milk chocolate this type of chocolate has been around since 1839 when it was first created by the German company Jordan and Timaeus though it was only available as a drink the first account of actual solid milk chocolate was recorded in 1875 when his Swiss confectioner by the name of Daniel Peter invented it with his neighbor Henry Nestle VIII Henry Nestle of Nestle the chocolate is made by mixing solid chocolate with drumroll please milk well milk that comes in the form of milk powder liquid milk or condensed milk it needs to be made with at least 10 percent cacao liqueur as stated by the US government number for white chocolate white chocolate was first introduced to the public sometime back in the 1930s and is often regarded as not being true chocolate at all due to it not having cacao solids or chocolate liqueur specifically in Europe white chocolate comes from ripe cacao beans that are fermented dried and then roasted the insides are then removed from their shells and those are what we refer to as cacao nibs the names are ground into a paste which is called chocolate liqueur which is then separated into both cacao butter and cacao solids by using a press the cacao butter is then used to create the white chocolate by adding other ingredients such as vanilla sugar and milk fat to make it taste better number great sweet vegetable all chocolate starts off in the form of the bean the cacao bean to be precise now the cacao bean grows from the branches of the cacao tree the cacao seeds are located inside of the fruit pods which are then harvested at the appropriate time and so begs the question is chocolate really a vegetable the thing is that the cacao tree is also classified in the same family as the vegetable okra and even cotton that family being of malvaceae number two the forth chocolate for the past 80 years give or take there have only been three official varieties of chocolate that are recognized those three varieties being dark chocolate milk chocolate and white chocolate however as of last year a Swiss chocolatier named Barry Callebaut has introduced what is being hailed as the fourth type of chocolate Ruby derived from the Ruby cacao bean Ruby chocolate gets its pink reddish hue naturally and has a flavor like no other it's been described as having quote a berry frutos and luscious smoothness number one chocolate origins the cacao bean itself can be traced all the way back to at least 1250 BC when it was being cultivated by the natives of Mexico Central and South America the incredibleness of chocolate is recorded to have been introduced to the region of Europe all the way back in 1550 all thanks to colonization it's been said that chocolate may have found its way to Europe even earlier in 1504 during Christopher Columbus's return from his final trip of exploiting the Americas natives and their land the chocolate originates from the Americas today 70% of the world's cacao supply is now grown in Africa so what's something you learned that you didn't already know let us know down

chocolate pretzel candy bar the ingredients are white and milk chocolate bark pretzels marshmallow fluff peanut butter chocolate chips crushed pecans and i think that's it oh and powdered sugar we're gonna start off by putting one jar of peanut butter in a bowl and mixing five tablespoons of powdered sugar with the peanut butter as you can see it's not an easy task [Music] now we're going to mix the peanut butter and powdered sugar together until it's well incorporated [Music] now that that's all done we're going to now melt our white chocolate and milk chocolate bark in two separate pans on medium low [Music] [Music] so [Music] now we're going to crush about a cup or so of pretzels so periodically we will check our chocolate to see how the melting is [Music] progressing [Music] now that our chocolate is finished melting we will now begin pouring it in the pan and you will alternate between white chocolate and milk chocolate [Music] now [Music] [Music] place the pan in the refrigerator for approximately 20 minutes or until the chocolate hardens once the chocolate has hardened we will then place our peanut butter mixture layer on top [Music] so [Music] after that's done we will now add our crushed pretzels [Music] now it's time to add our jet puffed marshmallow puff um it's probably not the best idea um that i put it on top of the loosely crushed pretzels but um this is just the way i decided to layer it and eventually it worked out so so if i can do it you can do it [Music] foreign [Music] so in the meantime i've already melted my second half of my milk chocolate and white chocolate and now we're going to pour that over our marshmallow puff and we're going to alternate between the [Music] two [Music] [Applause] [Music] from now it's time to add your crushed pecans and whatever other toppings you'd like to put on there so now your giant chocolate bar is finished don't forget to put it back in the refrigerator for a few minutes to let the chocolate harden

basically it's one of those you know green and blacks um lint and Cadbury a few of our companies you know basically they just do sort of like a sort of slabs of chocolate basically and it's becoming more more and more common really to see them in supermarkets or things and yeah and then do a Lindo range I only do a regular Linn range as well so I guess Linda is a bit like their equivalent of Pat's Cadbury's Dairy Milk maybe and I'm not too sure specific I thought it was just I thought they were originally the spheres you know the speeds of chocolate what's the more famous for I would imagine and yeah because that's what's usually is referred to by Linda bottom seems not to be the case so perhaps it's just their type or a recipe of chocolate or a range of chocolate or something and so do our description on the on the back here well maybe this is maybe this is it it says some white chocolate with a smooth melting filling so maybe just the fact it's not melting filling now they realized this side so I didn't realize it had a melting filling and I guess the clues here but I thought that was just an effect split Sam yeah so maybe it is that's a natural range with the melting feeling so it doesn't have to be a sphere at all maybe so that's quite exciting and yeah XII was expecting this just to be a block of white chocolate but maybe it's something a bit more interesting hmm yeah so it's a basically got term I believe name is German forest in the language but it has the English underneath it as well and it reads to be smooth yes and you could determine equivalent well when n delete the suction L send I think it is I think I apologize told you I was watching it and we don't very nice feet so per term we could actually let the linda scheffe this time get away of it because he's wearing white and no speck of chocolate Olli what part we just can't see it because it's white chocolate well the IRA so that he is dealing in milk chocolate so I won't yeah he's never touched opera in his life and so he much says so ever blah blah blah so Lindo your moments of bliss created by the lint master chocolatier passion and love for chocolate since 1845 snow again yeah so says Wyatt swiss chocolates when a smooth Marting filling so we're carry stuff hundred grams done the whole bar is hundred grams that's quite good so it gives us so we know exactly where we are so 647 calories yeah 51 grams of fat 39 of which is saturates that's for the whole bar so half of it it's still quite high talking roughly 425 calories and 320 for calories and yeah 25 and a half grams of fats roughly about 19 at which is such as roughly 90 and a half so when yes if half the bar is still you know what I said now for calories yeah but so 420 now about 400 and was I say 19 yeah furniture 25 20 24 324 calories yes I still quite an ya high but you know there we go it was my cousins I wonder might try and even ones in the range turn really give her ones of these Lindo rage right I think I only saw this one or I just stood out for some reason I don't know why maybe he said it was new there's no new on the packets packaging here but maybe said he was new in the supermarket my sure yeah that's very nice it's got the typical Lindo effect here all these weird leave things much more there whatever they I'm not sure what it meant to be someone might know but um yeah that's on all the middle Spears that they do yeah then sustainability live.com look at that some what kind of Fairtrade finger mansion or something associated with it there we go okay so I say let's give me an open show week peppercorn s Collins open effect on the side I don't know you know why it's got two indents in there but erm hey just to show you opens now how many sets of clothes they touch like yes so I'm trying to wear open it in the way they want me to I'm not sure so there's like this tab underneath here there's almost coming off there so I don't know what that's about I don't know and yeah I'm not sure how he meant sorry cos I don't know maybe Iseman sofa come off not meant have come off and not be stuck there I don't know anyway yes I feel like it's not it's not warm today but I feel like it's warm so this will be nothing too much they've got a nice boil here these sort of wrapping paper files where you know you can hear it can you all right that's it might be cheaper to make I don't know submit this file but I prefer it than this wrapping paper for you sometimes go and you can also do the old indent thing as well which I like really would be in normal times I never would be normally fashion knowledge I would have open to find out basically yeah but you know it's quite nice to do mmm just do a keycaps a lot when I was young you know of course you can rub the middle of one of the blocks be careful and don't tear it so you can get to get to say late there we go so if you won't look at the time you can do it follow them so you can see it Sam there's basically a two by six block so basically six blocks would be half of your things wouldn't it so yeah so I'm not going to attempt to divide it into where sticks and things like this but took a long story short and it's just under hundred calories for two blocks so yeah so bear that in mind when you have it because obviously the whole thing it's 647 calories and yeah is that right yeah I think that's right maybe maybe I'm wrong um yeah no I'm right yeah so yeah yeah so it's quite so yeah wonder if it's more than actually sick because I use a safe isn't it so it's over 100 cows didn't yeah so is yeah so I say I get bogged down in the maths again I you know I always let myself down it should be really straightforward to but I just you know anyway yeah so basically the whole thing is sitting 247 calories so sick from it which is two blocks clearly must be a hundred K wasn't it so hundred and hundred five or something like that maybe a hundred and oh just under a hundred and ten anyway yeah so move on June 8 and yeah 180 calories probably for just two blocks so if you bear that in mind that is quite high yeah nice quite okay right so am just GU popper open so see all sorts of the science was actually quite hard to really get in without just destroying the whole foil which kind of you know just go against I'll reseal ability aspects of it so you know yeah you should snap it inside the foil maybe of course for this review on to hold off so there we go here we go looks quite nice nice white chocolate that you'd say mmm smells very nice really two small notes actually from user your carts might from you know you have to be like about a centimeter wait this might but it smells it does smell very nice it looks nice as well you can see the lint right in there scream is so no come on the back so no tire tracks or anything from there available to his mother I'm a jerk weeks it's melting a bit in my hands just typical creamy chocolate it's about 15 cents I made 15 1/2 centimeters long at the bottom and with wise 7.4 just under said without so much fun obviously at the top would be slightly less much straighter decides about 15 point 4 for long does not change that much a way for you to move what's up 7.3 yes and height-wise ideas in a second yes 550 wait six hi actually avoiding must've height-wise 0.8 okay so it's really exciting outside right okay so when yeah let's give myself a lift up I think when we get tasting it why not so I have all Hello so I'm gonna stop it in half yes it's very yeah there's no so melty and it's just not snapping at all but us because I'll tell you what let's before I do tasty let's just cut it in half so you can see the soybean side now we're very hard to see because obviously white chocolate apparently it's fluffy on the inside I can't really see that can you and don't think can't tell I mean see yourself a different texture you seems to be that smooth Lindor filling well cuz it closely you know so you can tell it's smoother than the outside but it's very hard to tell then because I'm looking for it okay that's let's give it a taste then why not mmm-hmm it really does him there's no way they'll endure spheres where there's a sort of a crunch to the outside it really is very very thin the top layer chocolate yeah hmm can't tell at all really but it's very thin talking this sort of a millimeter maybe maybe two of the size but yeah hmm I'm gonna get to get that really softly Lindor melt-in-your-mouth chocolately having this fears cousin it's very nice actually he's already that's really nice to me so it's quite sickly after two we're two sections don't have to say much I think it's quite sickly anyway okay mine is that sense which is soft and they're very M very very creamy you know it's you know so you if you've had Island or sphere before you'll notice Betty it's like that and like while either side surfing normally they'll indoors bit too sickly because there's too much of them if this of the sort of the creamy sentence in one place for me it's a bit too sickly even the milk chocolate one never mind that the white one which I find even more sickly to me white chocolate just generally no but this one no very nice yeah it's a because it just has a bit of less of a this less of this Center even though ratio-wise is actually more of it because there's less of the outside but in one section you know you can have then you can enjoy it and doesn't get too sickly too quickly and I really like it yeah I think it's a bit more balanced because last time and what previously those mini Lindo balls which is sort of like a very you know the main ones are so about that big for the EM the mini ones about me know very fat a lot small but they were actually preferred those because of the amount of sense it was a bit less what's a lot that's obviously what um you know just for per mouthful it was just easy to eat and wasn't as sickly and these ones have been a lot more along those lines as well really hmm you know it's just you know it's not having as much at once in that centre but you know proportionally there's a lot less of this or surrounding chocolate and so means around the bus maybe yeah the parts would prefer a bit more of a man what's around you know a bit like the Lind or spheres but I guess they would just be making you know why not just have them in those spheres in that case so yeah I think um I think I like this I think he's you know very sickly then that'd be the thing that would you know you know be a bit bad but I think I'm you know obviously white chocolate as will love this and as many of you out there as I know and yes you know you are there's a few of you white chocolate ya know like op in UK we don't have much white chocolate going on in UK now really and from UK well typical my producers by Cadbury and things just don't seem to touch why talk anymore and you don't get many of every day so we're just you know so relying on certain laws of European companies to bring to bring them over here and then yeah and hmm and this one such case really yeah let's play nice could be interested Tralee ones as well or of that Lindelof slap chocolates and bars like this I'll be doing issues trying so yeah I think em before me myself um mistakes them it is really really nice but it's very they stick the I think I'm hitting the limit now how much me to this before I have to stop you know let me talk I just go all the way through me ask you mr. Fire book hmm just too sickly now really him so I think I mean probably a four out of five it's really really nice really difference not just their Mustapha chocolate yeah you know very creamy gives you that Lindor kick as well he really do get that feel of Lindor there and it's nice it's have a different way of eating it and it's not just the rebounding of the sphere is such because there's less chocolate in this one it was in less of the surrounds you don't get that crunches you snap it'll bite into it mm-hmm so yeah these were if he does have a place and yeah I think figure four out of five for me because it's just too it too sickly mmm you know and that's always been my problem with wind or really and with Lynn doors but it's yeah it's one of those because it's they are very very nice so far outs if I mean you know if you have five ages other things fortified they're probably not as good as this but um let's say I think him but then it's difficult one is I'm not you know Belgian chocolate Swiss chocolate he's always he's very creamy anyway and that Yuki me for me normally and it needs quite sickly book so you know if you love Belgian chocolate and swiss chocolates and I think obviously muslin doors then this is a five out of five for you definitely I think a four out of five million but it's a it's a high four out of five really or not four and a half book and IV just felt just a bit too sickly stops it but it does stop eating too much of it because it's very high in calories so so there is that again I saw each other review where four meters of subscribe our videos probably scam as well and I'll seen this time take everyone see you later bye for now see ya", "iSHksQOPWmg": "I am when I welcome you to the series of chocolate so when I was a child my mother used to actually make chocolate at home because cooking chocolate slabs were not available at all then and whatever small roles that she had she was held in that and we would just Kulp it down they were so tasty so that recipe I'm going to share with you today and you can actually make a nice good slab of chocolate awk and you can take all the credit so how do you make this slab of chocolate we want to make milk chocolate and to make milk chocolate what I have here is I have set up a double boiler so there is your span in which there is water and the water is not touching the bowl the bowl has just been placed over the fan where there is water and the bowl and there is a gap in between and that's how it is what I have here is cocoa butter so the cocoa butter is in the bowl and we have to melt your cocoa butter so here is the butter factor of the entire slab and in terms of milk solids you're going to be adding in some milk powder and you're going to be adding in powdered sugar to get the sweetness but if you get cocoa butter nothing like it so you go the butter is almost melted what we like to this is milk powder add milk powder and stir so after adding milk powder let's add powdered sugar after adding powdered sugar you need to stir it once again and you can actually now switch off the heat the water in the pan below is quite hot it's in fact boiling so that is take care of the heat that is needed to get this mixture done and we add in cocoa powder again this cocoa powder is unsweetened if you have sweet and cocoa powder at home then in that case the quantity of powdered sugar should be less okay this is done and you just have to mix it up like this alternately you can use a whisk after the entire mixture looks smooth like this like I told you to mix it up well you not have a single lump in there in the mold now have managed to get mold which looks exactly like a nice good slab of chocolate so I'm just going to take this what I have is enough for those three chocolate flaps and a little bit that is remaining if I put it in this we have a very fine or a very thin slab of chocolate I'll still show it to you all you have to do is pick it up and put in the switch this will take at least half an hour to set you will have the chocolate loosened from the base once it sets completely just remove it the regular pieces and enjoy homemade milk chocolate so the milk chocolate was lying in the fridge and it is done is set how do you know if it's set the minute you turn it it just comes off oh wow look at the glaze isn't it look like a slab of chocolate bought from the market what I will do is I am broken this into pieces like this I'm gonna actually pick it up and eat it over it's just Melton mouth and I face much better nobody Bible market next time I'm going to add some mint a sense to this and I'll have the lovely mint chocolate and I think after that I can also add some orange a sense and you can have some lovely orange flavored chocolates choice of your recipe is yours just go ahead and explore and enjoy your favorite milk chocolate [Music]", "XlbVq2J0TO4": "[Music] before i start this video make sure you guys subscribe to the channel hit

yeah it's a very s it's very soft nougat's more chewy you're right that's more candy barish like super soft and like this is this reminds me with my chocolate though of the milky way but all in caramel so because they have milky ways so caramel and the nougat that's really good and then they have the milky way all caramel and this is like exactly it except in white chocolate form i'm borderline buy a box of these and try to smash a whole box on camera or something that might be the challenge i do i don't know this is beautiful do you want to rate it afterwards okay we're gonna do the next one um cookies and cream that one was beautiful not super caramel tasting either i feel like it's very well balanced between the white chocolate and the caramel it's not like super sweet yeah oh my god look at that oh my god look at that oh baby oh and get small piece you know makes sense what is this i just this is a candy bar that's what she said it's not super cookies and cream but it's like a white chocolate mixed with like a chocolate a regular chocolate right hmm that's so easy to eat um right yeah it's more chocolatey it's not really like an oreo that's really good that white chocolate what is it or it's really good i'd put it up with the other one i honestly think it's preference at that point russia's preference i'm not a fan of this flavor i feel like it's very consistent though like consistent yeah it's like the same exact but like my caramel juice that's a winner to me this this one's really good consistent but it's you know it's more of a chocolate taste it's not really like i don't get a cookies and cream taste yeah that's what i'm saying now this one can be interesting candy cane hit or miss you know i mean isn't candy cane just oh my god it seems very festive oh my god it's a little melted i think i don't know how i think it was supposed to be more festive looking peppermint and stuff still looks pretty festive than me yeah i agree let's put the looks inside oh baby yeah look at that here we go cheers guys they're all candy bars and this one though has more like a dark chocolate taste this is a dark chocolate feel with like a peppermint peppermint background it almost reminds me of are your peppermint patty that's what i was your peppermint patties are dark chocolate yeah very reminiscent of a york peppermint patty it's not super dark it's just right and the mint is not crazy menzies i like it i can smash that easily no problems hmm that's okay the dark child is just throwing me off because we had the caramel and cookies and cream beforehand i think if i was like it's it's a preference thing like if you're a peppermint fan i think you're really gonna like this one usually like i like your patties i like peppermint i love candy canes but i think like i just wasn't ready after eating all those sweets i think i would have liked a lot more are you gonna read them all the same or differently um you're going to write them differently we'll do that i mean i'm going to rate this other two the same i'm going to rate the peppermint just a little bit different i don't know because they've kept the consistency the same it's true they are very consistent and i think honestly it's it's a taste preference because i think they stand by what they're named but like i'm not a cookies and cream fan and i'm a huge i i like um minty things but i just wasn't in the mood for minty things i think the white chocolate caramel is i don't i feel like they're all the same but i do like the white chocolate caramel and better there was something with that one there was something with that i think it was the white chocolate mix so how do i do the ratings i think i think the cookies and cream and peppermint have the same rating but different from the caramel one i agree with that i'll do that okay all right so let's do let's do let's do the peppermint and the cookies and cream white chocolate cookies and cream and peppermint ready three two one nine point seven five okay it was like right there consistency like it's all good it's just the taste i'm like it's good bottom line it's okay the cookies and cream isn't anything like you know like i agree i don't i don't know what that word i'm looking for it's just it's not like a walmy flavor you know it's your typical standard flavor and the peppermint one is the white chocolate caramel let me read that one yes three two one it was so that was like one of the best things i've eaten in a while literally doesn't even taste like protein you just keep two tens though holy we just don't know we just did a review the before listen it doesn't happen if it happens buy it pretty much um so basically um yeah i mean i said 9.5 and i said 10 for the other flavor so these are like high nines for me and she said 10 and then 8.75 so you're looking at a 9 average between all three flavors and if you guys have seen our previous reviews i think we said like all nines and like even trevor was like yeah for all the flavors there were some flavors that were weird a little bit weaker but nothing bad like it was totally still an eight to nine category so i think you guys want to try this out go get the mixed box you get a mixed box of 18 bars for 30 something dollars and i'm pretty sure there's a coupon code possibly out there too to get them even cheaper so i don't have a coupon code but um if you guys try them out let me know what the you think um these are pretty popular bars so definitely let me know what you guys think of these flavors if you guys have tried them thanks adam once again for sending them over and other than that make sure you guys follow us on all our social media description box below give it a thumbs up doesn't cost you guys a penny and other than that we'll check you guys later", "LzH4YuvPJ44": "homemade candies are super special but they often require really fancy equipment to make them I have a tip to teach you how to make them without any special equipment so I've started by taking some white chocolate chips and I've just melted them at full power in the microwave in 20 second intervals you want it kind of like this consistency go ahead and scrape all the white chocolate onto your parchment oh my gosh I kind of want to drink this Oh make sure you get it all and now I'm using an offset spatula you can also use the table knife and you're just gonna spread it into a quarter inch thick layer nice and easy there we go and now the best part the best part is you get to customize your candies so because I love rainbow sprinkles I'm gonna decorate them with that the higher you go the more even it is it's okay if you spill some cuz then you could just eat them now you want to go ahead and let the sheet of white chocolate set in a cool part of the kitchen until it sets completely the trick to turning this sheet of white chocolate into individual candies our cookie cutters you just use the cutter to punch out the chocolate I can't wait any longer I think I deserve a little treat so I'm gonna go ahead and eat one of my little mad genius white chocolate candies delicious it's creamy mad jeans you",

Knoxville Chocolate Company in Knoxville Tennessee these were sent to us from Kristi thank you very much Kristi this is just it looks like a white chocolate bar it actually does not have any leg belong at the other two have labels which I have taken pictures of and you'll see at the end this one you'll just see the front it's a thank you on it it's like stamped in the white chocolate it just doesn't have anything on it this one says it is a milk chocolate pecan bar I'm really looking for about now enough topic covered sandwich cookie which it says Oreos yeah yeah sure no chocolate over for you okay so we don't know any calories or anything for the know we think we're guessing that this is just a local unit or something yeah but you can go online you can go online and their website is Knox chalks calm its KN o x CH o X calm you think white chocolate no no kind of good a little bit of bitter aftertaste up he does it's not to me I did not care about no it's got what's it to the bitter expertise which doesn't fixture it's not from forming from the very from the get-go it does not taste like white chocolate it's not sweet no I like those candies even almond bark sweeter than that though yeah almond barks very sweet I don't know what that one is it's like they just did to make the thank you right to just say thank you maybe they don't expect people to actually he did not add hours I go I didn't like it here for that one this is the milk chocolate pecan bar gums all over did you get you may be sue or no I'm working on woman it's very very thick a lot of pecans really good so I don't know what that white ones about it doesn't say it's white chocolate but it might be those noble white these no one else is but I can wear them I would they need to take that we're gonna think about that because if people you know like if Christy had just stuck to thank you in there we would have tried that in thought room I don't know about this company becomes darker gonna capsize right by because she put some other things in there all right you're right so I just think they need to rethink whatever they're using for that because you wouldn't want that to paint your whole company back more and I would do this milk chocolate hallmark is so much very good oh yeah the cod really comes first like this one this is the house look chocolate-covered Oreos answers easier to bite this one how can anybody not love Oreo that's been dipped in chocolate well the chocolate helps counteract some of that bitterness from the dark of the cookie oh I like it much better with chocolate than I do just a plain ol Oreo cookie I agree mmm and when Nabisco actually comes out in the winter come with the white footage dipped oh my gosh there why not they're so so so good love them this is delicious my favorite thing though is that milk chocolate the palm bark I mean that is well done um I would definitely check out their company don't let the one just I don't know about this I wouldn't I would not get that again I would I would not order that but anything that has milk chocolate with something I would wouldn't hesitate to order it because I think that milk chocolate is excellent and it's the same the same milk chocolate they use for the pecan bark was the same milk chocolate they used for the Oreo cookie so thank you so much to Christy for synonyms to us giving us the opportunity to try something new and thanks for watching [Music]", "Owvyq93M00Y": "[Music] while the recent threat of a major chocolate shortage in the coming years seems to have been narrowly averted for now it turns out that those who were in despair need not have fretted as substitutes are available to get you through the rough times including one that is actually relatively healthy black sapote which just happens to taste a bit like chocolate pudding native to the coastal regions in and around Central America black sapote is a fruit related to the persimmon and it is today cultivated primarily across the Caribbean as well as in Mexico Australia and the Philippines on the tree the fruit sort of resembles a green tomato when ready for picking and it's extremely important that you don't try to pick it too early or eat it right off the tree unripe black sapote is not only don't taste like chocolate birds are actually quite gag-worthy further if it's picked too early the fruit won't ever ripen and will simply rot which one imagines doesn't improve the flavor though Worcestershire sauce does exist and that essentially uses fish whose bodies of well let's just say matured over a rather long period to the point that they liquefy making a gooey base at the popular sauce so we guess someone thought you try rotted sapote at some point just to find out in any events picked at the right time the black sapote will ripen within about three to six days after harvest when this happens the formerly white pulp turns a deep brown and develops a distinctive taste that together with this papaya like texture of course many to compare it to chocolate pudding hence the nickname chocolate pudding fruit the pulp can be eaten as is but given that it tastes sort like chocolate pudding it's also commonly used in various recipes as a substitute for chocolates so moving on from this have you ever wondered if white chocolates is actually chocolates well ones no more or sort of you see it kind of depends on who you ask ands language being language if enough people call something a thing it kind of is a thing by definition of the words I mean it's literally named white chocolate but that's not very interesting so let's dive a little deeper shall we in order for a chocolate item to be deemed chocolate it is generally made with the constituents of chocolate liqueur cocoa butter and cocoa solids depending on the proportions of various ingredients along with the - there are several types of chocolates like dark chocolate milk chocolate semi-sweet chocolate etc white chocolates is not usually included on this list as it's made of our getting rid of the cocoa solids altogether which are the primary flavorful cocoa ingredients in any type of so-called real chocolate it's one and only real potential claims that the chocolate throne is that in many places it does contain cocoa butter which is a type of yellowish white vegetable fat but other vegetable oils are often substituted as well however in many places regulations keep a decent amounts of the cocoa butter in if a company wants to be able to call it white chocolate for example since 2004 in the United States in order for a product to be called white chocolate it has to contain at least 20% cocoa butter along other standard ingredients the Food and Drug Administration has also stipulated white chocolate should contain at least 14 percent total milk solids three point five percent milk fat and no more than 55 percent sugar or other sweeteners finally there are also lecithin and flavorings most often vanilla in the white chocolates as cocoa butter itself isn't very pleasant tasting and thus isn't typically used as a standalone flavor unless you don't want people to eat your product for reference the American Standard was later adopted by the European Union except the limit on sugar or sweeteners but in the end despite the relatively new firm requirement of cocoa butter in America and the European Union most still don't consider white chocolate a true chocolate given its complete lack of cocoa solids making white chocolate that of a bastard child technically still an offspring of the cocoa bean but chocolate connoisseurs don't seem to want to acknowledge its claim to the throne and have some bonus fact if you ever wondered what the M stand for in one of the world's favorite chocolate based candies M&Ms are one - no more in 1941 Forrest Mars senior of the Mars candy company struck a deal with Bruce Murrie son of famed Hershey's president William Murray to develop a hard shell candy with trotters at the center Mars needed Hershey's chocolate because he anticipated there would be a chocolate shortage in the pending war which turned out to be correct as such the deal gave Mari a 20% stake in the newly developed M&M this stake was later bought out by Mars when chocolate rationing ended at the end of the war in 1948 the name the stood for Mars and Marie the co-creators of the candy speaking of fruits and colorful things the color orange was named after the fruit not the other way around before then the english-speaking world referred to the orange color as gula read which literally translates to yellow red the word orange itself was introduced to English through the Spanish word Neriah which comes from the Sanskrit word Nyonya which itself means orange tree the English dropped the leading N and eventually we got the word orange in the early 16th century the word orange gradually started being used not only to refer to the fruit but also what we now know of as the color orange and now for another bonus fact in high school major-league baseball star Justin Verlander traded a small percentage of his eventual 3.12 million signing bonus for a 50 cent chocolate milk this happened while he was in the tenth grade at Goochland high school in Virginia Shore 50 cents he needed for a chocolate milk that day he asked his friend Daniel Hicks for the money so I said how about I give you 0.01 percent actually it was 0.001 percent of my pro signing bonus if he give me 50 Cent's now he found a napkin wrote it up and I signed it I forgot about it but after I signed with Detroit he comes over and whips out this old napkin I'm like oh my god my bonus was 3 point something million in truth of the industrious Daniel Hicks had managed to turn 50 cents into three thousand one hundred and twenty dollars in just about five years when Verlander signed with Detroit in 2004 out of college for a guaranteed contract of 4.5 million dollars maximum five point six million dollars with a signing bonus of 3.1 million since then besides marrying supermodel Kate Upton Verlander has made about two hundred and thirty million dollars to date with another 66 million dollar contract to still be paid out and probably still going strong after so we guess he's not missing the three thousand dollars and Hicks should have held out for a smaller percentage of Verlander's lifetime earnings so I really hope you found that video interesting if you did please do hit that thumbs up button below and don't forget to subscribe also why not

here's the kitchen conundrum that I know you've all been asking about what to do with seeds chocolate when all you really want is this perfectly melted silky smooth satiny chocolate like this well I'm going to show you how you get from point A chokolate to point B which is perfect and if it does happen to seize on you how to fix this lumpy mess so starting off I have about 8 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate here Penn I'm gonna go over a pot of simmering water so a heat proof glass bowl works well you don't want a vigorous boil you just want a simmer because chocolate is so sensitive to heat you really don't want the chocolate to come over 110 to 120 degrees you want to avoid introducing moisture into the chocolate because that's what makes chocolate seiza so make sure all of your utensils that you're using are free of moisture and try to avoid wooden spoons which can kind of Harbor moisture so clean dry utensils and gently stir the chocolate every so often until it's nice and smooth and melted after a few minutes an occasional stirring the chocolate is nicely melted it's shiny it's beautiful silky ready for whatever you need it for now be careful here you want to remove it from the heat and you also want to wipe the underside of the bowl because that has a ton of moisture you want to make sure that it doesn't get into your chocolate so remember to wipe the bottom of the bowl and whenever you're melting chocolate make sure you never cover it that actually will create condensation drip back down into the chocolate and make it seiz so try to avoid those things but if you do end up with seized chocolate like this there's a very easy way to fix it the fastest and easiest way is to add a little bit more water boiling water now this might seem a little crazy since that's what got you into this mess the excess moisture but it really does help to fix the problem now if you were coating strawberries here or if you were make some sort of candy or bark you wouldn't really be able to use this chocolate for it but this is just a way to avoid throwing away the chocolate so a teaspoon at a time of boiling water into the chocolate and you just need to stir this around until it becomes nice and thin and silky you might have to add a few more teaspoons of water at a time just a teaspoon at a time until it's a nice silky texture and as you can see the chocolate is shiny silky viscous and it's perfect right now for adding into a brownie batter into a cake batter or simply on top of some ice cream and your once seized chocolate that you were going to throw away is now usable so there you go kitchen conundrum solved if you have any kitchen conundrums that you need solved whether they're baking whether they're holiday related breakfast related write in the comments

about milk chocolate what is milk chocolate milk chocolate is solid chocolate with added milk and most of the time its milk powder not fresh milk milk powder doesn't contain any water or moisture and that's a huge benefit that compared to fresh milk so you can just simply add it to your chocolate and you're good to go it's a little bit different if you really want to use familiar because fresh milk is an emulsion which means it's a water base with fat drops in there and those fat drops are homogenized in in the water base which means the main base is water and our chocolate is fat based and you know what happened if you want to make a salad dressing the oil rises up and due to the density the what is below so it's not homogenized and same would happen with chocolate and chocolate would even see maybe you've had that before when you have melted some chocolate and you got a drip of water in there and it's a total mess and you can't use it anymore that's why we use milk powder and not milk you have to regulate milk chocolate has the following milk chocolate should contain 35% of fat that's to cacao butter 20% of Merak solids that would be our milk powder 40% of sugar and 30% of cat-cow it's different in different countries but that's just a regulation of the FDA here in the US now a little bit to the history an 1875 ten-year Peter he was a Swiss chocolatier I'm invented a very first milk chocolate bar but he got a little bit of help his neighbor was Henry Nestle and yes that's the Nestle guy and Nestle invented at the milk powder before so Daniel Peter edits a milk powder in his chocolate and the first milk chocolate bar was born but another thing happened four years later 1879 at Rudolph Lind invented a counting machine which is a huge improvement in the texture of milk chocolate and I think that's the point where European style chocolate separated from american-style chocolate so european-style chocolate is known for its richness and smooth eNOS and creaminess and american-style chocolate it's more gritty and even a little bit sandy so that's like huge differences and I grew up with european-style chocolate so that's something so familiar and normal to me um I grew up with milk cow which is um like I think a classic milk chocolate bar very creamy very rich very milky and sweet and I think a difference make definitely the contouring process due to the craft chocolate makers we have a totally new category that's the dark milk and I would say the dark milk chocolate made milk chocolate cool again there's no formal definition for it so there's no FDA regulations or anything and it's under the category sweet chocolate which means it contains up to 12% of milk solids and the cacao content is 50% and labeouf dark milk parts usually have higher cacao percentages compared to milk chocolate bars but it's creamier and smoother and richer but it still has the broad flavor spectrum of dark chocolate bar companies like fruition um no more whole goth are creating really great dark bug bars so you should totally check them out if you're interested in that currently I'm also working on a vegan milk chocolate buy but I'm using coconut

the hazelnut milk chocolate and it says that children children under three shouldn't have these only because they worry about the the ribbon but the ribbon easily comes off you just put it over the bunny's head so I mean you could take that off and and and I want you all to know that I always have pictures at the end of the nutrition facts and the ingredients there are no calories on these at all and as far as the ingredients there was really it's all in the side of the money so the way that this is shape it's just hard to take a picture look it up and write upside that will open but I'm gonna tear it anyway I'm sure but there won't be any information at the end there will be a picture but there won't be any information so this is the white bunny kind of stands I think this 1/4 oh it's a doesn't matter really I'm not gonna even worry about it so we're going to pause right here so that I can get a picture of these and we'll be right back I did take a picture of the hazelnut

sometimes white chocolate is kind of harsh on your throat they kind of leave just pinned on with white chocolate no tincture for a little bit that doesn't do that to me it's a very very smooth yes it's very good but I tell you what I wish it did have calories because if someone if I got that in my Easter basket I would eat the whole play yeah over a block over a day today one sitting I could eat that one sitting no problem are you kidding me yes I can't really today that I now would not be said of course I usually get sugar the kidney no I never got sick eating chocolate hmm that's a good note part what's wrong mm-hmm so bad all smooth but yeah if you are judging your wife yeah you're a milk-chocolate about her she's you know you need to move on from that because this they're miles apart miles and lots of flavors you yes completely different experience in the quality of chocolate you really need to try a Lindt chocolate and they sell the Lindt chocolate the chocolate bars in Walmart so you can get them and they're like they're meant to be for like three servings so you are paying a little bit more but put in your mind how much would three Hershey Park scoffs you know so

hazelnuts held together with chocolate yeah I'll make another picture I took one of them hold it I'll make another picture that's almost like a bombers illustration let me know I'll love white chocolate white chocolate is my favorite favorite chocolate but out of these three rabbits that hazelnut is it's so wonderful and they're their thick piece of chocolate oh I through I mean the whole bunny is pretty thick and know that the hazelnuts are just there's so many a long look I mean it's like hey some ground hazelnuts he'll be under the chalk yeah but it's definitely really cool so that is the better what do you think yeah if you like having a bother isn't that one's no no you don't even think about it yes yes definitely thank you I'm trying to get this I'm on that for some reason that one's good but there's better I've had better okay but I mean we've had a lot of milk yeah but I like them a lot you know like what I like but the Haven one if you like hey tonight get down yes so I hope you all enjoyed the video Mona thank you so much very very much for some things we really appreciate it and thanks for watching [Music]", "cSM5areIviM": "hey guys me actually got to try these two Cadbury candy bars they're the Dairy Milk candy bars one of them is just milk chocolate velvety smooth you can work hours and this one is caramel Oh with milk chocolate and creamy caramel you in the milk chocolate you get seven blocks for 200 calories and there are two point five servings in here so there are 14 18 ish blocks for 200 calories so it's 400 400 and 500 this whole thing is 500 calories I think and this one is six blocks 170 calories and there's three servings so it's it's and these were recommended by Jacques Vanessa and I forgot to tell you all that so you can thank her for recommending those nope so as you can see the milk chocolate are completely flat and all the caramel inside is a little pocket a caramel we make sound effects for everything here in the dinosaur it's milky that's not it's good I think it's money it's thick it's like a Cadbury Creme Egg it's that chocolate except you're getting more of it it is but this is chocolate always had more moments I don't want to say bitter but it's an off taste for me it's not as sweet as our she's born so what that is I would rather have a Hershey bar for 75 cents versus two oh well this is a big one too this is a great big bar I don't think they sell regular-sized Cadbury bars here in the United States these are very popular in like England Cadbury is England must not a Hershey's they don't have a lot of shoe don't they don't like horses are people I've heard that eat them don't like them because they think it's you sweetie so but we like we're used to this way so okay this is the oh it's leaking that's a promising sign no it's no it's good yeah he doesn't like I could join see it's gonna be runny like war have you ever had a caramel Omar candy bar there's this little caramel bar is just like a caramel it's just a bigger version of them that's delicious the caramel is good that's guys that funky chocolate my god that was that that is delicious no you can have it how things that I will let you actually you don't think it's delicious no a Rolo has firm caramel I like that runny caramel I like running caramel too but not not they you left the piece yeah I just don't like it I'd rather not waste my calories on that wall yeah I personally don't like I know it's very popular candy bar everywhere but for me I would rather like I said that just drive a roll of Rolo ice-covered caramel can't sweet chocolate yo I like that so anyway thanks for watching", "XateeqqrXNY": "today Kevin and I have two new to us these are Nestle Swift's chocolates I have the chocolate brunt I don't know what that means chocolate brought to you oh okay the the in this one there is a this is assorted chocolates there are five different candy bars in this box right mono has one it's 13 mini pralines milk chocolate and that looks like hazelnut and how much was yours very expensive 498 at Walmart but you get you get 13 little pieces okay mine was seven dollars and 58 cents but these are out for what they were in the Valentine stuff but I don't know why they don't say Valentine's they don't indicate they don't indicate Valentine's at all but they were in like the seasonal Valentine stuff and I didn't see them the whole time at Christmas so I mean but okay there are 48 many candy bars in here and I'll just I'll talk about mommy would get to know what is yours mine are mini pray rings mmm and Emma calories cuz I know has four bars of sensitivity I'm thinking these are from imported in Switzerland and that's what they would be yeah that's why they're bright so expensive as soon they are from Switzerland their meanings are yes 13 minutes little eighties like the size of my pinky finger it's the same size they're good okay hazelnut flavor it's like a soft creamy chocolate all the way through mm-hmm totally the little I guess those are nuts or something on the outside which they were a little crisper mm-hmm because there's no crisper to it you would hope there's a little crispy coating all right they um this is the type of chocolate that you would expect to find in a chocolate box because it's so smooth it's very crazy when you see the picture on the front and you would expect it to have some texture some crunch to it like Kevin's them and there's absolutely no not just to smooth it's nice it's not milk um or Cadbury no but it's nice yeah good luck daughter okay it's not as nice as mocha or Patrick but it's still nice job okay this box there's milk chocolate dark chocolate hazelnut praline and white so open it out and it comes like this and you're gonna be making which was like half of all you could get eight pieces yeah what do you have you can get eight pieces and sit on the couch and make that last for a while and look that's basically the same calories is in a whole candy bar tell you the right thing you need a red one which is milk and you need a gentle wife what one brother yeah there's one red one in the whole entire bag okay that's not very nice that's the only one that's a milk chocolate yeah there's tons of the yellow ones or the yellow ones on the yellow ones wife which I like why we will see if I like this white which one do you want to offer to get some prisons Green via green you can't buy your own yeah we'll just okay these are the ones you want to just try the milk yeah this is the only red one in here it's the only ones alone no yeah you better hold this one up and it looks like just a little piece of candy bar it's a little literally like know what you show there no no let's show hmm it just picked okay go ahead and watch better talk long yeah I have to it's just playing to me it's just um I don't know it's very smooth and creamy but it's not very flavorful yeah it's not a rich chocolatey you know let's go ahead for that was a bitter flavor to it offices note does let's go from milk to dark and we'll see if is this better you know what that has a ton more flavor at least you know you're eating something with that it is better his it's a bitter door guru especially which once you let it settle and you go following it it is better you keep tasting it over and over and over again but that milk was so boring the milk chocolate is so boring that it makes this actually tastes good it's this dark and it tastes like Hades and it tastes like a cheap dark chocolate okay white might as well do all milk dark white the basic ones first that's good white chocolate it's like pinball but it's not it actually that's the best of the three definitely know that has a really good white white flavor it's not as good as the milk I like I've said no and have opens them but I really like that I think I would pick it so far I will pick out all those I think it's creamy but it's not smooth and I'm glad they only did give us one milk one because I wouldn't even want to eat those the white ones at least I would want to eat those look Riley praline I'm assuming asking me like the same one that's all sticks mm-hmm it's like a hazelnut chocolate it is really good I like what's the difference that that and the hazelnut it's weird because I think now I enjoyed eating that praline and that little bitty bite more than in the stick and it's not messy you didn't get the melting chocolate on your fingers or anything I liked it then it's the table mat and it's all hazelnuts in now a lot of all of us my favorite is the praline hmm that hazelnut wasn't very strong wasn't no I didn't have a strong chocolate flavor no we're used to the hazelnut from from Germany and I know their rival nuts oh my by either one of this I would like I like the white a lot I think it's good white chocolate and I do like the praline when I recommend you go out and pay seven dollars and fifty eight cents for this or five dollars without no don't no only good worth it unless don't even if you had a candy dish to put these out that's what I'm thinking I was thinking if you had a candy dish you were trying to impress people if you did make it cheap chocolate and put it out if you wanted to impress people with your Nestle job look maybe it's just not that impressive to me no it's really not the white the pralines good if you liked our talk but it was okay you know it's not bad talk about that better chocolate yeah yeah we're just I think we've gotten spoiled we've just we've had so much good chocolate sent to us that this was kind of disappointing but this is from Switzerland I mean you think that but I did like the white so there's that so we'll probably be keeping the white and the praline and then we'll probably pass the rest along to someone give the dark and all the arrests to Andrew so but I hope you enjoyed the video I'm not gonna put pictures at the end because basically you are singing and what there was which is just it's just chocolate it's it's not aware of chocolate yeah it's really not that big of a deal to say so but I hope you enjoyed getting to hear about them and thanks for watching", "3zf83HBhz9g": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying these dove milk chocolate holiday mint cookie promises they were 350 at Target and I'm pretty sure they are target

and we're gonna top it off raspberry creams done in white chocolate with raspberry oh well you know red reddish colored sugar on top this is brand new we've never done this before we're trying to do different toppings yeah so did you just put a confessionary sugar in there and then just add red food dye to swirl it around yep this all attached to and it's a is an important family yeah this woman is from Greg from lofty pursuits he lost some spoons from Tallahassee so you were talking about doing the powdered sugar the last time we were mixing around the granulated sugar food coloring yeah just the yeah we were gonna do that cuz done we thought I saw oh how nice this could be on top and I thought we'll try this yeah just for a different look this is my high talk this is how you do it high-tech device really chic all right because I'll have one shot hands in the chocolate one hand grabbing the creams I can't have the sugar on my hands too well and grabbing the creams and might be melted on my hands and be a whole big thing yeah be mess raspberry covered I mean the white chocolate covering over raspberr raspberry covered white chocolate dreams raspberry cream covered white chocolate right raspberry creams with white chocolate and these are the ones that Greg did yeah these are the ones that Greg did from lofty pursuits we're doing collabs even one is not here yeah I think he'll have the the video of him learning how to cover or how to do the porn star screams in in one of his videos but I I started filming him learning but it was just you can't really fit more than two people back there anyway no people are ready it's kind of a stretch yeah resistor first time ever decorating with a confectionery sugar we would pick to cope yeah and then well you got some use a Dixie cup for the in Rover before for slightly different types of else yeah we just use a Dixie cup it's easiest work yeah yeah looks good yeah nice there's some monsters there's some big mountains and covered okay we'll be able to put these in a box cuz they're too big he'll be he'll be hitting the top of the box we get squished so we'll put these on for samples yeah z overfilled some of them yeah they're you know he's never done it before so it's gonna happen yeah I be surprising if he didn't yeah I think what max was doing it he wasn't filling them enough yeah we max the warning he under filled them then he overfilled oh man he's finally got it takes a while yeah when you do you remember when you were starting yeah the same thing I think I made them too big and stuff when I first started that's normal yeah it's kind of hard to I'm attorney for your Hanukkah no I'll do that yeah that's the one so figure out how to do this yeah cuz you're going to hear one hand so yeah one more decorating is a big one they're huge tip did you ever eat chocolate cover the big one the biggest ones I think people probably see that these are the biggest ones yeah people want to see like ones like so that's what they look like when they're [Applause] good work dad thanks but didn't go off my finger right we ever go all right I'm getting this down now you don't look so bad yourself Josh you come up with the idea to do a convention of sugar just trying to come up with a different decoration and you said you've never even done the white chocolate in the red break no the first time for raspberry it's not gonna be a good good idea I think combo yep some flavors wouldn't be good with white chocolate yeah what would be what do you think would be a really gross flavor which off that well wintergreen of course we don't don't wintergreen one degree dreams yeah actually I used to a long time ago wintergreen creams what flavors I don't know but Irish Cream day weird yeah Irish cream every weird Kovu all the all those flavors yeah and people are asking when we move our we're still gonna make Indy the same way and of course the answer is just yeah we're not gonna change it again to any different disco we're just gonna have more room gonna make robots we're just gonna making candy a way to be we're gonna have room that'll be awesome yeah instead of hitting their heads and ducking and twisting and turning to get through little tight spaces all the time [Laughter] and the shop was gonna be dedicated to my grandfather yeah because he's the one that started this and I was going through all his old files and I realized by going through all the files at me he was trying to do the same thing we're doing now but he didn't have the help from the family didn't you mean they did I wanted to move yeah he wanted to the store could be he wanted to build a new store someplace yeah and he didn't have the help he needed from the family so now you know if he was around he'd probably be pretty collab yeah to see this and to know that people around the world are wanting or dropping out yeah whoo that has been some UK can Germany and a lot of disappointed people in Australia poor people in Australia different parts I like South America and Asia yeah they can't get hurt there's a certain places that we can you know if there's always there's always gonna be like the same we're always gonna get the same questions like we always think like oh you know what we're gonna have we're gonna be able to stop answering this question in a couple years nope so people always ask why we can't ship to places like Australia the reason why they can't ship to Australia really so it takes it'll take five days to get there and we only have poll tax in the last two days so those are the three to four days afterwards that's going to be leaking of box and you're still gonna have to pay a lot because just yeah yeah just going that pack is the other side of the yeah just that point you might as well just not even use cold past it's really only good for two days then we're going to UK is around 80 85 bucks as it is so to go there and be double that at least oh yeah and then the the cope adding cold packs really doesn't add that much it's mostly just the shipping the oh it's not too cold Amex that's the main thing yeah until they develop what they had on Star Trek teleportation teleportation it's gonna be hard to get there yeah I don't know how they well they must make their own chocolate over there and stuff because yeah they would still have that problem over there to get products yeah I know there's some some Australian candy company that we follow on Instagram I think we thought they were doing a lot of stuff on snapchat a little while ago back when we were more active on snapchat I think I tried to post on that snapchat somewhat recently and it like was still trying to load and I was like and then also it's like really and I just don't like to set up anymore of snap answer like I'm Melissa different stick to Instagram but if snapchat changes like how things like how the menu system and stuff works maybe I'll go back there who knows least a grand markup right yeah I think so I can take a picture and then put it on there yeah Wow you've got the power I'll shake it all this that I finally got a little bit out of it came out like a blood splatter oh well we try and try and try good job [Music] okay I got it well I just went over to the new store this morning yeah we're putting the walls up now yeah so he said when we come back we want to come back tonight you'll see all the walls up oh yeah that's great yeah I think tomorrow I'm probably be doing a video of just like what we're doing throughout the day so I think gonna have mom go or to the store in the morn and update people maybe we'll even take some pictures for instance yeah baby a little puppy on Instagram well way before this is up so that bonus on Instagram now at the time alright I got it now yeah Mack what are you making over there goes my job cream how fast you're making more of these yep it sounds like something that could do this is we're gonna make them in melt chocolate and dark chocolate and how many trays did very good would he do maybe like a half the tray the corn search grateful half a half a tray and so with this a bolt rang when you brought those are two trays out as long as I was doing the cream eyeliner to do at least two trays or so yeah so they want to be honest tasting I guess I can do it you're real real hero of sex question your salaries they need us tastes like raspberry it doesn't need any more good I don't think so should I try one of these every day not that I don't trust you almost but yep ha Wow service alright survey says perfect I'm gonna pull the deads right here dude just Thanks you just like abusing your power don't ya change my stuck in this chair possibly get up change my glove all right I'll hold on but I'm gonna switch the funnel I think Oh Oh is your hand like semi sweaty that's good okay yeah sorry about that no that's not super fun yeah when your gloves are just put on kind of weird it does feel comfortable like knowing a third layer of skin that's not quite on right like if someone puts a hat on you or put kids you put sunglasses on your face it's always like oh just a tiny bit uncomfortable have you ever done that thing where you bring your finger up to your forehead but you don't touch your forehead okay you can like feel it so we did it yeah it's like almost like that just a couple more for this right okay well there's a real tiny my another sample one more than others pretty small boy we could do this without truffles - yeah we could roll them in the red confectionery sugar when we do like strawberry or raspberry there voila a man shows how it's done oh you already showed us how yeah the still separating of the cups trick all the way from nobody and you know it she's really be so texture fast how many cups you're in each Bundle cups I don't even think it's standardized poetry is it you just making up numbers you heard nine your I heard someone say 25 recently sounds like a big number let's say that up in 1213 you can't go past 13 and I this dress if I count out loud but I don't if I count my hat okay did you really know your be working at 24 out of this it's okay nice it doesn't matter later Macke it's 25 great - James you got 20 for the first time 25 second I'm sorry about 24 and a half really where's the half cup that's 25 did all right dude yeah you know what maybe you should count them but I have two here so it'll add 250 this time but you got it dude I didn't use my lord kids voice you got a dude I don't know you could try all you want I don't think you're gonna sound this awesome you remember kid snippets - yeah that's great you know what let's put one in a Red Cow yeah got that what lesson egg this the thing fell out of the box it was funnel over I was bouncing around in the air and then I caught it Cheston mm show did show did we did yes mom said put them in a brown Cup well it does kind of make them pop a little bit more yeah the dark is just dark I don't know if you should be seeing them I'm gonna see this she can take them both off this shower I think I should you only know you're disagreeing with her dad cuz as you're putting them down it looks kind of Halloweeny or something you know yeah okay a family show you're putting the back one son and they just looked a little Halloweeny or something so you threw one your red cup to see he still want those red ones are in Spain where this okay do you want to see one or white I think max over think that's what that's a third time I've seen your dad hey write about son say winner yeah [Laughter] you're that dad not too many opportunities dead their dad said max its max of the victory dance isn't well-practiced come on come on in how many victories we can't jump up and down ha ha ha like I said tell you a third one in the past year that's three ways to victory dance to this he'll just jump just because I can like Adam [Music] so you take them out to the stick and put it back in oh yeah that's how we do things in particular and then take it out again yeah yeah obviously that's where all my muscles came from is picking up and putting down paper cups both of my mind to that like how do they get him like that yeah cuz they don't do that once you take them out you must have a machine it's gonna come out of your paycheck well alright wait I'm givin up on it [Music] [Music] all right what was that bar and SpongeBob like weenies weenie huh tree huh doing here don't pretend like you didn't know like when you said Halloweeny it kind of made me think uh huh yeah I saw you crack it up over there and I was like is it that funny wow this is all it takes huh just remind me like those Italian Christmas cookies okay I forgot that whole Italian class thank you everybody like that so yeah the decimal one that's too big for the the matter Oh what's too bad it's only like poison sighs yeah well my place says but it's just definitely taller than the other ones man it's it really is difficult though I got a say hey you don't even have to talk too much well oh no here but I mean pouring the creams oh yes that's how they get the size variance there yeah you don't want to see me do it I don't want to see me do it yeah I don't want to see myself there my job you're like Johnny Depp whenever we've been watching it your own video yeah I'll take that yeah I was like Johnny Depp yeah I don't know if he would agree but you know this is like the first time I've ever used two hands you like yeah I just got this one just got that right hand he's my little clumsy yeah I have a master date yet it's all I've been 26 years right so now I'll just do a time lapse for this part right here so then at the end you should be like hmm I finally got the hang of it first I don't know something about you doing it question it's that fast where you're a time-lapse me doing the rest of Homer just yeah just body said I'm on top of training part the top that's right to others not too shabby for just having that one new arm yeah well I'm a quick learner so you know you know cooks deep to lunch dad but did you guys call around the house yeah it's quick dad yeah is actually his name is actually dad oh really yeah Wow Aaron Cuban name so Steve like his middle name or something and that's why they went by that when he was a kid yeah before that it was okay though yeah yeah it's kind of like sharing a room with your sister you know at a certain point this is the most fun part I don't know how many of our viewers used to play don't break the ice but this is just like building that we actually brought it to a bunch of indoor track knees and we would just turn if I can believe that yeah and we would play other kids from other teams you might have beaten us on the track but you can always hit the why they got like the new version so lame there's a new version of it well you know they just doctored it up so it's a little bit more modern most people if people are wondering about with stack things you just put some wax paper down cardboard on top another layer candy wax paper cardboard another layer candy so you can't fit anymore well that's usually about it but yeah I think we try to do three five layers max as I just said this gently placed the top of the box on top all right bet you can't guess I'm gonna do it this time these are like actually way more crisp than the other colored cups yeah I don't know what's up with that like with the other ones as you're trying to slide them off like this they won't slide off the bottom the whole stack will break into I mean and then once it breaks into you can't slide them off the bottom anymore you have to pull them out of the top it's like it's yeah it took two of them stick together yeah these are definitely the best job awesome sugar yeah it actually looks pretty cool yeah you know it's got like the hard kick or the hard sugar and the Potter true yeah and they'd probably be I'm pretty decent against mr yeah I was gonna like that too alright let's not talk the next minute or eight Jeannie [Music] now I'm gonna cut open the baby brother people like sing stuff cut open a real I do [Music]", "z9u8sITHwDI": "[Music] it was his home and it's time for [Music] Charlotte Brady well that was rather insane yeah that's kind of the theme of the day insanity if you're not insane then there's something seriously wrong with you so with that in mind they have a combo of chocolate delights to wow your senses and make him brain just die so here we go we have some Mook chocolate Meiji a little like that yeah is a a mage I have no idea where that room Japan Japan and it's milk chocolate milk milk milk milk milk milk milk milk milk yeah no the next time you are required to say the word milk wow your friends by using the correct pronounce a pronunciation of milk just think of M LK milk shiny but I mean it's milk chocolate that's great but why this is this is the thing that's really weirded me out why who was like hey I'm thirsty I'm hungry let's take some milk from an animal I mean if I went up to like somebody was like hey that dog over there is lactating let's have some dog milk you'd think I was like disgusting and freaked out right but it's okay to go to up to a cow and do it how's the gross - I just don't get it I buy goats but not dogs no dog milking a horse milk maybe it's just because cows produce a lot of milk but what milks what kind of milk do cows drink cow's milk what kind of milk do dogs drink dog milk what kind of milk do people drink oh go and people but for a very short time what if this bar was actually made out of people milk and what if there was a huge thing that happened and all of a sudden products made from human milk became hugely popular that was just kind of like one of those weird stories but there was some story about an ice cream parlor that was actually selling breast milk flavored ice cream flavored flavor or infused flavored it tasted like breast milk I don't know I've never really I've heard about people saving and putting in their coffee it's funny though because it's not gross when you're a baby but when you're in the doll it's like oh my god that's disgusting alright do you know like if you haven't tried it like how do you know it's disgusting what if it's really good you know kind of like how they'll cuz like some people think cow's milk businessman and then there's a lot of people that really like it I guess technically the same thing can be said about poo though no no how do you know maybe there's some things that smell bad but they actually taste really cocaine any by the sword of Kahless end this conversation of mountain dog and breast milk from humans and animals by kail asses blade whoa you're getting all kinds of crazy with that thing I'm gonna take it away alright you you like for this one it says amazing hi one word to describe dry mmm Pierson Pierson Pierson isn't that at Brad what do we talked about it before that cheap cheap chocolate Pierson whatever it was I'm giving this a half a star it's just boring it's just not doing it for me mmm-hmm it doesn't even really taste super chocolaty until you're about halfway through chewing it and even then then it's not like chocolate chocolate it's all just like eating sugar yeah I mean the conversation that about milk and the idea of you know that was tastier than this half a star oh yeah let me start I'm good with one one storm I'm feeling generous well mr. generous what do you have to save us from that white chalk by the our favorite people over at lint the white winch on Sears maybe he's made of the chocolatiers brass that's why it's you never know is it in the ingredients human breast milk well I'm not even gonna check okay cuz I don't want to do you know it is it's a fantasy totally read you know it smells like oh whoa it's gonna sound flat to me it just smells like cake frosting only buttercream frosting like if you were gonna get like a birthday cake flavored oh wow you don't have to cut him or nothing there's some kind of weird design on it alright it's already melting in my fingers mm-hmm like those little round truffles that they have [Music] that's respectable yeah see that's what I'm thinking when I think the Lindt chocolate tears hard at work making it yeah make it more like this is actually classy and decent where the other ones are just like crap yeah this is this is good I will give that 4.75 this one has the goo in the middle the other one is the other one wasn't the other ones did too yeah but it wasn't like quality goo it was back room and back room 3 a.m. listen to the five I really like this one I'll give this one a four point seven five because I think there could be something going

be\nmaking some chocolate. Channeling my inner Lucille Ball, I'm getting my hairnet on and I'm gonna go work the chocolate line. (upbeat music) I'm Leslie Sbrocco. Come on and taste this. All right, I have officially\ncrossed the line now. (laughing) Hey, Greg! I'm with the Bean Man. It's the Thirsty Girl meets the Bean Man. I love it! All right, we're gonna make some chocolate today, aren't we? - We are! - All we're gonna do is do beans, cracking, melanging, wrapping, sorting, blocking, winnowing, roasting, tempering and b-- I just wanna know about the eating part. (laughs) We'll get to the eating part? - We'll get there. - Okay, the bean room. This is a quiet room. - This is our bean room. This is the quiet room. What happens in this bean room stays in the bean room, that's the slogan. - We're in the cone of silence? - We're in the cone of silence. - How many different types of cocoa beans, like three different types, yeah? - So most people will talk about forastero, criollo and trinitario. - Right. - There was a paper-- - That's what I was\ngonna say, there's three. - And then in 2008,\nthere was a paper written that said nh, no, no,\nthere's actually like 10. - Okay. - And now the USD is working on a paper that says there's actually 20. I would say we're a couple hundred years behind grapes, where in the wine world everyone understands-- - There's thousands of varieties. - Exactly, exactly. Do you wanna see a fresh pod? - I do. It looks like something from Alien. - It does! I always say that! - It looks like you could reach into your innards and pull that out. So this is the actual cacao bean. - Exactly, you can pop it in your mouth right now\n- okay, I'm gonna do it. and try it. - I'll just see. - I wouldn't bite into the bean. Have you already bitten into--\n- No, no. - Okay you're smart. How is it? - It's very mild. - Yeah. - And a little bit like a\nlychee nut, like a lychee. Yeah? - You're dead on. And these are unroasted cocoa beans. What some people would\ncall raw cocoa beans, I don't like to use the term raw. Only because these have been fermented. These are not live seeds by any stretch of the imagination. - Right. - So these are unroasted cocoa beans. - And this is what you get in those sacks. - This is what we get in those sacks. And the different varieties will have different florals and fruitiness and the pulp tastes very different. That sugar in that pulp is what drives the fermentation process. People on our production team will sort through these beans to\npull out the bad ones. One batch of chocolate is 30 kilograms. - So a small batch, we're\ntalking small batch here. - This is tiny. Well, so now let's head over to what we do with it. Here's our roaster. - So it's roasting beans. How long does this process take? - So we basically develop a roast profile for every single bean and they vary from like 18 minutes to half an hour. - Okay. All right, so all you have to do is kinda crush it like\nthat, twist it, right? Oh, there it is! There's the whole nib! - Exactly. - Look at that! - That's what we make chocolate out of. - Oh my God, that's good. - Isn't that tasty? This is an impact breaker. A bean comes down onto it and gets shot against\nthe side and shatters. What you can see there is like whole beans and pieces of husk in there still. This machine here is a winnower. There's a vacuum that sucks the husk away. You can see we have nibs at the end of that process. The nibs are half fat. It's like a peanut. If you grind up a peanut, you get a paste. So now what we have is melangers. There's two stone wheels\nand a stone bottom and these stone wheels are\ngrinding up those nibs. - So there is nothing\nmore in here than the nib. - Well, nib and then sugar. - This when you add the sugar. - The good stuff, yeah, exactly. - Okay. - And these are 70%\ncocoa beans, 30% sugar, nothing else is in there. And then what you end up having is this lovely smooth chocolate. - So all of your chocolate is 70% cocoa? - We make one 85% bar and one 100% bar for people who are like bah, sugar. - Die-hard, yeah. - It was warm. It was creamy. - Right. - It's got a little bit of bitterness. It's got a little bit of that zesty acid. Kinda ohh my God! - Okay, you're in Belize-- - And now I'm off to Costa Rica. - Now you're off to Costa Rica. - Okay. I get more spice in this one! - Ahhh, right! - Very different-tasting,\nincredibly different tasting. - And that's why we do this, that's why we spend all this time traveling around the\nworld to get cocoa beans. Now we're tempering. What we've essentially done heat all the chocolate up,\nmelt all the crystals out, cool it down and then reheat it, so you're getting just the\nfour and five crystals. If you don't temper correctly, what happens is the fat and those solids will split out and separate\nout from each other and then you get that weird-- - That white-looking thing on top? - Exactly. - Okay. - It's just fat. Okay, now you can see Dmitri--\n- Fill the forms. - Fill the mold and then Kya is vibrating all the air bubbles out. You want a beautiful chocolate bar, right? - You do! - You want all the bubbles out. - I gotta tell you, this reminds me of Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory! - It does. This is the waterfall. - I want the Oompa-Loompas coming out, Oompa-Loompa - And then the last stage is sorting through the chocolate bars to figure out which ones\npass quality control. So this is chocolate tempered\njust today just for you. - And which one is this,\nEcuador, Costa Rica, Madagascar? - This is Maya Mountain,\nthis is what you tasted in the melanger. - This is what I tasted in the melanger. Belize from the melanger. - Belize eats this chocolate. - Through the temperer in my mouth! - Right? - The important thing is the sound, right? With champagne, it's the pop. With chocolate, it's? - It's the snap. - It's the snap. - It's all about the snap of that bar. - All right, cheers. - Cheers. - You gotta taste this. So most of the stimulant\nyou're getting in chocolate is actually theobromine, not caffeine. - I'm gonna do my little\nshot of theobromine.

welcome back to maverick baking and welcome back to another recipe video today we're getting a little bit seasonal it's something very kind of fresh and spring appropriate while also being as kind of wonderfully indulgent as all the other recipes on this channel are today i'm going to be talking you through not only one of my favorite recipes but one of the most popular recipes on my blog of all time and one of the kind of most watched recipe videos on this very channel even though the video is a terrible quality and is like five years old now today i'm going to be talking you guys step by step through how to make blondies if you have never yet met a blondie it's basically the kind of feisty little sister of the much-loved brownie everything that is milk and dark chocolate in a brownie is white chocolate in a blondie but it's every bit as rich fudgy and wonderful so in this video i'm going to take you through exactly how to make the best super fudgy white chocolate blondies and then we're going to taste them together let's go [Music] here we have the ingredients we're going to need for these lovely white chocolate blondies in this first bowl we have salted butter and white chocolate it's always best to use the best white chocolate that you can afford so we're going to melt both of these things together just over a little double boiler or bain marie with just a little tiny bit of simmering water now you want to do this as gently as you possibly can white chocolate is a lot more kind of temperamental due to its ingredients than normal chocolate which means you don't want to expose it to too high heat so once these have melted really really smoothly together we can get onto our other ingredients so in a separate large bowl you're gonna have your caster sugar now you can use granulated but castor is just the best in my opinion because of how lovely and fine it is to that we're going to need to add three large eggs and just a little bit of vanilla extract i had just a tiny bit left in this bottle i also wanted to add some lemon but that is totally optional for you so we have our white chocolate and butter cooling on the side slightly we're just going to add our three large eggs straight into that caster sugar and you want to just use a hand whisk to get in there and just mingle them about you don't need to get any air in or you know pull a muscle trying to do this just weak them about enough so that they just get all friendly and incorporated with each other then you're going to want to chuck in that vanilla extract always use a bit more than you think you need and also at this stage this is where i added my lemon zest again totally optional but i just love the flavor it adds just grating in a gentle amount is perfect once you've done that you can just grab your whisk again and just give it a wee kind of shoot around until it's all mixed in nicely it shouldn't take too long and by this stage you should have nice sort of gooey eggy sugary ribbons this is the texture you're looking for once you have that you're going to slowly pour in your chocolate and butter mixture until you have a wonderfully gooey thick mixture with everything all mixed in next we're going to need to add our dry ingredients for this we have some plain flour no need for any raising agent so we don't want these to puff up and we also have some white chocolate again do try and use the best that you can afford we're just going to chuck this all straight in to our lovely gooey mixture and just give it a gentle whisk until you have a perfectly golden blondie batter then you're going to want to grab a kind of eight by eight inch square tin you're going to want to grease it generously and just shove a wee layer of greaseproof paper down just kind of enough to have an overhang at the sides something along the lines of this and you're going to want to get your batter in there smooth it out as much as you can do not forget to lick the spoon then if you have any kind of other white chocolatey bits lying around feel free to chuck them on i had these white chocolate egg things just because it's around easter while i'm filming this so i just chucked them in and then of course it's time to get them into the oven to bake and you know do the dishes and all that kind of boring stuff but after about 40 to 45 minutes you'll have these gloriously fudgy gooey dense rich chocolatey buttery blondies that you will not be able to keep your greedy little fingers away from seriously seriously good stuff so here we have our gloriously fully baked blondies now as you can probably see they are so so super fudgy so i think one of the main problems that people kind of encounter when trying blondie's for the first time is because of the color being quite pale you expect more of a cakey kind of texture than you do fudgy so a lot of people aren't really into that fudginess when it comes to white chocolate because it's just a bit of a mental hurdle they have to get over whereas a brownie or a chocolate cake you expect to be dense heavy and moist often with a cake this color you expect something kind of light blondies are not light and nor should they be light if your blondie is cakey either you've over baked it or you've probably used a recipe that is a bit more intended to make cake bars and some people even try to make their blondies into kind of cookie bar type things that's not the way i like to roll anyway shall we taste this beauty and see how it is so soft so kind of velvety you barely even need to chew it it just sort of wonderfully melts in the mouth it's rich it's buttery the amount of sugar in it isn't kind of too much to make it overwhelming you've got that gorgeous gentle vanilla flavor from the extract and from the white chocolate if you do decide to add the lemon zest it makes a gorgeous little kind of extra bit of flavor an extra bit of freshness but also really compliments the sweetness in here if you love white chocolate if you love vanilla if you love the texture of brownies but you're sometimes overwhelmed by that strong cocoa flavor you really need to try these i seriously recommend trying them super super simple and definitely worth the end result plus these keep for up to like four or five days which is perfect in current restrictions where we aren't able to see friends and family as much to share them if you're the kind of person who shares of course if you do try this recipe or if you're a fan of blondie's normally do let me know in the comments i'm a big fan of blondie's and i've converted quite a few people with this recipe but i'm afraid that is all we have time for today guys thank you so much for coming along with me to make this beautiful batch of blondies today i hope

Chocolate can be prepared in many ways like molded chocolate, coated, layered, filled and clustered chocolate. Today we will make molded chocolate. Let\u2019s see what all ingredients are required for making molded chocolate. Dark compound There are solid particles of dark cocoa. It is also known as dark compound or dark chocolate. White compound It consists of cocoa butter. It is known as white compound or white chocolate. Dry fruits We have used walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds and raisins. For making molded chocolate we will melt chocolate first. Firstly break or crush the chocolate and then melt it. We can melt chocolates in two methods. One by using double boiler and second by using microwave It takes few minutes for melting chocolate in microwave whereas melting chocolate in double boiler is a tough job. Today we will melt chocolate in double boiler. Crush the chocolate and then melt it. While buying chocolate do check the manufacturing date as melting expired chocolate takes much time. Cut it like this or with help of some heavy matter crush the chocolate. After breaking the chocolate place it in utensil for melting. The beneath utensil has around 1-1. 5 cup of water which is getting warm constantly. Above it we have placed another utensil whisk doesn\u2019t sink in the water. Now place the chocolate into it. Stir the chocolate with help of a spoon. Make a note that not a single drop of water should not get into the chocolate. The utensil as well as spoon should be completely dry. Keep stirring at regular intervals. The more finely crushed it is the lesser time it will take to melt. Meanwhile cut white chocolate. White chocolate is soft as compared to dark chocolate. Keep a constant check on dark chocolate placed for melting. Stir after every 1-1.5 minute. Place the white in another bowl and melt it. Stir chocolates until they get melted completely. Place a spoon like this so that steam escapes easily. Chocolate can\u2019t be melted on high temperature as if it gets overheated it won\u2019t melt easily. Melt the dark chocolate on 120 degree centigrade. Melt white chocolate on 110 degree centigrade. We don\u2019t have confectionary thermometer at our homes so keep a check on flame. Keep the flame to a point that there is a constant formation of steam and chocolate melts easily. If you are melting chocolate in microwave then melt the chocolate for 30 seconds or 1 minute. Take out the utensil and stir chocolate thoroughly. If chocolate id not melted, place it back and microwave for 10 or 20 more seconds. Chocolate is melted now. To make frigid the chocolate a bit, add crushed chocolate into it as we cannot work with too much heated chocolate. The process of cooling and heating chocolate is called as tempering. Keep it aside for 3-4 minutes for making it frigid. Now we will mold chocolate. Don\u2019t place the dark and white compound in refrigerator as they get moisten and it becomes hard to melt chocolate. Pat the mold on surface to even chocolate. Place it in freezer for 5 minutes, chocolate will be ready. Meanwhile we will prepare marvel chocolate. For making marvel chocolate firstly pour white chocolate in the mold. Place back the white chocolate on warm water. Now pour dark chocolate in the mold. Keep the mold bit empty. Again pour little amount of white chocolate above it. Pat the mold to even the chocolate. Place it in freezer for 5 minutes so that it gets set. Now we will make dry fruit chocolate. Pour dark chocolate in the mold like this. We will make half of the chocolates with walnuts and half with almonds. Break the walnut into half and place it in chocolate. Place one almond. Fill the mold again with chocolate.  Pat the mold to even out the chocolate. Place it in freezer for 5 minutes, it will get ready. Now will make cashew nuts, raisins and butterscotch chocolate with some more sweetness For this add white compound in dark compound as per your preference. White compound is sweeter as it consists of cocoa butter along with milk powder and sugar. If chocolate has become dry by heating it again so add \u00bd-1 olive oil or any other oil. Chocolate has got frigid. Pour the chocolate in mold keeping it bit empty. Mold should be dry as little moisture will make it difficult to mold chocolate. Now place cashew nuts in center like this for making cashew nuts chocolate. If making raisins chocolate then place two raisins in one mold like this. Keep the dry fruits in center. For making butterscotch chocolate, place 2-3 pieces of butterscotch like this. If you wish to make hazel nut chocolate, then place it in center of the chocolate. Now pour some more chocolate from the top. Fill all molds with chocolate. Pat the mold so that chocolate gets even. Place the mold in freezer for 5 minutes, it will get ready. Chocolate are set. Now take them out from the molds. Flip the mold and pat. Like wise take out the marvel chocolate. Marvel chocolate is ready. Chocolate have come out very shiny. If the compounds are melted properly, then chocolate come out shinny Like wise take out walnut and almond chocolate. Walnut and almond chocolate is also ready. Cashew nuts, raisin and butterscotch are also ready. Tempting chocolates are ready, wrap these chocolates now. For this we will require wrapping sheets. These are chocolate wrapping sheets and we will cut them as per the size of chocolates size. Place the chocolate and wrap it like this. Like wise wrap all chocolates. Wrap all chocolates to prevent them from any kind of moisture. If you want to gift these chocolate to someone then buy baskets or boxes like this from market. Fill chocolate into them and present it to anybody. Luscious chocolates are ready. Chocolate are liked by almost everyone. Try making this recipe at your home and share your experiences with us. See you again at nishamdhulika.com", "V726JdY8FaY": "[Music] hi I'm Andy welcome to sharing cooking secrets today we're going to talk about chocolate one of my favorite favorite things I love chocolate so today I'm going to show you how to melt chocolate there are two ways to melt chocolate one is in the microwave and the more traditional way is the double boiler so let's do the double boiler one first I have a pot of boiling hot water here and I'm not sure if you can see the steam coming out and I have got some chopped chocolate in a in a glass bowl and I'm just placing this on the top and I'm making sure that this does not come in contact with the water okay so we just placed the tail and you can forget about this for a few minutes and leave it like this don't cover this because if you cover this what will happen you will have condensation taking place and water will get into the chocolate and let me tell you one thing water is chocolate biggest enemy so we don't want to get any water in here at all now let's melt some chocolate in the microwave which is super easy I like to use glass bowls so I have about a cup of chocolate in here and we're going to melt this in the microwave now you can notice the chocolate is chopped uniformly that will help you to melt the chocolate season if you follow my instructions carefully you will never burn the chocolate it is very easy to burn chocolate people have a misconception they feel that the more heat you give to the chocolate the faster the chocolate will melt but that's totally wrong chocolate like the gentle heat so we're giving 20 seconds and then we will stop and then we will give another 20-second stop again and if required tensile the 20 seconds is over and I like to just take it out one and give a little mix and put it back for another 20 30 40 seconds now and you can see now the chocolate has started to melt so again I just like to give it a little mix again this prevents any burning of the chocolate [Music] it looks as if it hasn't melted but if you put your whisk or your spoon and you can see it it has melted beautifully now we need to take out all the lumps mix it don't beat this vigorously we don't want air bubbles in it see the bowl is not very hot just war this is a very useful instrument to use to melt the chocolate with as the chocolate gets cooler it will become thicker if you have problems in getting rid of the lump you can always fit this take a steel strainer and you can clip it I'm just going to place this towel here so my chocolate doesn't get too cold and let's see what happens here in the double boiler you can see the chocolate it started melting yes it does take a little bit longer but there is no risk of burning the chocolate one very important tip I want to give you is that whatever you tend to be well using you must make sure that everything is absolutely dry if there is water in your bowl and you add the chocolate the chocolate will see that means the chocolate will go hard and it will not melt so you need to make sure everything is absolutely dry okay let's melt the white chocolate exactly the same way a lot of people have problems melting my chocolate but if you follow my instructions I'm sure you will not have in 20 seconds it's important to chop the chocolate in uniform pieces 20 seconds be nothing much has happened another 20 seconds and you will notice that in the summer the chocolate will melt much faster and in the winter it may take an additional 30 seconds [Music] you can see it started melting it's a good idea to keep a cloth underneath so the marble slab doesn't cool down the chocolate this is already done it's all melted now before removing the bowl always keep a towel handy so when you place this there's no water falling here in there in case the water gets into the chocolate the chocolate we'll see so we have our three bowls of chocolate this one was melted on the double boiler and these two were melted in

choice but there's nothing wrong with it at all it's still very good so just would be my joy would be lovely I like the crunchy better on that chewy yeah but I do really like the flavor and the texture of their chocolate I can't wait to draw this one this building things will be back to 180 with this one alright and this is white this is just same thing but white white chocolate with raisins almonds in Iceland same thing boy their wife is not our vibe no no I don't like it no I like a good milk chocolate their white is just it's not as sweet as our white chocolate so that would not be one

don't be afraid afraid to buy these if you will they're excellent candy water is a very very good quality the only one that we really didn't care for was the one in white chocolate in it just because

the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "HxxILR77iLg": "hi everyone well it's Christmas time again and you know what that means shopping which I hate spending money which I don't like doing family I don't want to see overeating getting crappy presents I don't even want gaining weight Greco enough that negativity it's fun time of the year and I've got a nice little simple easy recipe that you can just take to all your functions or just throw in a table if people come over is quick simple and easy to make with hardly any ingredients it's kind of like a white chocolate fudge with a bit of a Christmas theme so let me show you how to whip up this fantastic little masterpiece okay so for this all you're gonna need is some white chocolate melts some sweetened condensed milk I found some red and green M&Ms perfect for the Christmas theme and I thought I throw it up do like gummy bear things these are gummy babies which somebody has already got into it was probably those mice are the neighbors kids so anyway let's get into making this stuff okay so the first thing we need to do is melt our chocolate milk so we'll just put a bag of chocolate melts into a bowl and now we're just gonna melt these in the microwave we're just gonna put these in the microwave we're just gonna put it just slice open we're just gonna put these in the microwave um I put them on for a minute just to melt while their chocolates melting I'm just gonna line my tin that I'm gonna use spray a bit of oil and black in some parchment or baking paper inside to still not melt it or give it another minute all right well I have a look at that that looks absolutely perfect now we'll just add half a tin of this sweetened condensed milk I'm gonna stir that forward we have a lot of questions saying can I use evaporated milk instead of Swing condensed milk no I guess what you could do is just pull out the red and green ones to keep the Christmas thing now you got time for that stop all a tin and these M&Ms as well come on in and we'll stir that all through okay so once I've done that all we needs to do just pour this mixture into our pre lined tin and just spread it out that's pretty much it done now all you have to do is wait for this is the set I'm gonna stick this in the freezer coz I've got time to stick it in the fridge because last time I always to get in the fridge I'll leave it there overnight and the mice get into it so I'm gonna stick this in the freezer for a couple hours and come back and give it the old taste test all right well I thought I'd try something else today it's about half set it's a tiny bit soft still so I thought I'd just get my knife and just while it's still a bit soft just create little divots cuts slices I guess I'm here this will just make it easier later on for me to get this set up and just break it into edible sized pieces all right back to the freezer all righty well here's that delicious white chocolate fudge that I just whipped up how good does that look so if you left some of this half of Santa it come five times a year right well let's just break some of this off give it the old right well let some of that white chocolate fudge

so it's up to you what you want to use the water is already boiling so we're gonna put this make sure the tip of this bowl will have been attached to the water this is a double double boiling method

forget to like subscribe to my channel and click that notification bell so you always be notified if i have a new video so we'll just melt this butter and you can use cocoa butter it would be much better if you have but if you don't have you can use coconut oil or this unsalted butter it should be unsalted butter so that it will not be sold so this butter is melting already we're gonna put the powdered sugar so we will just melt this sugar along with the butter it should be combined together well this is one third cup sugar i use [Music] now put your powdered milk [Music] and the next is

need to boil water and then do this double boiler learn method [Music] so i take this from the heat so i will just mix this properly [Music] now this is mix already don't over cook this because the butter will gonna be separate on the cocoa powder and the milk so you don't need to over mix this in the hot water so just like this i'm gonna put this on mold and if you don't have mold you can use the foil container like this what i'm using you can always use that and don't worry about the remaining butter it will gonna be gone the few of them will gonna begin later when you see when it freezes so don't worry about it so just tap this and then put this on the fridge fridge bar put it on the fridge for two hours or three hours it depends on you or in the freezer for just 30 minutes it will gonna be cold [Music] so guys here it is after three hours in the fridge i'm gonna take this off in the mold and guys this is so delicious it tastes like cadbury chocolate milk bar it's so delicious

hope you enjoy it guys [Music] you", "iILl6evnDPw": "do you like chocolate it's not ketogenic not yet that's what we're doing today I'm showing you some awesome toppings I'm showing you how to temper it which is really the only tricky part I'm so glad you found this video before we watch this go ahead and subscribe if you haven't already and without further ado let's do this first thing we're going to do is we're gonna get a glass bowl and it's important that we use a glass bowl and not metal one because we're gonna be creating what's called a memory and that's where we put boiling water underneath a bowl to heat up the bowl in a very controlled and precise way so I'm not gonna cheat you guys and just melt down some already made chocolate for these chocolate bars we're gonna control everything here this is the base butter this is actually just like pure fat and this is super keto if you want to make just pure keto chocolate just cocoa powder and cacao butter and boom you got it so this is the beauty of the bain marie it's not gonna overheat and we're gonna actually use a thermometer and when we save a memory hits 95 simply take the bowl off and keep stirring it until the temperature goes back down this is called tempering and we're gonna bring it up to a very specific temperature and that's gonna make the chocolate hard otherwise it's gonna remain soft [Music] and at this point we can just dump in our cocoa powder and that's when this becomes chocolate now it's gonna be very bitter because we don't have any sweetener in it yet of course we can't use sugar so I like using swerve swerve is erythritol and stevia blood and they make a very fine confectioner powder what I'm using is actually the granular time which is why I had to use a mortar and pestle to grind it down into like a finer powder [Music] so I'm gonna be pouring onto a very small silicone tray actually just using my French press the glass insert and my French press so I found this really cute silicone mold at sur La Table at the mall and we're gonna be making these tiny little Hershey fun size bars [Music] the first column I'm just gonna make regular ordinary chocolate just to see how it tastes [Music] and the second column I'm gonna do sea salt and almond slices sea salt works really good with sweet chocolate the third column I'm sprinkling a little bit of instant coffee on it to make these nice little coffee chocolates and lastly I'm using food grade orange oil and some chilli sauce if you don't like spicy just submit the chili oil but man these orange chocolates taste so good orange and dark chocolate works so well together [Music] I think I'm gonna make these a bowl give them away for presents perhaps though my keto friends anyways these turned out so well and bonus points if you can find some gold wrapper for it too to really make it authentic make sure you share the video with someone you know that would love it as always keep it keto and stay healthy peace [Music]", "jjAYeipj0Ws": "[Music] good afternoon fine people of the internet and the not so fine welcome back to maverick baking and welcome back to another chocolate review today we are actually talking about a brand from my native land of scotland yes today we are talking about mary's milk bar now this is a company based in edinburgh that is most known for its ice cream and gelato their shop is based in one of the most gorgeous scenic areas of the old city of edinburgh i love it but i've never actually been into the shop basically every time i've kind of been near the shop it's been out the door busy which is a fantastic sign of course usually i've been in edinburgh on work related things or other sort of events and i don't really have much time to hang around sadly but with all of this global pandemic nonsense going on at the moment they are selling their delicious chocolate bars online and i have finally finally bought some so today we are talking about three flavors of these absolutely stunning hand crafted chocolate bars we are talking about their damn fine cup of coffee dark chocolate which obviously is coffee flavored we are talking about their oat of control bar which has ginger dark chocolate toasted oats and seeds and we also have this rather outrageous sounding white chocolate with nutty roasted kinako powder and black sesame so i think i'm going to start with the damn fine cup of coffee bar and these are all i should mention before i get into them these bars were all four pounds 50 which i know may be a little bit out of some people's budget when it comes to chocolate but it's a standard sort of decent sized chocolate bar it will be delivered contact free through your letterbox as mine was you're supporting a small business and you're also supporting good sort of sustainable ingredients and things like that so even though four pounds 50 is a high price point the price is often worth it okay so let's talk about this particular bar the damn fine cup of coffee so this is a coffee dark chocolate it's a 66 bar so nothing kind of crazy strong or bitter for those of you who aren't big fans of that real ballsy cocoa flavor it also contains some vanilla and a little bit of sugar and some fresh ground coffee from clemson's estate so as i said these bars are handcrafted and you can see they're also lovingly hand wrapped which i just adore listen listen to this sound that is an exciting sound it's this gorgeous sort of lovely waxy paper branded nice little bit of string and a nice i just i like it okay but we're going to get into the bar now and see how it tastes there are people on this planet who don't like chocolate and don't like coffee and just based on that three second sniffing experience i do not understand any of you if anything i actually smell more coffee than chocolate which is interesting and it does smell like freshly ground coffee you can smell there's a little bit of vanilla in there you can smell that this isn't going to be kind of the most bitter chocolate let's see how it tastes though i've spoken to you guys about that snap before it's always a good sign okay so we have some lovely shiny well-tempered chocolate as you saw fairly plain on the kind of presentation front but there's not much you can do with multiple shades of brown in a bar i guess let's see if this chocolate is worth it if you love coffee you're gonna love this so straight away this is obviously a bit of a grown-up flavor this isn't a bar of cadbury's dairy milk it's got a good thickness it's got a nice kind of snap as you're breaking into it and as you're eating it the coffee flavor is the main thing that is overriding everything which when you're buying a coffee flavor chocolate bar is obviously what you were looking for it's a nice fresh tasting coffee there's nothing kind of stale there's nothing kind of freeze-dried instant coffee about it it smells and tastes and has a lingering delicious kind of coffee flavor the kind you would get from a decent quality black coffee or espresso bold without the bitterness because there is that added creaminess and that added you know touch of sugar to the chocolate i must say i don't know if it's the addition of the coffee or if it's just the chocolate itself it's not the smoothest melting chocolate i've ever had it has a decent texture it is you know relatively smooth there's nothing chalky but it's not the smoothest creamiest chocolate i've ever had and i feel like there are grains of that coffee through it which i don't particularly mind especially when it is offering a nice flavor too you can tell there has been sugar added to this bar because there isn't really a kind of lingering cocoa flavor as i've eaten it i can taste a sort of sweetened coffee flavor a little bit like a coffee flavored truffle or some coffee cake there's not a sort of lingering chocolate flavor like there might be in a typical 66 bar that could be because of the added vanilla it could be the sugar it could be a mixture of both but either way in terms of flavor and in terms of being a nice kind of accessible dark chocolate if you're someone who doesn't like it this is a pretty good bar it provides all the flavor it says it will it's nicely presented it has a decent texture i'll give the spot a 4 out of 5. let's move on to the other kind of darker chocolate so this is the oat of control so this is a ginger flavored dark chocolate with toasted oats it says it also contains honey sugar and pumpkin and sunflower seeds so i'm actually wondering if this is almost like a granola chocolate bar but i think this one is lovely not only in its kind of creativity but it's also it feels very scottish ginger is a flavor you see in a lot of scottish foods obviously i know that's probably from kind of times of colonialism when spices were brought here but at least in the lifetimes of the last kind of three generations of scottish people ginger is a very popular flavor whether it's in biscuits whether it's in cakes anything like that scottish people tend to be big on their ginger similarly the oats are an utterly ubiquitous scottish product something that all of us have either grown up eating or being aware of again it's a 66 bar so it's nothing that we're expecting too much kind of bitterness from or anything too super strong okay so similarly on the front we just have your standard sort of cartoon chocolate vibes but on the back this bar has broken but that's to be expected in the post on the back you can see that this bar has a nice little kind of scattering of that toasted oat concoction on it whether it's through the chocolate or just kind of scattered on top i'm not sure it looks as though it might be throughout yes okay so you can see it's kind of throughout let me give you a little bit of a close-up so you can see that there's some fairly chunky oats they appear to be kind of nice and crispy and the smell of that sort of candied ginger is just permeating through every single one of my senses at the moment again not a super strong smell from the chocolate the main powerful smell is that ginger and you get that sort of nice cozy kind of comforting smell from the oats as well that kind of toasty malty vibe let's give the oat of control bar a taste and see how it is it's good so immediately texture-wise i think this butter superior to the first one you have a lovely smooth melting chocolate i think because this bar is uninterrupted by the kind of ground coffee there is a better kind of smoothness a better creaminess a better melt to it the ginger is super super powerful so if you're kind of on the fence about ginger or you're not a fan at all this one's not for you however if you're like me and you love ginger sweet or savory this one is seriously one you may want to try the zing of fresh ginger rather than kind of the warmth of ground ginger that you may find in ginger biscuits or gingerbread for example the chocolate itself again is a little bit lacking in a bold cocoa taste you know speaking to you now sort of a few seconds after finishing a couple of chunks of chocolate the only lingering flavor is that ginger the chocolate's kind of you know it's not really there again i don't know if that's the addition of the sugar and the vanilla that's kind of masking that flavor some people may not mind that but i do think when you're buying a bar that has such a high cocoa percentage to only taste the flavorings you know you do kind of want a mix of both however that being said i love the granola vibes in this bar you get a lingering kind of nice granola flavor from those toasted oats they provide a great texture they break up the sort of mundanity that you might say of a solid chocolate bar if it's not your thing you get crunch on those seeds you get a little bit flavor in each bite from the different elements of those kind of granola things and of course the ginger pairs really well with them it makes it feel almost very autumnal which is really nice it's definitely a unique bar it's not something i've ever tried before and there is something that feels quite uniquely scottish about it even though i think the chocolate itself could be improved upon i love the flavor i love the creativity and i do enjoy the execution so i'm gonna give that another four out of five okay i think it's time to move on to the bar that i am most excited about so this is called how to get to sesame's treat very clever so this is white chocolate just made with your standard sort of sugar cocoa butter milk vanilla with roasted soy bean flour which is what i believe this kinako is it also has black sesame and salt added to it i am really really excited about this one i know that adding sesame flavor and in eastern asia is very common i know that in china and japan i believe it's done quite a lot in things like ice cream and cakes and i think the color is always stunning because it always comes out as a sort of black and white or this gray food stuff which we just don't see a lot of over here and i think to add this to such a familiar product here in the uk in white chocolate is something really bold so we open up and what a gorgeous exterior we're meant with the color and the contrast is absolutely stunning so of course you can see that we have this lovely off-white white chocolate there and you have those little flecks of the black sesame seeds and little kind of smatterings of that roasted soybean in there as well i am really excited to try this i must say the smell is nothing too kind of new to me if you were just to hand this to me and i had my eyes closed i probably couldn't tell you what was in this the only thing i do actually smell is that sort of milky vanilla smell of white chocolate but let's get into the flavor and see if that sesame is coming through very very very subtle very complex actually that is so unique and so kind of confusing to my palette that my mouth cannot stop watering the contrast of the flavors in there is something i have never ever tasted before to the point that i do not want to stop eating this because i want to kind of educate myself on it as well as devour it because it's really good so the white chocolate is everything you want from white chocolate it's sweet it's creamy it requires absolutely no effort to consume because it just melts in the mouth it's got that milkiness it's got that vanilla kind of flavor there's none of that chalkiness that you get with super cheap white chocolate which i'm never really a fan of but this is really really what you want from white chocolate the flavor is so different you have this really really subtle savory sesame flavor in the background there's a little bit of sea salt in there which also helps you pick up on those flavors and definitely i think in the aftertaste because white chocolate doesn't offer any sort of lingering cocoa flavors you're left with that sort of richness of the sesame and that soybean flavor in the background that is really really strange it just has these little kind of kisses and smatterings of that sesame flavor through it like a drizzle of sesame oil over some vanilla ice cream or some toasted sesame seeds on a milkshake it's that subtle but it really works it really really works definitely in the way of uniqueness in the way of appearance in the way of delivering on flavor this is a five out of five mostly because i can barely even put into words how much i admire it overall pretty impressed would recommend and there are many many other flavors to choose from i just decided to pick three that appeal to me but of course i will drop the link to manny's milk bar in the description box below so you can check them out for yourself if you guys have ever tried anything from babies not far be it their ice cream their chocolates anything let me know in the comments below i will get there for some ice cream once things are back to normal i really need to especially after trying all their different flavor paintings here in the meantime if you guys enjoyed today's video don't forget to drop a big voluptuous thumbs up and to hit that subscribe button if you're new here because i would be honored to see you again but at the moment that's all i have time for today guys i need to go and write down some notes about this chocolate because i am all very excited about it and i will see you for the next one", "y73APhFSjVY": "welcome to mark reviews and you may have noticed already I have a little bit of remodeling going on trying to create a better more dynamic background for some of the reviews that I post so subscribe now to be notified when I post new videos and overtime over the next few weeks you'll start to see the evolution of this space and in the meantime you've seen me do reviews on Oreos and I have one review on a special kind of M&Ms that's buried back in the history of this channel I tried strawberry nut I was in the checkout at Walmart today and in that impulse buying section I saw another kind of M&M that intrigued me and I'm talking about the racial unity M&Ms that's not actually what they're called this is the double chocolate M&M so there's white chocolate and dark chocolate white chocolate yeah dark chocolate and white chocolate so I have never tried these before but I'm intrigued because I do like good white chocolate good being like those in window or balls like went white chocolate and kind of on the lower end you get like the Hershey's cookies and cream bars or the Hershey's hugs that have some white chocolate to them so I saw these than they intrigued me and for just over a dollar I thought was worth trying okay so first and foremost I don't see an easy way to open the other thing you could like pull the end open okay well they don't look super appetizing okay part of the appeal of M&Ms is like that carnival of different colors I'll show you here there's a lot of really dark one so it looks like about four shades of colors here so you have kind of this this off-white like an ivory color kind of this caramel tannish color there's a slightly darker just like we would call just a normal brown like a leathery Brown and then you know color that you're familiar with now when I was a kid let's go back to that one when I was a kid this color was normal in a normal pack of M&Ms and there was no blue M&M we voted on that when I was in school and we changed tan to blue so you're welcome because blue is better color it's more appetizing but you're used to this brown color okay that is way too many and as you know they say they melt in your mouth not in your hands but they actually melt in your hands too so I'm gonna try I don't know whether the M&Ms are in fact half and half like half white chocolate half dark chocolate like this show on the package or if like bees or white chocolates I'm gonna try that first I'm gonna give you like a cutaway view here well okay so candy shell thin layer of dark chocolate white chocolate in the middle now initial impression it tastes a little bit like a Hershey's hug but there's more of a bite to it despite the you know the generous proportion of white chocolate to the dark chocolate I still feel that light from the dark let's try this okay so this is gonna confirm it for me pretty sure everyone as a cutaway view like that see that because that was the caramel colored one here's the dark one yeah if any of them were gonna be straight dark chocolate it would be the black one right the darkest one that's not alright now that I've had a few flavors starting to kind of synthesize mmm looks like though it's more similar to that Hershey's cookies and cream bar than inant that it is to a Hershey's hug and then the candy shell almost throws it off maybe it's because I've never had a white chocolate in a candy shell but that part of this is not exactly working is it good it's an M&M have you ever had a bad M&M not me so double chocolate what's really I mean it's the same amount of chocolate these are about the size of peanut butter M&Ms like almost exactly they may even be produced on the exact same machine but instead of that thin layer of chocolate and then peanut butter in the middle the peanut bite is through another hologram the peanut butter has been replaced by white chocolate so peanut butter M&M white chocolate instead of peanut butter that's what these are and they're good I mean it works it tastes more like hot cocoa that's probably how I would describe it or like if if you happen to have visited Spain ever and you have Cola cow chocolate powder they put in milk kind of tastes like that so if you make hot cocoa like Swiss Miss or Stephens hot cocoa or whatever then you mix it in milk instead of water tastes pretty much like this but an add a candy crunch so yeah all right that's enough I'm gonna

why is it so important that I have to talk about that usually white chocolate is way too sweet for me and it's also kind of boring at least most of the time and most of the makers are adding so much fun align it and it just tastes like vanilla and I'm not the biggest fan of vanilla in general and I'm especially not a big fan of artificial vanilla so I was like okay I don't really like white chocolate maybe I can make white chocolate that I like turns out it's so much harder than I expected so that's the point where I'm right now it's still way too sweet for my taste and also I'm making vegan white chocolate so I'm not using milk powder and yeah it's it's okay but I wouldn't sell it which means for me white chocolate is working progress for me so we'll see what I can come up with in the next couple of months I think yeah I'm working on that sense yeah almost since half a year or so I'm not always know all the time but now and then I'm making another batch we'll see if I can make white chocolate that I actually like okay so here's my box with all the bar wrappers of chocolate I've had before and I have two white chocolates that I really want to talk about and that's the first one that I'm not on no it's only um numb no no no I'm no I'm Charlotte from Reykjavik and they have a black and burned Valley white chocolate so it is white chocolate but it's black um unfortunately I've already ate everything so I can't show you a picture of the actual chocolate bar but it's a black chocolate and it's really really interesting and I would definitely buy this one again so yeah I would go for this white chocolate but I have another one in here that I really enjoyed this one and that's the white chocolate from Museum those are chocolate makers from Dubai and it's called a white chocolate with roasted cashew and jaggery sugar so that's a good white chocolate actually those are the only two white chocolate I really enjoy so far if you have another white chocolate I have to try leave me a comment below because I'm really interested in white chocolate because I want to make it a mound that I can't for now I need more inspiration maybe a couple of quick facts about um the history and what is actually in white chocolate the first white chocolate was invented in 1930 by Nestle that's a Swiss company I guess you've heard about it and they invented a milky bar I've never had it honestly I would try it but what it actually is white chocolate white chocolate is made of cow fat that's also called cacao butter milk solids and sugar the FDA here in the u.s. regulates white chocolate as the following white chocolate needs to has at least 20% of cacao butter 14% milk solids and 55% of sugar and not sweeter than that the difference between white milk and dark chocolate is the cacao solid content so white chocolate doesn't have any cacao solids which also means there's no caffeine or with your bromine content or antioxidant content and I think those are the points why white chocolate has a better reputation than dark chocolate it's because they lack of the antioxidants that dark chocolate has and also the high sugar content a great way to use white chocolate is definitely confections and bonbons because it doesn't taste like much but gives you a lot of sweetness it makes a great gun ash because it just doesn't bring a whole lot of taste with it your strawberries or whatever you mix them can shine there but you still have the really silky and creaminess and a great texture of chocolate as I already mentioned share with me your favorite white chocolate I would be super interested leave it in the comments follow me on instagram send me a message you can find me at chocolates peel and yeah thanks for watching my video bye", "ZHfeub5ESDE": "all right today we're gonna review the Hershey's white with whole almonds did you know that Hershey's has been around since 1894 that's a long time that's like to milk cows by hand all right so as always just like a typical Hershey's bar they've got their initials on there and there are the but there is nothing here and there's nothing in there they're like break the middle of mine yep Oh whole almonds a lot spring bite kind of bite anywhere teeth might come out [Music] unlike a typical Hershey's barb this does not taste like wax it doesn't there's no wax I like by the light chocolate person well I go that's why chocolate you like white chocolate if you like white chocolate this is absolutely like great did they did they hit the mark with the Wow white chocolate with whole almonds absolutely there's there's chunks of almonds throughout full whole almonds I think this candy bars is it's it's perfect they did exactly what they said they were gonna do I like it Hershey's but the white chocolate here is very very creamy very no it's not not like rich or anything like that are like strong but it's very it's good I usually like like dark chocolate more but honestly it depends on the chocolate is decent chocolate mm-hmm I feel like it was a higher grade brand flower she's yeah I I mean this is this is your typical regular candy bar at like Walmart I would I would honestly expect this taste to be more of like a more expensive brand of chocolate they nailed it so if you've added tell us what you thought in the comments below if you haven't had it definitely go check down there's something else you'd like us to go and do a review on tell us about it in the comments below we'll definitely check it out we have an Oreo and cookie another ice cream yeah we got ice cream to

domain and I know lots of stuff okay we will give it a try we'll see I know there's always new people coming to the channel so and and I hope it we're gonna wonder why go from kettle to table to mold instead of just from the title to the mall Rick is here now it's only 89 degrees which is just melted it's very cool it's not it's not hot or anything you know on the table I want to get it done - oh it's 82 already I'm gonna get it down to 80 180 degrees so this way I can when it's on the table then I can control picking up the chocolate on her I have more control of it I find you I could do it right out of the kettle of I really wanted to take me longer yeah because I'd have to try to get the kettle just right when using where is this way I can just keep working and then it's just faster the smaller batches in here until it's just easier to go and it's like I'm filled with temperature anyways mm-hmm they he only recently so isn't it they're not that yeah just just a year ago I think blew over a year ago [Music] you think that an almonds and cranberries pulled it down further to go doctors feel it's getting colder yep that that makes it go down fact it's far away ad and about 79 so it's ready to use now where'd she go to look pretty cool and stuff yeah it looks great what temp you doing that at Oh so many nine Wow does it run like really thin yeah what it is well you could I made a cheat sheet but then where is the sheshe thing over end of the table okay basically okay so what is Ruby chocolate it's a fourth type of chocolate you got your milk your dark in your right Ruby is number four now according to callable the creators of this it's a completely new taste and experience a gift from Mother Nature but I had to pay for it so that's not really fair Ruby Chagos made from the Ruby cocoa bean so it's a separate cocoa beans they're not adding anything to it it's an actual cocoa bean and just by selecting the right beans and using a unique processing the flavor and color tone of Ruby are unlocked so basically a but here's the ingredients cuz that's gonna come to me it's kind of like a white chocolate but white chocolate is where you you've extracted the chocolate liqueur and that's not the case here it's actually this is what how comes out after blending from the cocoa bean so sugar cocoa butter from this particular beam skim milk powder whole milk powder cocoa Mass emulsifier soy lecithin citric acid which that's not normally in chocolate so that's gonna give you a tiny bit of tartness and natural vanilla flavoring so apparently lends itself really well to berry type things so that's why we're doing dried cherries and almonds then we're gonna do one with so then we'll do one with just almonds cuz almonds all kind of have a cherry ich miss to them then we're gonna do one that's just cherries for people don't like almonds and we'll do a candy bar with dried cranberries also so we're doing four things just to try it out but apparently it's really good with berry ish type because it's kind of like a white chocolate berry notes exactly but white chocolate is made from just the cocoa butter and not using the chocolate liqueur whereas this is their this is the way it's coming out of the beans this is taking anything away from it if that makes any sense to me so it'll be interesting but this is like the new rock star of the chocolate world we'll see what happens all I gotta do is come up with some labeling on my fancy printer okay check anything else I should tell you well gun Campbell says it's a unique taste experience a premium chocolate which could be described in an intense sense saw real delight it's a tension between berry fruitiness and luscious smoothies because that's you know those are words that I would probably say it's almost like I wrote this for kalabaw yeah but they wrote it yeah I mean that's kind of like the translation for it's good yes in Terrence to terms it's good I've got a good mouthfeel okay I'll leave it to it packed full of good news and it's really healthy too mm-hmm super helpful the most healthiest it's the healthiest chocolate even healthier than dark chocolate and that's basically irresponsible not to me you're right dark chocolate and wine everybody should have some direct omelet vitamins every day dark chocolates just make really small like vitamins size piece of dark chocolate mm over there would be like the aspirin mmm don't gasp inside yeah yeah yeah that's the ticket for your help we just won't put this pub this video liners are great there's a top secret

quiet oh I was like how does it go just turn it on I never realized or moment well whilst there moved it I'm not you I can't remember that yeah you turn denying all that yeah so you try that new method you Sam yeah just pinaka what I thought I put them put them in there and I'm Phil and see if that works see all that walks yeah usually I just put it in your chocolate under here so yeah let's try it on for the heck of it see cuz I can yeah you don't even have to contact corporate let's do it yeah someone get in trouble mhm now if the corporate doesn't find this video do do dude dude because working hard or hardly work dude yeah crooked good turning up their bedroom for there's no help trying to get good help you know it's cool you had to start all over again too cold so ok 91-83 oh it that's an x-15 sorry hi I'm very updated 75 like it yeah that's it so it's just about ready hooks eight it sells out here 82 yeah it sorry 82 okay I guess we're trying on huh guess so huh [Applause] I probably should do it the other way go faster wailing that doesn't also be okay but you send that right into the chocolate first really did it this time or it's two words mr. Legrand cherries yes dried cherry still then you guys are also doing dried cranberries later on yeah she wants we're gonna try clusters almond clusters gonna try and cranberries too depend on our new Buick real cool it's cat2 well hold it right down cork then here is 92 it's good to have a under 100 yeah in the code then it only takes a couple minutes on the table would be a regular old chocolatier in no time there are some day I figure out how to do this believe in you man to teach you how to do it he is pretty good fantasy but I can't oh yes whose get your hopes up yes their cover we're covered in stuff it's high-tech miss Ruby chocolate do don't throw this is it just the lighting yeah yeah the hood the hood does that job pink things transom green it's like like chlorine and para die yeah mm-hmm makes sense yeah a new lifeguard once they pick air then it was green by the end of summer I'm pretty sure I'm trying to remember it's been like 10 15 years but it's not real yeah that's a real story I'm pretty sure it's pink stuff great yeah so there's just tons of chlorine back [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they lurk the rest that was a joke because that's not Ruby chocolate that was lime creams that fool you did know nothing gets by you huh how's that it looks man good it's just almonds these clusters no cherries or cranberries typically the making clusters at home yeah if you're doing at home have the user thermometer gun and then if you get a bowl of chocolate make sure it's under a hundred and then pony in the 90s and then you want to pour it on a little wax paper or a counter top and then when it's ready and you're mixing it up with your glove on in your hand or you could do with a spoon in there but that takes it's harder to do to regulate the right regulate that yeah dude just do on the table wax paper and stuff enough when we reaches 82 you're good to go you're gonna make clusters you can film oh and so you can do whatever you want 82 you're here first you told me on the secret yeah all secret that all the other candy makers don't even know they don't know well it's okay just we won't tell ya just don't tell anybody I said that yeah you don't need the candy industry nothing daddy yeah it's the last thing you need well he'll be here go why'd you do that tell on our secrets [Music] so this Ruby chocolates acting the same as all the other chocolates you you pour it at the same temperature mezcal this fruity the chocolate is a little fruity it's kinda nice you like it yeah that's good it's nice and white it's different difference could you're quick there's no way see those hands don't feel bad if you can't do this book as quick Steve I'm trying to hurry because we got a lot of candy to make ya got a big holiday coming busy busy busy okay so these are the cherry bars they're bumpy anyway so it's like this one yeah they gave me 703 bag they're so smooth on the top yeah so no kale yep still got complete sets to make it thin the bar obviously this pretty far that's pretty apparently it's very thingy okay well the iron's hot so keeper strike now while the iron's hot [Applause] [Applause] Oh other bar break apart pieces trim it up double checks it there's no air bubbles see any so that's what that type of one is going to look like all right kids dig in max that's your piece I'm like yeah where's the smallest one I don't start with this so it is less tada this is the dried cherry and almond rupees each and then the clusters are just all interests all murmur oh okay well that's it's cherry the dried cherry yes dry hurry up it's creamy mm-hmm I definitely like the cherry in it it's got a nice mouthfeel it's got like up then you bite into that cherry it's like I didn't get any almond in mind almonds and this no I mean it suppose to be cherry almond that's what I thought but we didn't taste much I mean or you didn't oh yeah try one that has a trunk then won't try though you just said the almond was only in the cluster yeah wait oh yeah no it's actually just sharing this one I'm because the reason I chose these ones because he made the bar slightly differently they don't cut they didn't come out that great so he's like well we'll have them taste test the ones that are like that so these are actually just cherry wow this is really soft compared a just made it yeah okay next you want to try it with almond sure no you love sweets almond flavor yeah mmm why don't you put the two together that's gonna be really good I definitely yeah yeah yeah a cherry and almond yeah I think that would be a good combination compliment each other yeah is there any almonds in that one no just cherry said just remember although well just because these ones didn't come out the best right so that's where we like one and we're not gonna sell them anyway so that's we're gonna taste testing well you could just throw them both in your mouth thank you you know okay yeah okay I do like the two together yeah yeah you said they're citric acid in it no but I didn't really get like the Tang until I got to the cherry but then it was yeah the cherry oh man series a Terp yeah I was eating them Nathan they're nice and Turkey mmm I can't wait until we bust open that pack of freeze-dried raspberry oh boy are we gonna do that though we could with standing your way plastic seal there's no way around that all right how much the final verdict it's wicked wicked creamy very easily insane explain creaminess yeah it's very rich mm-hmm the omens kind of overpowered it to me but like the cherry I thought played real nice where do you think it'd be all right with the two together yeah yeah cuz the cherry almost like I don't know it like elevates the chocolate and then it prints it oh that's what you need hmm all right good work guys thanks you too now get back to order [Music]", "xcPNV9AZhsc": "all right we're doing a food challenge white chocolate versus milk chocolate and first we're gonna switch them

down", "YjVcGXOkjWw": "[Music] good morning Leslie people YouTube welcome back to my free baking my name is Kelly and we are back here today for another hopefully delicious junk food review so this morning is going to be slightly different instead of the usual kind of chocolate bars and stuff like that today we're actually eating some breakfast together we're trying the brand-new Kellogg's white chocolate Coco Pops now there has been some major social media hype about this Kellogg's decided to do a little bit of kind of guerilla marketing by retweeting people on Twitter who were saying things like oh my god white chocolate cocoa box would be like the best oh my god imagine if white chocolate cocoa box existed so um they did it Coco Pops if you are unfamiliar with the cereal aisle of your supermarket or you are from I wit the UK Coco Pops are essentially a puffed rice cereal that are flavored with chocolate and the big kind of appeal with them is that they turn your milk chocolatey this white chocolate variety is something completely different I don't know if we have any kind of white chocolate cereals here in the UK other than perhaps the white chocolate craze so this is really exciting it's a new one from Kellogg's which we haven't had in a long time so yeah that's it so this is a brand new box at the moment I believe a white chocolate Coco Pops are only available in Asda so I looked in Sainsbury's I looked in Tesco and I couldn't find it but I did find this box for about two or three pounds in my local kind of big Asda store so as I said it's essentially a white chocolate flavoured toasted rice and it contains a 6.5 percent white chocolate so I don't know how white chocolate this is gonna taste it might just taste like vanilla I don't know there's only one way to find out you can smell that it's more than just the kind of rice cereal and you can smell that there's a bit more than vanilla in there anyway let's get it into a bowl and let's eat it now before any of you guys abuse me in the comments I you see you in with a teaspoon instead it's like a big tablespoon that might be weird I don't really care yes this is what seal looks like just tiny little grains of that puffed rice doesn't look particularly exciting but it's all about the taste just give her see you to the goal okay so we expect crunchy we expect sweet tweets that vanilla let's give it a go interesting so you know has a good crunch to it it hasn't gone kind of super saki straight as I put the milk in which is always good though I must say the most flavor you get from the cereal is when you eat it dry so I only poured the milk in one side so that I can taste it kind of dry on the other side and you get the faintest sweet white chocolate flavor in there obviously you get the taste of the toasted rice it tastes a bit like Rice Krispies but you get that kind of vanilla flavor in there you get the sweetness you get that almost cocoa butter taste that you get from kind of a cheap white chocolate it almost tastes like you've just been really really really thinly coated with white chocolate so it's definitely detectable but nothing's super strong are super sickly but that is only when the seal is dry when you eat the cereal with milk as most people probably do it kind of just tastes like a sweetened puffed rice there's nothing quite chocolaty about it I don't know if that's the flavor of the milk taking away from it I don't know if it's the cold temperature of the milk taking away from it but you definitely would not guess that this was a white chocolate cereal once the milk is in in fact I would go as far as to say that once the milk is in the cereal is actually a very bland so interesting overall I mean it's certainly nothing bad because as I said the dry cereal definitely tastes like a white chocolate cocoa pop or a white chocolate Rice Krispies even if it is very faint but I guess you also don't want anything too crazy sweet first thing in the morning because an actual bowl of white chocolate might be a little bit too much for most people but having said that it is kind of unfortunate that the flavor is pretty much non-existent too once the milk is in there because as I said I would imagine that most people when they eat cereal have this and some regular cow's milk and if the cow's milk is taking away from the flavor I can only imagine how much it diminishes if you were to use almond milk oat milk coconut milk overall I would say I'm glad that Kellogg's did this because it is kind of refreshing to have a new cereal I do love the new kind of old-school branding that they've done with these boxes and yeah it's just it's nice to have a reason to pick up something with a bit of nostalgia from your childhood I would urge you to try it if you are receiving a lover or if you just like to try new things because there's certainly nothing bad about it I'm gonna give them a four out of five if you enjoyed this review and you would like to see more kind of cereal reviews on the channel do let me know it's something I enjoy eating but I never really thought about reviewing it for you guys so if you would like to see me

ships really well so it's a really great gift to give to your friends and family so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna melt some chocolate we're gonna start with 10 ounces of bittersweet chocolate chips and I'm gonna pop this in the microwave and 30 second intervals stirring each time in between until it's fully melted once your chocolate is smooth and melted you're gonna add 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint oil stir the peppermint oil into the chocolate and once that's stirred in you're just gonna pour it your melted chocolate onto a Silpat or parchment paper and I like to smooth it out just by shaking the pan a little bit from side to side I'm gonna toss this in the freezer for about five minutes just to let the chocolate harden well the bittersweet chocolate hardens we're gonna melt our white chocolate in the exact same way in the microwave in 30 second intervals you want to make sure that you're using real white chocolate here a lot of bags are tricky they'll say white morsels or white chips and if you look at the ingredients it's not real white chocolate so just make sure that using the real stuff here my white chocolate is melted and I'm also gonna add a 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint oil to this just stir that in after the peppermint oil has been incorporated you're going to pour the white chocolate on top of the hardened bittersweet chocolate kind of spread that around with a spatula give that little bit of a shake smooth it out and before we put this in the freezer we are going to smash up some candy canes so I've got 6 ounces or 12 candy canes here that I've already unwrapped we're gonna put them into a ziplock bag I'm going to take a rolling pin I'm gonna smash these up and then you can take it smashed up candy canes and just sprinkle it all over the top this is gonna go in the freezer for another five minutes so it can harden up once your chocolate is completely hardened you can cut it into wedges or break it into shards you can take these pieces and put them a little holiday tin like this or you can take a piece of cellophane wrap place a couple of pieces in here throwing out the sides and you can just take a little piece of ribbon tie it around and you've got a really awesome add the whole gift so you can get this recipe in the description box below I hope you enjoyed this video please don't forget to subscribe like and leave a comment and I'll see you next Thursday with another video happy Holi [Music] [Music]", "Hy8CpGTWYCU": "welcome to Matt Riley bakes today's recipe is white chocolate and raspberries Blondie's a blondie is a brownies paler cousin took me to the fire station the other day and two of the bloke said it's the best thing they've ever eaten now there is an endorsement for you they're not wrong you start off with I've got my golden caster sugar in a bowl I'm gonna beat four eggs into that beat your eggs and sugar together til they're light and fluffy then add your melted butter in stages once you're happy they're fully combined it's time to gently fold in your flour you're roughly chopped white chocolate when that's done pour it into your lined baking tray I've rubbed some fat around - and a parchment paper and it helps the parchment paper stick so it's always worth doing gently move the white chocolate pieces around so they're evenly distributed in the mix I'm also made these with fresh raspberries - mine you don't have to check it this bait to pop the steering which came out today now I'm going to leave it in his team to call complete finisher Blondie's off with a drizzle of melt with white chocolate and a sprinkling of free driver so there we go my white chocolate and raspberry Blondie's I hope you enjoy making them thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe to Matt Reilly banks", "Yi3Vus1lZ7g": "today Kevin and I have three graders a candy bars to try for you now you know that a lot of you know this a graters is an ice cream it's a brand of ice cream and we actually did a couple of videos where we went in there and we tried the ice cream truck ice cream at home so Kevin I've seen those videos you might want to watch those but while we were in there loving toward their little shop they had these candy bars in there and I think there were like five a total that dark chocolate and something else but they were $2.99 each so I just bought three because I figured nine dollars is a lot of money for candy bars this one is just the regular milk chocolate bar this is milk chocolate with crispy rice and this is the milk chocolate with almonds we're gonna try the regular milk chocolate first and it says handcrafting irresistible ice cream since 1870 one-third of the bar is under 80 calories per pill slot out nope must be okay never know how they rappers are like and this is a manufactured for brighter so no time to actually oh okay so yeah it doesn't even have graders or written on the bar it's just just has a design on the front and then the back is just plain but for some summer rates do you think I did that's guitar either he remind you the world's famous talking about world's finest holds bonds that is going to give us an all they feel to it it does but it's really it's very good sex was very creepy you don't realize how good it is until you really get it all over your tongue and to me it's really very very good that would be good if you could melt it somehow and dip like pretzels hey this one's with the Rice Krispies basic on the top what's the same at the bottom the bottom is where it looks different that's good mm-hmm Dig Dug the exact same chocolate it has yeah it just has that crisped rice in up it is I think better than a Nestle Crunch Bars yes the the chocolate is just it's better quality than your age brunch and I love the pieces of the Chris Bryce good question normally that's not a candy bar I gravitate towards but now that's that's very very essence also a little thicker that it is and this one's with some chocolate on it when I'm back when I was a kid and I was I've Hershey Gaynor I don't even got her skin tumors anymore but when I was a kid and aged about Hershey candy bars I would buy the ones of all those now there's just too many other pending bars that are really good that thought about her she bloody gory good you lost your honor it has a strong almond flavor that's good like almonds oh it is good yes honestly shockingly I would even though it's good I would not get that one again because the almond is so strong going to enjoy the chocolate mm-hmm the chocolate on its own is such a good flavor that you you that just takes over you know and you don't you don't need that much on well I like both of these I think I probably just buy the regular milk chocolate sake however Romanus that was 180 for a third and the almonds is 195 this was the crispy is the cereals one set about the same yeah out of all of them I think I would choose the milk chocolate them too just because it has a really good flavor you can let it melt on your tongue and this would last you well so how far all I'm impressed with all three of those Roy don't know very very good yeah I don't you know you ain't paying - nothing on for a candy bar but if you divvy it out and it lasts you for three servings then it was worth your three dollars so I hope you enjoyed the video I will have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "DzC6XThkVrI": "okay so dark chocolate break that up you need 185 grams of that individual turn up to medium-high melt chop up butter into small cubes pour that into the pan with your dark chocolate so you want to cook this until it's all melted now that's all covered we need to wrap this bowl in cling film instead of doing it in the pan you can always put it in the microwave for two minutes with clean film covering the whole bowl loosely you want to call this at room temperature until it's cooled down get a 20 centimeter tray and line it with parchment paper so we need to tip our flour into there and your 40 grams of cocoa powder you want to chop your white chocolate and your milk chocolate now that that's finely chopped chip in three eggs and 275 grams of caster sugar whisk until light and fluffy now that that is all mixed we get our chocolate mixture from before and we pour that in with the mousse we need to fold that with a spatula now right now that we've done that we pour this in to our coconut flour mixture nicely done so what we need to do is we need to gently fold this in using the same figure eight action as before it might look dry and dusty at first but trust me it won't be because if you go very gently and very quiet and very softly it will end up looking fudgy so we grab our chunks from before and tuck that in now we're going to mix this in looks lovely i'll be putting a link to everything in the description and also possibly a link to the recipe in the description i'll pour this in and for an extra surprise we're gonna put some crunchy rocks in there oh wow look at that let's move it over for extra surprise put your mixture on a baking tray chuck in the oven bake that for 25 minutes bake until done has just gone off so time to take out the oven with kitty mitts meow since this isn't fully cooked yet we're gonna go back in the oven for another five minutes five minutes starting now pour onto a cooling rack and cool that's cooled trim the edges and cut into slices chocolaty yum yum thank you for watching i hope that you can make these brownies at home for yourself as well i will

giselle today i have for you guys another teddy bear video but today's video is also going to have our six strawberries i can't wait to show you guys and today's theme is going to be yellow sunflowers let's go ahead and get started so right here we have our three part teddy bear mold it has a front piece middle piece and back piece as well super easy to work with next up i have already pre-melted my melting wafers this is using the brand ghirardelli and this is a consistency you should be working with it is super great right over here have my chef master candy coloring in the color yellow remember guys always make sure it is oil based right over here i have my toothpicks with my six strawberries and right here i have my piece of wax paper with a little bit of support here at the bottom so we're going to start off with coloring our melting wafers so i have already given this a really good shake now i want this to be like a light pastel yellow so i'm going to add one to two drops and we'll be right back [Music] so in total i went ahead and added seven drops of my yellow candy coloring and i achieved this really beautiful pastel yellow now all we're going to do is just add it into our bare mold so we want to get the front piece of this set so i just have this one ready right here now there is a line right here um i don't think you guys can see it but it is right here and we're just going to fill it up to that line so let's go ahead and do that so i'm just simply going to pour over it and we're going to go up to the line and then we're just going to bring it down and fill up the belly as well now from here i'm going to level it off and see if it's right up to the line and i see that it is perfectly up to the line so now i'm just going to tap it off a little bit not too hard now from here we're going to grab our flexible middle piece and just add this right here in the center now with your two fingers we're just going to press down just a little bit now we're going to let this one do the rest of the job so we're going to place it in the back press it down a little bit then we're going to flip it over and just press down and the entire bear just want to make sure everything is nice and covered so now that our bear is completely covered with our chocolate now we're just going to place this into the freezer for 15 minutes and we'll be right back now in the meantime we're gonna dip our six strawberries now all of these are going to be colored in our yellow candy melts so let's go ahead and do that we're just gonna grab a toothpick and you guys already know you guys are gonna place your toothpick on the right hand side of your berry then after that go ahead and pick up all of the stems so that they're out of the way and directly from here also make sure it's dry and we're just going to dip it into our yellow candy melts so just dip it inside i like to bring mine not too much all the way up now from here we're just going to lift it up and shake off the excess now if you have any air bubbles you can go ahead and pop those with a little toothpick and then from here i just want to lift it up give it a little wiggle now it should be nice and evenly coated just like this now i'm going to place this over here on my wax paper and i'm going to repeat the same process and we'll be right back now that we're done prepping our teddy bear now we're on to decoration today we will be using poppy paint this works perfectly on chocolate and it is 100 edible now the important thing about this is you always want to make sure you shake it well so i have already done this to both of mine i will be using white and this kind of like gold color here today and also another thing to know is you want to work with a little bit at a time you don't want to add too much poppy paint because they will dry out really fast so in the meantime we're just going to start off with just a little bit and today we're going to draw these really beautiful flowers so i'm just going to add a little bit to it and i'll add more as i go [Music] and from here i have this wilton brush so we just want a little bit of product on the brush and from here we're just going to draw these right here i'll go ahead and also insert a picture for you guys now i'm just going to draw these all around and we'll be right back do [Music] do so we're all done with our finished bear it looks super adorable and i just went ahead and finished it off with the cute little bow right here i just used ribbon and i absolutely love how it turned out now next up we're going to hop onto our strawberries now to our strawberries on all of them i'm going to add in sterling pearl in the color super pearl now from here we're just going to grab a little brush you want to add a little bit and now we're just going to swirl it all around so right now i don't know how i'm gonna decorate them but i'm just gonna play around with different things and i'll show you guys a process as i'm doing it now we're on to packaging we're already done with everything now to this one there's going to be a little trick to putting it into our box because i know it is difficult for us to just place it on there with all the candy just right here um so this is a really good hack you're gonna flip over your bear now from here you're gonna fill it up all the way up with candy so i'm just gonna add like random candy inside [Music] [Music] now basically you just want to make sure everything is nice and you know leveled down now from here we're going to grab our bear and then you can also grab this box right here and you're going to flip the box over and then you're going to bring it down so it's going to look like this in our box now this ensures that you have all of your candy underneath and you're not going to have any trouble placing it inside later and i'll also show you guys the designs i made today so this one is our beautiful sunflower i just added the stripe right here on the left hand side to this one i just added this little swirl all the way down on the other side and lastly to this one right here i just added three little pearls with chocolate lastly just to tie this all together i went ahead and grabbed my sterling pearl this one is in fairy also 100 edible from the sugar art i added it into my own little like spray bottle i found this spray bottle on amazon i'll go ahead and link it below and to this one i'm just going to spray all my berries to get that super shiny effect and that just gives you like such a beautiful effect at the end of preparing all of your berries so this is the end of the video i really hope you guys enjoyed if you did feel free to give me a big thumbs up subscribe to my channel and turn on those post notifications to notify you the

heat add some butter and mix carefully then pouring the heavy cream and mix set aside and let the camera cool down let's get the very first ready take the chocolate base out of the fridge and remove it from the mold will need reversed which a six and a half centimeters long exactly that's right cut the excess parts off we need to do this in order to leave one centimeter so spaced on each side now it's time to assemble the bar diksa can hash out of the fridge and cover the chocolate base with a thin layer wait leave in one centimeter space on each side put a layer of wafers on top and slightly press them in the same way make two more layers cover the first layer with ganache then a layer of wafers on top then again the ganache and wafers if you want you can put it into the fridge for 30 minutes or until the ganache is dead prove the cold care move into the puffs rice and mix well until everything is covered with caramel put the caramel mixture on the top of the vapors slightly spill some vegetable oil on your hand and spread the caramel mixture in Li put the bar into the fridge for 30 minutes in a medium bowl combine the chopped milk and dark chocolate melted in the microwave

the bar slightly tabs a based on the glasses in order to latex is chocolate trickled down let it stand for one minute put the bar onto a big plate and put into the fridge until the chocolate is set we did it so let's compare cut a small piece Wow they are absolutely identical thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it please give some that subscribe and share it", "e6KJGN3yet0": "[Music] welcome back to another video what are we checking in today we're checking instant chocolate this one goes into my Bulgarian bunny today for iliyan we're checking a white chocolate from the excellence line from lint this is the vanilla white chocolate typically when they see on a label like vanilla and white it's actually just like palm oil flavored vanilla and makes you appear like white chocolate but this one actually specifically says white chocolate so it does have to require to man cocoa butter to officially call it white chocolate which is a good thing lint makes excellent products so I don't expect anything less from then let's look at nutrition facts plus this guy open and take a taste so for three squares the 30 grams I've got 170 calories 11 grams of fat 17 grams of carbs zero hyper 17 sugar and 2 grams of protein this is how the bar comes in the package and this is what the bar looks like we got some delicious looking milk chocolate nicely labeled by Lind as you can tell there's actually little spots this actually shows that it is a quality white chocolate typically a dark chocolate guy I do like white chocolate but I never haven't enough I'm looking really forward to this one who can resist a good piece of white chocolate let's cut off a piece but I'm expecting it to be creamy sweet but I'm wondering either that vanilla taste let's see what it's like that's good first thing I will note it's not like mass-produced white chocolate like it is sweet and you can tell it's rich but typically you run the mill white chocolate that you buy it's a just like a normal white chocolate candy bear it's like sugar hits you instantly this one takes a few minutes and the texture when you pop it in your mouth it is just oh it's so hard to explain you definitely get that white chocolate taste and then like a little bit of a follow up there after is that vanilla taste it is really nice guys really nice what does Ron think of Lindt excellence vanilla white chocolate he likes it he's given this an 8.5 out of 10 I don't find it so much in your face as you're typically mass-produced white chocolate it is really nice really great and you can tell it's indulgent this has been a quick look at lint excellence vanilla white he moistu out good and cookie dough then another round reviews then see you next time I'm dreaming of someone chocolate you", "BbGUqcvZZ5s": "what's going on guys Bobby with consumer time capsule back with another review for you here and today we are back outdoors with a cove in nineteen safe review here at the garage not at the treehouse I wish we were and maybe by the end of the day today we'll be at the treehouse I don't know but anyway we got three new candies to cover here this is the closest thing to a lightning round we're gonna have for a while so we've got the birthday cake Kit Kats M&Ms fudge brownie and cookies and chocolate hershey illega cookies and cream but with a regular Hershey bar so as part of their a continual boy we get bugs on here these outdoor reviews I don't know about that I as part of their continuing series of new flavors you know we had the KitKat duo's that were a major hit the tail end to last year we've got these and then we had the lemon crisp Kit Kats are really good the raspberry and cream maybe a little less so but yeah we've got now birthday cake so nice confetti pieces with some white fudge what do you think you love I love it's like the little the little balls that go on the cupcakes you know what I mean for the for the jimmies Oh ma'am yes yes plus it tastes like the mother's the mother's animal cookies it really does mean these are amazing Brian I need more I will leave I'll leave alone control of these thank you but I wow really really good 88 cents at Walmart they're getting pretty easy to find just about everywhere now so you should be able to find them at you know like a Walgreens Target CVS really really solid man KitKat just keep coming up with new flavors it sounds like they're gonna continue doing that doing that this year too unless this whole corona virus and a makes those plans knowin void but man I can tell I can tell what you things get away all right we can't declare any winners yet because we still have these fudge brownie M&Ms so these I found at Walgreens for 79 cents I they they were actually leaked on Instagram is like product coming out like nine months ago and I was like kind of starting to lose hope that they were ever coming and then they did so it's a regular chocolate mmm and inside you have pieces of what is purported to be fudge brownie so just grab a grab a handful those are in the fudge brownie is the middle so there is a a regular milk chocolate mm surrounding it kind of like what you would see with a peanut M&M or something and then inside is got fudge fudge brownie apparently that sounds like a difficult flavor to communicate in mmm does it not you're good he's pretty fudgy yeah it's got a little chewiness to it then I like again a little bit more chew out of that usually it like disappears kind of granularly and this time takes an extra few bites definitely what's different textural elements to it the fudge taste is like a fudge pop what are those fudge pop with a bunch pops it's a you're talking about like a Fudgsicle fudgesicle yeah it's a little bit like that it's G chocolaty I know it's I don't like it I like it throw them in my glove Corona style there you go thank you melts in your mouth down your hand not in your glove this Texas heat is getting to these Hershey bars which are all always melting anyway right so the back looks very very similar to what you'd see in a traditional cookies and cream bar I didn't actually show you the package but here's the cookies and chocolate I've only been able to confirm that these are available at Walmart right now which means that they're going to be in a king-sized bar not a conventionally sized bar a dollar and 48 cents so I see look at it's like like jelly great texture though he's got that Hershey throat it does it you know I know that this tends to not be a popular opinion when I constantly share it Hershey bars suck like why does anybody like them I don't know look if it's not a nostalgia thing why would you eat a Hershey bar now that said that's it I want to be very clear very very very clear I love the cookies and cream bar you combo that with a bush that's one of the best things that you can have like that's that is the ultimate treat and this is part cookies and cream bar which it is far inferior to in part Hershey bar which it's a little better than because you get the textural element that you usually wouldn't very chocolaty we got two entries here that are very chocolatey and one that is absolutely the direct polar opposite of it and I get to tell you I think that the Hershey bar is probably third place yeah do you agree okay so we'll do the capsule countdown before we get into the gimmicks because I feel like the capsule countdown it's gonna be pretty easy here third place go into the cookies in chocolate a little bit too chocolatey and really it's got a disadvantage in that it is so unbelievably melty that I'm really tasting it at its worst I feel like you give this you know quick 45 minutes to an hour in a freezer and it probably tastes alright but I'll give it a 4 out of 10 good texture but taste just nothing special fudge brownie M&Ms getting second place on today's capsule countdown I like the chewiness I think it's a little bit too much of an assault in terms of chocolate enos like I like like the crispy M&Ms I like the peanut M&Ms I like the almond M&Ms like the peanut butter M&Ms because it it kind of is a second flavor to complement the mms whereas this is really even more chocolaty than a regular milk chocolate mmm so I give it a five and a half out of ten mostly for the texture second-place on today's capsule countdown the winner Ryan you would have probably physically assaulted me if I wouldn't have said this the winner is definitely birthday cake KitKat Coquet has won a lot of capsule countdowns this year remember the lemon Crisp KitKat was the best Easter themed product of the year on our lightning round this is a really a good a good sign of things to come I really think this is one of the strongest flavors of Kit Kats yet texturally unbelievable actually all three of these really unbelievably great texture but this one in terms of taste one of the best white chocolate candies ever made and I don't think that can even be argued because most white chocolate candy kind of sucks I'll give it a 9 out of 10 first place on today's capsule countdown as far as the gimmick grades go quickly we have 5 out of 10 for the cookies and chocolate for kind of expanding the line of cookies and cream bars I'll also give it a 5 out of 10 to the fudge brownie M&Ms you wouldn't think to fill an mm with a brownie but at the same time I you know it's gonna give a 6 out of 10 why not get bump it up a little bit birthday cake KitKat that's a great idea I'll give it an eight and a half out of ten and a high ischemic rate of the day as well so definitely a product to be reckoned with you want to throw in the head a little bit let's throw a nine at it okay so 9 out of 10 for the birthday cake Kit Kats about the best-tasting in most interesting product of the day what is that an 18 total product score pretty pretty strong and as promised even though it's the CTC review since we're not doing lightning rounds temporarily I'll show you a classic product from the archives not going to be a candy this time we're missing our fast food Ryan and I it's been a while since we've been able to film one so I'm going to show you a steak knife from McDonald's so in 1980 I McDonald's had the chopped beef steak sandwich and they actually gave away steak knives with like a little coupon that you'd get with your with your sandwich so it's it's just a regular steak knife you can see this is like the one that everybody's grandparents had they might have come from McDonald's so it says collective full set I only have the one but it is factory sealed and I don't foresee myself unsealing it anytime soon if you're interested in one of these I got it for like six or seven dollars total on eBay including shipping so you should collect a set of Stephanie Tunnel steak knives and report back we're missing our fast food I hope that McDonald's is doing well out there but certainly we're doing well you know enjoying our new settings of our CTC reviews and I hope you guys are enjoying CTC commercial archives Tuesday through Friday and of course next Monday we'll be back with another CTC review I think it's Tara masu Oreos I think it's what we're gonna be doing so see how that stacks up and of course until next time stay safe and I will miss you until I see you I guess we're pushing on reviews now it's what we do so Cheers", "v6gmCIaCkNo": "hey everyone it is really great to have you back here today we are going to talk about particle size a lot of first time or soon-to-be chocolate makers don't seem to grasp the reason they need a melange or a refiner they don't really get why superfine sugar can't just be stirred into chocolate liquor its superfine after all the problem here is that superfine is a qualitative assessment what is superfine what you need is a quantitative assessment basically you need a number it's often said that chocolate should have a particle size between 15 and 25 microns but what does that really mean do you even know what a micron is on this side of the pond we mostly deal in inches by definition a micron though is one one thousandth of a millimeter this is a millimeter it's about 125th of an inch a micron is about zero point zero zero zero zero three nine three seven inches to use a qualitative term that's really tiny but how tiny is it look at this crystal of granulated sugar it's about 500 microns or you know half a millimeter superfine powdered sugars about one-fifth that or 100 microns but as you can see I can't even show that to you we still have to get ten times smaller than that what that means is its analogy time so let's pretend this rock is a crystal of granulated sugar and this one is a crystal of our superfine powdered sugar that's as fine as you can get without refining in a m\u00e9lange er after about 12 hours in the melange are the sugar crystals have refined down to about 50 microns and your tongue amazing as it is still can detect that there's a little bit of grit but you've left the crunch zone when we're finally down to refined chocolate we're down to about 15 microns at this size you don't feel it anymore in your mouth I think it's really important to restate what we're doing here our goal is to make chocolate that's pleasurable to eat if your chocolates 500 microns then it's not going to be pleasurable at 10 microns it's probably is going to be but is it going to be any more so than 14 microns probably not don't get fixated on a number the important part is to understand what the role of refining has in making your

first time I don't like my outfit second time my bid is just looking a bit out of control so I'm just going to shave for you guys so if I like some serious commitment for about the 20 of you probably going to watch this video anyway I'm going to show you how I made this strawberry and white chocolate loaded cake I think that's the official name wanna get this cake I entered the peak in a baking competition in my home town I got second place about quite pretty cool a professional photographer she took some pictures of my cake so I'll put them on screen now like I think they look pretty sick and I'm pretty happy with them I'm supposed run right into this video because my goal is to do a cake tutorial in under 8 minutes so we'll see if we can do it [Music] so to meet this cake strawberryish I actually made some strawberries blunders and I did that by just mixing some strawberry going into my vanilla cake butter and I did two of them in a darker shade of pink for me of one and does that because I'm going to do sort of a checkerboard effect I'm going to show you how I did this so after I've leveled off my cake I then go in there with a cookie for sir in each of the cakes and then I use the bottom of a six inch panel around that around the cake and I've got three disks of each one of those sponges and kind of interchange those into different into V in into each of the rings and that's what's going to give us that checkerboard effect it might not look like it's going to do that but it well trust me after I've done all that messing about with my sponges I've been sugar syrup then with some strawberries sugar syrup just to serve infuse that kind of strawberry flavor into my sponges though then attach my first layer of cake onto a 10 inch cake board with that Swiss meringue buttercream these are eight inch cakes by the way I played with my sis fungal cream some white chocolate and some strawberry puree so then do a big blob part but cream on top of that first layer and I spread that round with a palette I've just so it's nice to the edges and nice and smooth and even but I thought my next layer on top repeat that process might keep doing that until I get to the top of the cake I've been to a similar of but cream all around my cake are much called the crumb coat and that keeps in all of the crumbs and on your inner Montford layers an effectual final layer of frosting anthro from that crumb coat I then put it straight in the fridge just to cool down so it's all nice and set so after this 30 minutes are up I vented my cake up to my final layer so I generally put on lots of book cream on my gate with my palette knife as I smooth out with a cake scraper I finally have a cake scraper but quite cool so that would have been handy in my last video for em yeah I bought this mount it pretty good the doing what I need it to do I then plate event colored some butt cream red and pink and I have randomly puttin up a run here and then I use my cakes move it just move it round give that kind of watercolor effect now using this cake comb and I need for spot will be speaking in virtually because I've got a really really good deal with Amazon so along with this big cake spray files they've got all of these cake aims and some of them are double-sided so yeah I got all of the peak home for just click it was like 550 so I'll leave the link in the description box below where I got all of these that's really good deal like I'm not sponsored I just want you all to get a really good deal because this was pretty good certainly going in with this will be custom them all now going in with this cake comb I'm going to go around the cake and that summit if I take a really nice kind of texture as you can see in the video I saw something that I then put some white whipped cream in a piping bag with a star Noble and I'm kind of doing like a funky sort of see around the top of the cake and it's really helped me to a point harm poisonous bit kind of and I've done a quote this will hopefully give you really good idea but it's kind of feeling like a comb and they're going around so it's just like a ALDC all around the cake just surfy with a nice sort of border at the top and then I'm going to do a border around the bottom kind of like beads of buttercream with a small bomb or you can buy a pile of oppression and pull away a little pressure pull away little bit pressure and pull it away and that's how I sort of keep us we did kind of border around my cake then I'm going to move on to being my favorite part that great cakes and that is actually decorating the cake 30 decorated if I was actually very adventurous I got some tempered white chocolate and I put that over a sheet of acetate and then using this cake home and I will flip that through just put some line through that it's liquid some scissors so I have three sheets effectively then using a glitter so you can front of your house obviously I got this brand new cold spot acetate sheet with white chocolate and I put place it in there so it kept it safe now put that in the fridge for about five minutes and after is like when if I peeled our and then I've got this really funky funky funky funky monthly goes I'm really really impressed with our splatter I want to see us like I'm not a chocolatier to any extent whatsoever so was really a master fun times good fun part on the backs of that one but I've also got some white clip dipped strawberries I also have some meringue kisses or crying but like a mom's very sort of pink effect going on there I also have this strawberries and Korean part sheet macaroons and if you want to hire meet them we check out the link right here I think I want to put a kiss I think it appears here I think so I wanted kind of come up in that sort of sassy of the cake I put a straw the Cochran's planning on doing a sort of a marker for myself so I put that in there and then I go around those strawberries dipped in white chocolate but run the top of the cake on that board but I'm just making it a loaded cake and how I feel everyone just cooking everything on that I didn't I don't necessarily do that for EM yeah there's no strategic ways medium s I am just putting on the macaroons the meringue the strawberries the white chocolate curl and just randomly on them on there and sort of moving it around making sure it looks kind of like an intentional pretty mass that's what I'm gonna go for to ask them pursue the Commerce of Cairo on the mountain top of the cake I then start to do like sort of flashes of the cake I would recommend you put a little bit of white chocolate on there on the bottom on your meringue macaroons and strawberries as you're going up this a [Music] if you liked this video give it a thumbs up

the review is going to be the mile-high mint milk chocolate pink edible by the company medically correct and the product line from what I could glean from their website which I will put in the description below is the incredibles line there's several different bars that you can get in that line I'm going to try some of those in the future so as you can see it's already opened and I'm kind of doing a retro review here because I have taken a couple doses of this already but I wanted to go through the whole process with you on this review so you're not gonna get any unwrapping unboxing excitement here but you have a little tear tab here you rip it open and it's a foil foil pack it's really nicely professionally packed and what you get is it kind of looks like a KitKat you can't really see with the light but it there's three different pieces and there's three different bars and it's interesting from the dosage it says this take one bar one for high dosage patients take one bar every four hours if I did that I I wouldn't get up after the first one I'd be sleeping all day long so I've already taken two doses of this with the piece that I have and what's taken here so tonight we're going to take about let's see a ninth of it is what it kind of translates into a little handful here that should be about a ninth of it so I will munch that up and let you know what it tastes like first thing you notice when you pull it out of the package is a really strong mint concentration this they've really loaded it up and I'm pretty sure they did that to mask the THC twang that kind of nasty taste that the cannabis adds to the food that's one thing about cannabis it isn't so great as it doesn't taste very good I'm gonna get a glass of water just sec alright got a little bit of water to rinse my palate since I'm such a well renowned gourmand I can't go and Canon gourmand I don't know what you'd call it but again the taste is pretty dang good what other benefits does this have that I can determine before I actually see the effects expiration date on this I noticed is like two years which is really great that if you buy something you don't want to eat it all right away you can throw it in the freezer and probably wait at least a year and it'll still be just as efficacious take value this has a hundred and seventy-five milligrams of THC you can see it in that little green splash up in the center a little bit and this was a ten dollar purchase and so if you use my milligrams per dollar scale that translates to seventeen point five milligrams per dollar that's a really high rating from other edibles that I've eaten and another interesting thing when I was looking at this I got a read you the disclaimer on the back of this I've kind of liked it levels of active components of medical marijuana reported on product labels are not subject to independent verification and may different differ from actual levels there's the weasel they don't really know exactly how much is in here and this product is infused with medical marijuana and was produced without regulatory oversight for health safety or efficacy and there may be health risks associated with the consumption of the product dot dot or it may just or it may be saving your life I don't think it's just that's a little bit hyperbole but this is kind of an interesting little disclaimer I read on this again this company is medically correct I will include their the URL down in the description so I am signing off for now to assess the most important criteria pain relief and how any side effects may arise I'll take some notes and make it back to you it's a dirty job but someone's got to do it all right it's the next day I've just come back to the computer to do my assessment of the mile high milk chocolate bar also known as the Hershey bar from hell and I'm gonna we're gonna see how it holds up under the rigorous withering scrutiny of the ganja geezer all right based on my 4-point system for rating number one is taste I rate this an 8 out of 10 the combination of milk chocolate and strong men easily masks the THC funk that's present and Homa you know all edibles that I've had so far and again your mileage may vary I'm a big fan of milk chocolate and mint so that was a plus for me pain relief I'm gonna rate that uh no eight out of ten very good pain relief pain down the left leg completely was pushed into the background mild nagging pain stolen the lower back but easily manageable number three was side effects when my reading the side effects I'm gonna rate it a seven out of ten very manageable light high with calming effects and I was fairly easily able to comport myself in public at least I think so went for a walk and I felt great during it final rating is the milligrams per dollar rating and as we as I discussed earlier it's 175 milligrams in a $10 bar so easily I'll move the decimal one place and it comes up to seventeen point five milligrams per dollar which is the best non sale or non buy one get one price I found so far so I give that were rating a nine out of ten you add them all up the eight eight to seven and a nine and you get an average of an overall rating of eight eight out of ten for the month mile-high mint milk chocolate bar are you pretty impressed with my Photoshop food air of putting that number over the pot leaf that was a lot of

insanely requested by you all I am going to try what is known here in Australia as the Tim Tam slam now if you're not familiar with what a Tim Tam it is is amazing biscuit that is like mousse filled or has any sort of feeling really and dipped in chocolate and it's like pretty good quality chocolate too so they are definitely one of my favorite sweets that you can buy commercially here in Australia now a Tim Tam slam is where you take your actual Tim cam and use it as a straw apparently and I'm really excited to try this some of you guys recommended that I try it with coffee hot cocoa with just regular milk I am going to try it with the way I take my coffee always is americano no sugar no milk and also I'm going to try something a little bit different please don't judge me too harshly on this but white chocolate and matcha green tea is a phenomenal pairing in the dessert world especially in Japan it's one of my favorite flavor combinations so I'm going to take my favorite flavour Tim Tam which is white chocolate and I'm going to try the Tim Tam slam drinking just matcha green tea I also take my matcha unsweetened but whatever your preference is is let me know and if you guys have done this in the past or you try this for the first time please let me know in the comments below what kind of Tim Tams you use what kind of beverage is used and we're gonna have some fun okay so I have my milk chocolate Tim Tam and I have my coffee okay so we have to bite the ends off first and I hope I'm not making a mess here umm why am i holding this like I'm about to spark up for the first time alright so I have my coffee and I'm gonna try to do this as gracefully as possible okay I could not see how I looked I hope I didn't look like a cheap bimbo doing that but that was awesome I'm like so excited to try another one I'm gonna try it like oh my god that was really awesome I can totally see why you guys love that so much but it's crazy cuz like the biscuit disintegrate so quickly so it's like how much can you get in before it goes away and it's like really really fun it may be gluttonous I'm sorry if I have stuff on my mouth it may be gluttonous but usually in videos I don't eat the extras because I do kind of a lot of these videos or I'm trying snacks and stuff I just like take by or not swallow it I can't do that with Tim Tims like I can't not do Tim to have videos often you guys cuz I will just like blow up like a Zeppelin okay so once again I'm gonna eat the ends off and let me know if I'm doing it like too much I'm trying to like not take off a lot but okay so here I go it doesn't melt and I can just go all day with us and I anything I'm not a huge milk thin oh my god I gotta try it one more time in case I didn't get the angle that I needed for this video song you Tim Tims like from milk are so amazing you guys have no idea like I have been so looking forward to filming this video because I knew I was gonna eat Tim Tams so last but not least we are gonna try the matcha green tea and the white chocolate in my mind my fat girl voice is like you should try the white chocolate with coffee in the milk it's like okay alright so we're gonna try the matcha in the white chocolate and see how that works I'm thinking it's gonna be fantastic I should try it with a milk chocolate to only because matcha and milk chocolate do go well together a lot of Japanese snacks are milk chocolate or white chocolate basements I'll stop okay I'm I'm so excited for this because it's my favorite combination and oh my god alright yeah I smell so that I love white chocolate but it has to be good white chocolate it can't be like the compound stuff I don't know if this is gonna take it's just good I don't know they probably have like meth or something in there it's just it's great all that mousse inside or whatever it is that feeling alright we're gonna try it with the matcha green tea now and once again I'm sorry if this looks so like not graceful you guys need to try that oh my god that is awesome I don't know what to do should I drink the tea eat it what do I do I'm like so overwhelmed and please use premia and matcha tea don't use the shitty stuff from China that's like army camel green like all that is is green tea that doesn't process similar to much or matcha has been picked at a specific time of year in season which is usually rainy days during the spring and then it's nice and bright green and vibrant anyways I'll shut up I got to eat my sucky matcha Tim Tam okay jets for a super bonus I'm going to try the white chocolate one with the milk only because I know you guys want to see it so much can't really taste the white chocolate oh well my blood Sugar's gonna be higher than I would be if I were sparking up a  jail for the first time all right last one because I can't all right so here we go we're gonna try the milk chocolate with the matcha green tea my glasses are all like hella foggy um I didn't like it so anyways you guys thank you so much for recommending that I try this I had a lot of fun it was definitely like a super awesome life experience for me I cannot buy Tim Tams often because I have literally no self-control when it comes to them they're awesome I think if you are here in Australia and you have loved ones overseas like please send them home like especially those of you who are expats they will love them like your family all of them these are absolutely something that I would miss if I weren't in Australia so with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you once again for the recommendations if you have any other recommendations for things for me to try let me know in the comments below and I'll see you next video love you guys", "mVbXYXs32f0": "[Music] [Laughter] 'we chokolate is a chocolate derivative it commonly consists of cocoa butter sugar and milk solids and is characterized by a pale yellow or ivory appearance the melting point of cocoa butter its primary cocoa bean component is high enough to keep white chocolate fallen at room temperature whey chocolate is chocolate that does not contain nonfat cocoa solids the primary nutritional constituent of chocolate liquor chocolate in its raw unsweetened form during the manufacturing process the dark-colored solids of the cocoa bean are separated from its fatty content as with milk semi-sweet and dark chocolate but unlike those others chocolate types the cocoa solids are not recombined as a result this fat cocoa butter is the only cacao ingredient in white chocolate because it contains no cocoa solids white chocolate contains only trace amounts of the stimulants theobromine and caffeine while lacking the antioxidant properties or many characterizing ingredients of chocolate such as thiamine riboflavin and phenyl ethyl amine often the cocoa butter is deodorized to remove its strong flavor if prime press cocoa butter is used it has natural antioxidant vitamin E but if deodorized it has none as the deodorizing is a steam stripping step often at 180 degrees Celsius 356 degrees Fahrenheit whey chocolate may include additional flavorings vanilla is a common additive some preparations known as confectioner's coating or solar coating may be confused with white chocolate but are made from an expensive solid or hydrogenated vegetable and animal fats and are not at all derived from cocoa these preparations may actually be white in contrast to white chocolates ivory shade and Voula cocoa butters flavor regulations govern what may be marketed as white chocolate in the United States since 2004 white chocolate must be by weight at least 20% cocoa butter 14 percent total milk solids and 3.5 percent milk fat and no more than 55 percent sugar or other sweeteners

good old time and uh i'm gonna have a daggam good time okay", "1TsZkzrhQLM": "is thank you", "yiL-CssmjPY": "hi guys welcome back to at home with Yves today I'm going to help you make a Halloween fridge cake [Music] first break up your chocolate into pieces so it melts easily as well as measuring it out he obviously likes the sound of the snapping of the chocolate so this is dark chocolate and knew I wanted out in one hand looking always fit this bit coffee like isn't it's quite strong [Music] [Music] so 250 grams meant I have to eat half a biscuit it's pretty big I don't have big enough so I'm gonna have to do some short sandwich bags but what you need to do its smush the biscuits up not so it's a fine powder so there's a few chunks of biscuits that's not bigger than a crouton I would say the Biscay 15 I put them into individual bags I'm never going to use this you just make a little noise [Music] although you don't have to put anything in the oven this is the thing you need to be very patient with if you try and do this quickly your chocolate will I don't know what the word is curdle or it just gets too stodgy and not running to be happy very very patient I've bought the kettle and we'll put some water underneath here and then while it's simmering not boiling because that will that that's will make it go wrong the bowl on top like this and then the chocolate and butter in here and slowly stir that so I'm just lining it before putting the chocolate in it just gives you that extra security and make sure always check just quickly carefully not to burn yourself check that it's not boiling and now you've got in the golden syrup while this is continuing to melt very sticky stuff so I just removed it and the chocolate from heat and as you can see there are some slight lumps and bumps but you never watched it leave it too long and then it will start going granule II and then not like a shiny melty chocolate the next thing to do is to stir in the biscuits that you've already smashed and your raisins [Music] and then what I tend to do is I always put oil on our baking trays just out of habit I don't know why really but for this because it is quite sticky and gooey the best thing I found is cling film on top of the foil and then once you put it on there you just sort of gently push it Pat it down with a spoon baking tray wise it doesn't matter the size what you're really looking for is the depth is how thick you want your little chocolate treats to be basically I'm not going to fill up the whole tray here I'm going to fill probably even half of it and because you don't cook it and when you put it in the fridge it will just stay exactly where you've left it so as you can see I have finished molding it to the plate and as you well as you can see as you can see it really does stay put you can do all sorts with it I'm going to put this in the fridge and at least for a couple of hours I would say and then we can do the top [Music] baby [Music] okay [Music] so onto the top of this one and what you need is lots and lots of chocolates as much as you want really Chris likes is chocolate so into three bars candies are 200 grams each then some white chocolate for the decoration and these are hunter grams and I've got two of them so you might have some left over but it's very hard to gauge because it depends as well how rough the top of your fridge cake has set so once you've broken up all your milk chocolate into a bowl just like before be very very careful to do this slowly so just to explain that in hindsight because I'm adding a chocolate topping which I don't normally do with rich cake you might have needed a deeper Paik baking tray so I'll show you how is improvised twisting old Cheerios box just to put it up the side so it doesn't leak out into the rest of the pan [Music] so now to do the ghosts on top of your chocolate you'll need a teaspoon and a toothpick what to do is do a blob that you're going to stretch out with the toothpick [Music] [Music] it's ready for the eyes and the eyes are done with dark chocolate so I'm just bringing some water to a good steam and I'm going to melt a little bit of dark chocolate and then again use a toothpick and just do little dots and do a couple of mouths on the big ones [Music] [Music] meaning they just peed [Music] so there you have it a really simple super yummy recipe hope you enjoyed the spooky video if you liked it give it a thumbs up and don't forget to comment down below and of course subscribe thank you for watching see you soon [Music] you [Music] you", "ZSvatb2lFBI": "hello hi today we're going to be trying the limited edition dove white chocolate lemon meringue candies they're special for spring it really intrigues me so we tried a dove chocolate not that long ago and i think it was the first step chocolate that we had ever reviewed on this channel it was for valentine's day it was the truth or dare dark chocolate with the cookie pieces in it those were actually pretty good but i did say in that video that i don't like dove chocolate because of how rich it is and how it really coats the inside of your mouth and i think that's why people love dub chocolate but that's just not my thing just having like a plain piece of chocolate is not my thing this is white chocolate i don't think i've ever had white chocolate from dove at least they're honest that it's white chocolate and the natural chocolate hey it's lemon meringue guys basically like you know this is white chocolate smells good it has a very similar scent to lemon oreos which are one of my favorite things and lemon meringue pie is one of my favorite pies i don't think you'll be able to tell but there are two different layers of colors there's a lighter one and then a darker yellow kind of looks like how lemon meringue would look the two different colors holy white chocolate that's too much that's so disappointing there's definitely a lemon flavor but when you smell it the lemon is so strong and when you think of lemon meringue pie you think of like a really tart sharp lemon curd in the pie right this doesn't have that and it's kind of leaving a real perfumey aftertaste in my mouth the first flavor that i got was intense white chocolate and then it finished with like a little bit of lemon like a little bit of that lemon oreo flavor definitely not for me but you have said in a lot of our videos and i've pointed it out in another video not that long ago that you have been enjoying white chocolate recently but this is like an expectations thing when you think of lemon meringue pie you think of a specific thing and this isn't it so if they had just said like lemon white chocolate maybe i'd feel differently about it but i don't because i just don't think it's a good lemon flavor that's fair it's leaving a bad aftertaste and we had something oh it was the m ms it was the key lime pie m m's those tasted like pie even though it was a white chocolate that was the video that i recently mentioned that you have been recently mentioning that you like white chocolate so that one the white chocolate like didn't overpower it it really tasted like healing pie and you even got a graham cracker flavor in that this doesn't taste like pie this isn't giving you any sort of graham cracker or pie crust sort of thing i almost would have enjoyed like a cookie piece in there like even just like a sugar cookie or some sort of like maybe something to give like the crunch i don't know like something different those key lime pie m m's just really hit it out of the park they really did such a great job packing the pie flavor into that m m these don't taste like pie and they barely taste like lemon it's mostly just white chocolate that's all

color or even white for the white chocolate is easy to answer some chocolate maker will tell you white chocolate is not chocolate why do they say that because you only have one part of the cocoa in it not the two part that creates the full cocoa so you have only the cocoa butter you don't have what we call generally the cocoa liquor so that's why you're wise is white your milk is lighter than the dark and also because on for everything that is not that you add dairy product so all of this creates this difference of colors", "DRC4Pdj3f9g": "white chocolate [Applause] [Music] that's just a fly

are ready to show you how to make delicious white chocolate truffles with vanilla and rolled in some raspberry powder so let's get started so loves you so much troubles is some white shark and of course Sita Manila power suppressor powder butter cream and a pitch shot I'm going to do is to bring my cream to a boil and just quickly add in my Caesar vanilla pod and just stir that around and then I'm gonna take off the heat and Pat in my white chocolate and just gonna stay in there for about a minute before I stirring it and when that is well mixed I am going to add in my soul and my father and mix this and then I'm going to place my chocolate mixed into the fridge for about five six hours and then they are ready to be rolled into some balls and rolled into the raspberry powder and then I'm going to place them in the fridge again for 30 minutes and then they are released [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I really hope you enjoyed my white chocolate fellows and inner child teach yourselves damaged kitchen and it will find all ingredients down there and I've changed a bit since my beginning of this video but I ended up having them in the fridge oh when I just let the completion set I don't know I said in the beginning that you should put them in the fridge or three four or five hours before you are rolling them but cook them in the fridge for about twelve hours because white chocolate is very very soft to work with after those three or four hours so and you would see that in the video so put them in overnight or 812 hours and then roll them but you really have to give them a go and I hope or subscribe to my channel here and I will see you all again tomorrow bye", "rcIzJVB6oCI": "[Music] chuck zero their new winter edition truffles um jennifer got these

"iyE-5MLaJTg": "what's going on guys Bobby with consumer time capsule back with another review for you here and today we are at the capsule to talk to you about one of the four new types of Snickers bars but we already talked to you about the other three now we're left with nothing but white chocolate Snickers it's the line extension nobody asked for it's a regular Snickers bar but with white chocolate coating so you've still got the peanuts caramel and nougat but on the outside you got white chocolate now the white chocolate Snickers has actually been around for quite some time in a lot of foreign markets including Russia and recently enough that recently but I guess a couple months ago I had the idea to review white chocolate Snickers so I paid up and got Russian white chocolate Snickers and then what happened like two days later they announced regular Americans that don't go on eBay and spend the premium pricing would also have access to white chocolate Snickers so I guess I'm just gonna go ahead and put the Russian one in the archives and because really there is no reason to compare our Russian Snickers to an American white Snickers I mean come on that would just be no goal against Tigers and I'm gonna go ahead and keep it so they're white chocolate is so incredibly yellow I mean it is as yellow as it gets I'll put it on a white plate just to illustrate that is off-white as can be that is not white Snickers do you know what the color white is as Snickers yellow right there doesn't have the same ring to it well Cheers see what this has got to offer I kind of like it I like it more than I thought it would you know you know it reminds me of the Russell Stover white white bunnies like the white chocolate bunnies melted on top of the inside of a Snickers bar that's that's a good combo mmm and that's what the inside looks like hmm that's exceeding my expectations for sure how about you Ryan I'm really look at that much you don't like it that much okay we don't usually disagree but I think this is one time when we have to fight you I like it look don't get me wrong do not misinterpret what I'm saying this is not better than a regular Snickers bar that's not that's not the point that I'm making but a white chocolate Snickers actually sounds kind of gross and I think they pulled it off pretty well I like I like the white I like the white chocolate like Easter Bunny type things and that's what this reminds me of and it combines good elements of a Snickers bar with it so I'm overall I'm pretty happy now the gimmick grade of a white chocolate Snickers because it's very ridiculous and shouldn't exist and they shouldn't have even tried it it means it's a good gimmick if you pass by Oh white chocolates they call it Snickers white if you pass by a Snickers white I like white chocolate Snickers better it's conversationally it does it's a little risky on that but if you pass by a Snickers white or as I call it a white chocolate Snickers and you're not interested this channel is not for you [Laughter] it's a beautiful-looking package and it is a dollar ninety-nine at 7-eleven which is where I found it but if you get two then it's two for three bucks so you know I'm not too bad I have one for the collection and one to review so not too bad buck 50 apiece you know I just can't give it less than an eight I just I I'm gonna give it an eight because I just on gimmick I mean give it an eight on gimmick because I think that the gimmick is just it's cool it's cool it's cool and it's dumb and it's memorable and the package looks good so that's checking all the boxes bye you know it's not so wild that you can give it higher than an eighth either it's still a Snickers bar with a different kind of chocolate on it now for the bar itself you know I know I'm gonna be rating it higher than Ryan so there is a difference in opinion and usually when we say someone's good it's pretty Universal when we say someone's bad it's pretty Universal this is one where we've got a split so I do I do want to put that out there because that's pretty uncommon all right but what I will say on this one is you know I talked a lot about what I like the only thing that I don't like is that I've had a regular Snickers to compare it to and it and it can't compete with that right that's the negative is that you've had the best version so when you have something that isn't quite as good it does make you want the original but really it's it's not it's really not bad I think you guys should try it it's grown and I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 okay I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 for a white chocolate product it's not overwhelmingly sweet it's sweeter than normal Snickers but it's not like that oh my god let me drown in water like those snap crackle pop errs those vanilla ones and stuff that was a bad that was bad white chocolate this is pretty good white chocolate so didn't give it up to him seven nine ten on the taste what do you think Reese's Cups and white Kit Kats I think this is better than both I think this is better it better than any of the other products white Twix white Reese's Cups they're all the you know it's varying degrees of okayness but I'd say this is superior to those I think of the white chocolate that they use is better so you know you you put better in you get better out I guess is what it all boils down to so not about outing I think you guys should try the white chocolate Snickers doesn't really give me the impression that it's gonna be around too awfully long I think that this is just kind of something that they're trying out for a little while and I'm glad that they did I think it was I think it was good so I hope you guys enjoyed the review and until next time of course I'll miss it till I see you Cheers", "zSD4I3R_ZrU": "i think we're now live streaming so i think we're just getting on it so um um we've basically got the arpaio milks and we're going to start do you want to start with the 50 or the 65 created by the great dane mikel frisco um and goss i miss seeing nickel he's he's not been well recently but he's getting the recovery back and this is just i mean if you ever want to get people to understand how you know different percentages can just create the most extraordinary bars when we do our milk tasting these are the bars that we have inside and i am just super excited just to be trying these so sorry which one are we starting with i think we're gonna start 65 that's so funny i was just opening that up look at that we go for purple before green okay sure whatever you say so this packaging is a lot easier to deal with given that you've been having some issues with your packaging today dad yeah nice and full huh i think you can really see that now oh wow okay fantastic melt tastes like corn tastes like corn flakes in a good way but you really get the chocolate coming out of it yeah you do there isn't much milk to sort of you know hide your way by the cereal flavor to it yeah i do you're right yeah amazing it's really good though really develops beautifully it's crazy because people kind of talk about oh you would devour a whole whole bar of milk chocolate in one go this is tiny and i think one piece of it is rich enough there's so much depth and complexity in it yeah i mean this is definitely worth savoring but now let's move on let's compare it to the wow reasons as well very reasonably quite mentally there's a little bit of menthol my throat can feel it in a good way okay 50 this is the opaya milk well they're both papaya they're both opera okay okay very similar nose really different mouthfeel though much much much creamier no the nose is much more whiny i would say but when you try this okay let me have another go and see if you'll write on the nose but what you definitely get caramel beautiful beautiful beautiful length so we're going to be doing this it's great i still think it's quite raisingly quite whiny yeah you definitely get that fermented sense to it so this so one of the really interesting things we're going to be doing in a few weeks time is we're going to do a wine and chocolate tasting and we've actually got two reds to go with some chocolates which is sort of you know a great thing to be doing but actually we're going to be basically also doing some dark milks with some um quite oaky french chardonnays and we almost picked these chocolates but we've actually picked something else but it could have worked with these ones too i don't know i don't know whether i would want to pair this with a chardonnay it's an extraordinary sensation we actually picked slightly brighter ones we actually pretty we can go on to the next bar to discuss this because it's actually an indian chocolate from hiduki that we picked um but it's made by standout and it's a dark milk but it's sort of somewhere between the two but this almost pipped it to the post but in the end that's what we didn't do but they are absolutely drinking sort of chardonnay don't have it bone cold but basically if it's oat just try it and it should be amazing you think this would go well then", "kg0nfq5lUFM": "[Music]

chocolate review if you're new here my name is kelly and on this channel we bake things we eat things and we talk about baking and eating things but you might like that yes today we are eating and talking about chocolate and today's video includes a brand that is brand new not only to the channel but also to my mouth not only that but today's review video involves one of the most fun sounding brand names i have encountered thus far in my life we are talking about fjock now fioc cioccolade are a norwegian chocolate company these guys are making bean to bar chocolate meaning they are in charge of the whole process it means everything is fair trade everything is ethical everything is good and will likely taste better than almost all mass-marketed chocolate can you tell how excited i am so as i said fjoc are based in norway and they have a whole range of flavors and bars and chocolate products you can buy i have never tasted their chocolate before the only norwegian chocolate brand i think i have ever tasted is now do forgive me i believe they're called frya but i may be making that horrendously german and not norwegian at all my deepest apologies regardless i am incredibly excited to be tasting this chocolate from my nordic neighbors let's get into it so we're going to be tasting two different bars from fjock today the first is a 70 reindeer moss and lincoln berry bar and the other is going to be a milk chocolate with brunost which is actual cheese i'm so so excited let's do it so i think we're going to begin today's review with the 45 milk brunost bar brunost is a caramelized cheese now this is incredibly hard to describe if it's something you haven't seen or tasted before i can put some images up on screen brunost comes in kind of a big golden brown cube usually it seems to be quite widely available in norway i have only been to norway once but i had to taste it when i was there and i loved it the only way i can kind of describe its flavor and texture is somewhere between toffee and swiss cheese it's bizarre but if you ever get the chance to taste it do it because it is so unique and so delicious hence why i couldn't resist but pick it up in the form of a chocolate bar so because this bar is a milk chocolate it contains just cocoa beans sugar cocoa butter milk powder brown goat cheese and sea salt let's get into it i must compliment fyak on their packaging as well it has this gorgeous kind of scandi minimalism that's very appealing so when we open this up not only do we have beautiful kind of almost book-like card packaging and patterns so we have a little bit more information on fiac their product and their processes which is just love it there is certainly an undeniable caramel smell coming from this bar you can smell that kind of milky cocoa but you know there's some kind of toasty toffee vibes going on in there good snap which we love let's taste the fjac brunost chocolate and see how it is oh that is wonderful if you love salted caramel pause this video go and buy this bar and then come back and we can chat that is one of the richest little mouthfuls of flavor i think i have ever had as soon as you put it in your mouth the first flavor you get is this kind of smoky saltiness followed by that extra kind of smoky caramel flavor you know nothing artificial and flavoring like just something you can tell has properly had kind of toasted sugar in there well i wouldn't say that you would immediately know there was cheese in here it definitely evokes the flavor of that brunost cheese from when i've tasted it at least which is this gorgeous rich smooth buttery caramel flavor and on top of that chocolate not only do you have that kind of lovely smooth super creamy milk chocolate but you get this little kiss of texture from what i'm guessing are those crunchy little sea salt flakes unless they're kind of dry little bits of that bruno's cheese in there but it's this lovely kind of gentle almost biscuity crunch in amongst that chocolate just genuinely gorgeous i didn't really expect anything less when i saw the flavor when i saw the packaging i knew we were in for some exciting stuff here but what we have is a well-tempered great textured bar that is just punching with flavor for being a completely unique flavor and for being exactly as it says it is going to be that's a 5 out of 5 for me without hesitation let us delve into our second product today which honestly if you thought toasted goat's cheese wasn't a crazy enough chocolate inclusion prepare to have your socks entirely blown off you because we are now talking about a 70 dark chocolate with reindeer moss and lingonberry now these are two ingredients i barely even know what they are let alone what they taste like lincoln berry is something i have only ever seen in the form of jam to accompany swedish meatballs or in a jar in ikea i will be completely honest i think that is the only time i have ever heard of this similarly and as i'm sure you can imagine reindeer moss isn't something we come across regularly in scotland but having looked it up i believe it is obviously some kind of plant but that it is used in thickening soups and stews and it can even have this kind of mushroom taste to it so i honestly have no idea what's going on here and i love it so let's get into this bar and see what we've got it includes cocoa beans sugar cocoa butter lingonberry and reindeer moss that's it no added vegetable fats no added sweeteners and flavors other than just the basic natural ingredients again we open up to this utterly gorgeous packaging and we have a very dressed up looking bar so while on one side you will see that this is just exactly the same as the other bar was with its sort of elongated rectangular chocolate chunks on the back of the bar it looks like we have speckles of what appears to be those dried lingonberries and that reindeer moss let me just let me just ballisima so looking at this bar it looks as though these lincoln berries are almost going to be like dried cranberries something i have a lot of time for but this reindeer moss is truly new to me the smell initially is honestly just quite a fruity dark chocolate so let's see how it tastes this is wonderfully bizarre if you are a lover of fruity chocolate whether that's you know the simplicity of a cadbury fruit and nut bar or a dark chocolate bar that has complex fruity notes this is one for you i'm not even sure exactly what i'm tasting the dark chocolate itself is a seriously bold fruity kind typically i am not the biggest fan of fruity chocolate i much prefer a kind of big ballsy nutty dark chocolate but this is intriguing the lincoln berries in there have the same kind of texture as a dried cranberry or a raisin as you would probably expect though i would probably put the flavor more towards the cranberry side it's not super sweet it has that kind of mellow sugariness that's also overpowered by a real kind of tartness a kind of sourness and when it blends in in your mouth with that dark chocolate it's very kind of red whiny but i don't really know why as for the reindeer moss it might be that i don't really know what i'm searching for when i taste it because i've never tasted this ingredient before but there seems to just be this kind of little a little kiss of earthiness in amongst everything i don't even really know what i mean by that i don't know if i mean mushroomy i don't know if i mean beet rooty i don't know if i just mean a different kind of chocolate flavor i have no idea it's certainly not immediately detectable it's not like the first time you would taste licorice or black coffee or chili anything that would be wildly memorable and potentially unpleasant it's a really subtle flavor if anything and i'm not entirely sure what it brings to the bar because i don't know what it is so perhaps i'm not qualified to be discussing the merits of moss but that being said this is a hugely enjoyable bar the chocolate has a wonderfully smooth texture you heard that great snap so you know it's been tempered well and taken care of the ingredients are nicely dispersed so each little chunk will get a whisper of each and it's just a nice smooth non-bitter dark chocolate if that's your thing overall i would probably say i didn't personally enjoy it as much as the brunost which was just exceptional but this is still a very good bar and definitely want to try if you were into funky new ingredients so i'm going to give this one a 4 out of 5. if you guys have ever tasted norwegian chocolate if you are an aberdonian like me who has connections to norway simply to the city you live in do let me know i'd like to know of your experience with norwegian suites and things

and we are also gonna fill them with some white chocolate ganache I have a video tutorial on how to make the white chocolate ganache you can check at the end of this video and also down in a description box for our first step we're gonna be using some white chocolate and we're gonna fill our mold a recipe note you don't have to use tempered chocolate to follow my tutorial today so you fill all of your cavities and then I'm using a little offset spatula just to make sure that all of the white chocolate is completely right up the sides right to the top of the mold tap your mold to release air bubbles from the chocolate and then scrape off the excess from the top of the mold invert your mold place it on your silicone mat and leave it there for a few hours until the chocolate has completely set up for our next step we take our white chocolate ganache put it into a piping bag and now we're gonna fill our cavities an important note when you are filling the cavities make sure that you don't put too much chocolate because we are going to be adding more chocolate at the end to close the bottom of the chocolates I'm just evening this out with the end of a paintbrush and then if you need a little bit more in some of them just add a little bit more but not too much to close the chocolates up as our final step we will now fill the bottom of the chocolate mold with regular chocolate and that is our final step give your mold another tap that will settle all of the chocolate really nicely and then take a large spatula and just clean off the top of the mold which will eventually become the bottom of our chocolates let your chocolates sit for a few hours to make sure that they are completely set and then you can place them in the fridge for about 15 minutes and this will help with the unmolding and to finish off our video tutorial let's cut into it you can see the nice crisp outside shell and also the nice soft chocolate ganash in the middle so that's it for this

action yeah okay so nutrition I hope you'll get some dark chocolate is higher in calories yeah because of the fat content that's a good thing yeah dark chocolate has half the sugar and really for all the health we know the sugars a bad thing let's cut more of the sugar angle for the dark chocolate compare the two dark chocolates four times of caffeine so I don't know where as a promoter corn and it's on your caffeine intake Excel and other pens on the much McCoys the caffeine that you're gonna get from dark chocolates if you're a coffee drinker which I am the caffeine from dark chocolate is like a drop in the ocean yeah yeah you don't get very much at all well dr. Bowles has four times the theobromine so for anyone doesn't know bromance yes that's good for lowering blood pressure so that's got for MSM oh well there you go - I've had that dark chocolate lowers your blood pressure I never know why yes the theobromine and has no brew science that is real science so we need to kind of fight milk chocolate score Nadia because I feel like it we can but let's face it we all know the health benefits of dark chocolate milk chocolate tastes damn good when it comes to diet and lifestyle I like to say if you want a bad point white chocolate milk chocolate in your life then taste nor the end of the world it depends on how much you're having and how often you're having it if y'all go for dark chocolate aim for 70% cocoa or above what we love a flavoring the other sleeve eggs in today I am going to love a mint I like I like mint chocolate have a really dark like you know if you get 85% dark chocolate with a hint of mint to do that we go all jigna nice it's nice try the dark chocolate white chocolate no chocolate what a little bit I'm making white chocolate few times so fast it doesn't put what you chocolate I do this I really doesn't even a higher Manchu garnish I smell chocolate we're going to ask the Milky Bar kid what do you do ice cream if it I was like five I don't think you know too much of it dr. Bell leave it on if it's a choice between dark and milk chocolate then you have to look at the rest of your diet I would say normally speaking go for the dark chocolate okay it's gonna be really good fats that's gonna get you you said more caffeine more caffeine that's going to give you more theobromine theobromine your blood pressure to lower your blood pressure so then the dark tones gonna be better and you make a plan to eat chocolate since back to the down one", "O7DBaE7HMKY": "hello and welcome back to real next snack and food reviews so i've been struggling getting on some of these reviews and 7-elevens been doing some new things and i've been way behind and some of it's been the fact that our 7-elevens are slow oh well um so i i'm way behind on one of the reviews it'll be coming within the next few days uh at least i'll try and have it coming but the review i have for y'all right now these are the most fragile ones of the batch of stuff i have left to review so i don't want to take them on the road with me it is new 7-eleven seven select fizzy pop uh candy bars so you got three you got popping candy and orange cream soda flavored white confection none of them would have like a bottle design popping candy and root beer soda flavored milk chocolate that's interesting and then popping candy and cherry soda flavored milk chocolate so i'm going to do reverse order there i don't know what i feel about cherry soda chop milk chocolate but we'll go ahead and open it um take a look at the bar and just snap one piece off of it so it doesn't look much different than a regular chocolate bar i can't see where there's cherry flavor or anything i can see all the pop rocks i can feel them but it just looks like a normal chocolate bar for the most part but yeah we'll put that aside and uh here's a little nugget that i'm gonna try and tell y'all what i think you remember that kat i tried the other day or yesterday or whatever um well you got a sour flavor to it well this kind of reminded me of that but i was more ready for it because i got the warning signs i got the language telling me you know you're gonna have a cherry flavor it's gonna be like a cherry soda overall it's not bad i got this nice popping fizz in my mouth we'll get that throughout the review um it's not terrible but i think it's a bit sweet a bit artificial and i don't know it kind of wrecks your mouth but for what it is i i don't know i think it's kind of good um unfortunately whoever i share this with probably won't like it and i think it's gonna be a hard sell on y'all um if y'all see this one i just it's a bit weird it's not your typical cherry milk chocolate type of thing it's got a sour note to it so with that i'm gonna give it a six because i do recommend it if you are brave and you have this wide open palette um so i i don't want to recommend it if you're picky so now we're doing chocolate root beer beer has its distinct flavor but i don't know how distinct it will be when chocolate gets involved um but as i said i feel i felt like my least favorite would end up being the cherry and i mean it was okay but i really just feel like it's gonna be hard to mess up these other things so yeah this is root beer here's the piece it's nothing special pop it in my mouth and tell you what i think again it's there the flavor is exactly what you would expect you got root beer flavor very distinct very noticeable again i'm not i'm actually not really a fan of that one but i mean it's okay um the taste is very sour again with the root beer notes um i'm gonna put it right on the bar with the other one of six this one's for the ones who are risky who can take the mixture of chocolate and root beer but it's definitely there for sure you definitely have root beer flavor the pop rocks are really cool that's the real cool concept of it all um but yeah this is a very weird set of candy bars um so you're just gonna have to think if you see these in the store and you're like i might want to buy them just be ready for those really weird flavors okay so i'm hoping the orange one is the best um of course i was wearing these two and i gave them both a six which may be over hyping them maybe a bit over hyped but i'm trying to be fair here they do hit the flavor as advertised so i don't want to criticize or condemn them for something that's not really their fault they're trying to make it as accurate as possible when they do a fine job but i think all these should have been white chocolate if you want my honest opinion because i just feel like milk chocolate makes it even more weird but yeah i mean they they they carry the flavor so i can't be so hard on these okay i like the side of this one this is really pretty i'll show you the whole bar look at that thing orange and bright and everything i am hyped up so don't let me down here guys i know orange flavor orange cream flavor things can be disappointing at times but i'm really hoping this isn't you know what i'm surprised about is we haven't had an orange cream donut yet like that's a big opportunity or a peach doughnut you know that's a big summer opportunity and they don't take it they do limit and key lime and all that and stuff and cherry and strawberry but they they don't do the mango peach orange they don't ever do it so here's this little nugget excuse me um i'm going to try it and then uh we'll call this a review but uh pretty weird so far pretty weird so hopefully this one's not as weird but be prepared for anything yeah i mean [Music] still not my favorite thing and i think it's just because like you get the soda flavor too you don't just get the the flavor of cherry or the flavor orange you get a soda flavor but this one's definitely better than the others i think mainly because they don't have milk chocolate in them but again i i find them to be very strange bars and so if you want this weird experience like you're like wow so weird so cool man this is the one for you um so i'm pretty intrigued about those slurpee pies that i have as well those will be getting a review very soon um but these um overall if you are not one who likes soda that cancels you out b if you don't like risks cancel you out see if you don't like chocolate mixed with weird things cancelled you out um orange i don't i'm gonna give it a 7. it's solid i think it's better than the other two it does know the flavor like the other two but it's more it's you can handle a little bit more it's still just like it's odd so it is a very odd set of candy bars and if you are quite picky you just probably don't want to mess with these but if you're ready for anything and i mean anything folks take this risk because they're not if you want those flavors they got no flavors in um but i would say the least risky one is the popping candy and orange cream soda flavored white confection so that's it that's my review a little bit long but wordy but had to entertain y'all with this before i let these things melt so uh yeah that's what i got and i will see you all around", "kzsOJYsGIfA": "Ashley and I are going to try to new lent candy bars these are from Target there are two dollars each but they're good size candy bars this was the lint hello my name is salted caramel and this one is hello my name is dark chocolate cookie so which one do you women you want to try the dark chocolate cookie chocolate yeah he really dark chocolate okay the serving says this is two and a half servings are in this bar this is how it looks when you open it up like a gift and Ashley it's going to show you the candy bar there are two hundred servings in the bar and you get four pieces for 210 calories it's just it's dark chocolate with a creamy chocolate filling and dark if it ever turn it over look special on the other side oh right that's nice-looking and you get you're supposed to get four of those but it says brownie in the middle it's supposed to be cookie our cookie in the met it says well creamy chocolate filling and dark cookie pieces don't like that texture something just squirted into my mouth and I don't like that at all that's the same texture of the truffles I've made at home does coffee truffles very very smooth when you bite into it though that Center like explodes in your mouth it's a little thicker than pudding yeah it's not actually like it come on you can put that on your tongue and let it melt slowly and let that flavor really come through it's a decent dark chocolate it's not real bitter no it's not bitter I like the crunchy piece isn't it yes yes you get crunchy cookie pieces I like better I don't know if I eat it all the time like I wouldn't want that for a night want a snack or anything but it's good that's it that's very good yes okay and now we'll try the salted caramel the same thing you open it up like this and we'll go ahead and give that to actually since it takes a little bit of time this says milk chocolate with salted caramel filling so I'm sure I should would like this right away since she heard the word salt well in milk chocolate you like milk chocolate this is once again two and a half servings per container you get full pieces for 200 calories I have a whole square this time I still have a one huh so doctor good immediately so taste the salt it's good salt running it's running horrible mm-hmm not running is a caramel caramel is I'm whose caramel like water this is thicker than that mm-hmm still not some it's been that much money on all the time I would for the richness of the chocolate you can tell it's creamy it is a good quality chocolate for that quality and for that amount I don't think $2 is bad but something no because there's no way you could eat that whole bar at one time no no yeah you I'm thinking about two squares man yeah you would be good at two squares so you could make that last for a little while but what's an actual serving size the serving size is four pieces for 200 calories so I couldn't eat for them that's not bad at all no I like sweets because you could that will last for a long that's real or like a mystery so out of the two I would give these a five and would eat these regular oh yeah those are really good and then I give two but actually doesn't care for doctor chocolate like I do I would give these more of a full I'll give them a three I would say four but I know I won't won't bother us again because I'm not well if I go to a buy a candy bar I don't buy a dark chocolate candy bar even though I like it but I'll give all my three cuz they are really really good so thanks for watching I want to say thank you to Ryan for these recommendations Ryan is always really good at telling me the new things that are coming out at Target so don't forget us Ryan and thank

does it taste like Milky Bar does it taste like caramel or does it taste like neither is it just a lovely borrowed chocolate let's find out out of all of the products that have arrived the Aldi this is the one that everyone seems to be talking about it's a white chocolate bar and everyone is going nuts for it but why are they going nuts for it some people say it tastes like milky bar some people take say it tastes like the old favorite the Cara Mac which is the caramelized white chocolate but I really really want to find out for myself so let's open it up and try it [Music] [Music] okay said you really want my opinion you want my honest honest honest opinion on this I'm sorry to say that it doesn't taste like Kara Mac in my opinion that's it you might think it does you might be reliving some old memories of what kara Mac tasted like from what I remember kara Mac tasted a little bit burnt caramelized sort of flavor lots of caramel flavor mix of white chocolate this is a white chocolate Asus is closer to a milky bar than it is a Kara Mac for sure having said that that is a really lovely soft white chocolate a vegan white chocolate I'm used to having vegan white chocolate and it's just really sugary and you don't really have much flavor apart from just a really intense sweet taste that is different that actually tastes like it's got some sort of chocolate in and it does it's got 20 27% in 27 percent chocolate and that's really important because you know and you can taste it so fair play fair play too rowdy that's a really really nice walk chocolate does it taste like Hera Mac in my opinion no I'm sorry [Music] so for the I think it cost maybe one pound twenty one pound forty some another I can't remember its low cost less than one pound fifty anyway it's a cracking bar a chocolate that really really good I would definitely buy it again it's so soft it almost melts in your hand and imagine what it does in your mouth in really really really is creamy and lovely and just I can imagine making desserts with it and everything it's a really really good bar I will buy this again Aldi if you're watching keep this do not make this a special bye we need we

are from the desert truffle collection at Target these were 399 bags so they're not cheap at all there are three servings in a bag and you serving sizes four pieces so there are about twelve balls in here for four dollars so you know we are gonna try the pecan caramel sundae dessert trouble first and it actually gets it out I will tell you what it says on the bag show what it looks like to our pecan caramel sundae dessert truffle is a delicious twist on a classic ice cream favorite smooth caramel is wired over a creamy white chocolate filling blended with pecans all wrapped inside a milk chocolate shell so bite into it Ashley you can smell it pecan four pieces is 210 calories I should have figured out how many each how many calories each before we started I don't taste anything on that taste white chocolate and caramel it's good but it's not worth $4 mmm it's very good if I had to bet on camera I would have actually put it in my mouth and let it melt there for a little while let it fester yeah because I'm it's really really good very rich like Ashley said I don't know that it's worth $4 it's very good chocolate that's that's nice show that's up you know that's different than Hershey's or something like that so I like that myself okay now we're gonna try the chocolate lava cake and I'm gonna do the same thing I'll give actually these purple for the ultimate in dark chocolate indulge in our chocolate okay dessert truffles as the dark chocolate slowly melts in your mouth rich cocoa flavors emerge through two thick layers of molten chocolate and dark chocolate ganache four pieces are 180 calories so these are this is fewer calories than the one we had before that's straight-up dark chocolate with goo in the middle do you like it I wish it was milk for dark chocolate it's really good and I do not like dark chocolate oh and I need to go that's a very very smooth that's a nice dark chocolate it's not it's not a bitter dark chocolate yeah that's true it's a that's a fine dark I really like that I've had something else that has the same flavor and I can't think what it is a different not Godiva something else but that's that's a really really good dark chocolate it's good and that gue that's in there really adds mmm it's so it's good that's nice I would call that one yeah I would be willing to buy that one again that one was real I like it better than the pecan ice cream caramel okay caramel nut brownie is the last one and it sounds good so we had caramel pecan and then caramel nuts this one is for caramel or pecan caramel sundae this one is carmona brownie okay I'm not saying the full name brownie sorry our caramel nut brownie dessert trouble will slowly melt in your mouth just like the classic dessert smooth caramel is layered over a decadent fudge brownie filling blended with hazelnuts all wrapped inside a dark chocolate shell I wasn't expecting to hear dark Chyna show four pieces is 190 calories I don't know how I feel about that I don't like the dark chocolate it's okay that's good don't get any nut I see where they said brownie though I thought it I've got a brownie taste to it I think it had a definite browning flavor job and I got one little nut I didn't get any nuts at all yeah I got one little nut we split a piece so bring the bags back down I thought that was good out of the three I would buy the chocolate lava cake in a minute I wouldn't buy any of them again you were about if you had to buy one which one is about you have to choose one I guess this one cuz it's the only one milk chocolate oh okay yeah I like that I thought that was really good and this one's good and I would give him I would give this one a four out of five and I would give those those would probably a three just cuz they weren't my favorite these would probably be twos because they're not unbearably disgusting but I wouldn't ever buy them again ever so there you go two completely different viewpoints but thanks for watching I want to say thank you to Ryan for these recommendations Ryan is always really good at telling me the new things that are coming out at Target so don't forget us Ryan and thank you very much", "pWKYLAIwMws": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to round reviews it's something where you are it's Saturday in my world I'm in the mood for a piece of chocolate I mean a little bit selfish this one is totally for me the absolute classic Milka white chocolate if you guys have been with me for any amount of time you know I had some strong feelings for Milka chocolate I'm pretty sure every review I've done on chocolate I've made a milk of reference better Cadbury but I think mocha is my absolute favorite chocolate something with this European brand that they always get it right it's still a nice few versions of Milka that I haven't tried I mean there's so many I just came across into the store I thought I grabbed one and we check it out together it's not a new product but it's a new Terron product you're Trisha facts and ingredients be listed in the pictures at the end let's bust this open and take a taste and here's what the milk of white chocolate looks like classic Milkha just boy guys I'm instantly gonna put this back in the package or it's gonna start melting all over my hands really quick you notice how the white chocolate is like a little bit off color that's how you know you have real white chocolate if you have a white chocolate that is like really white it's probably just palm oil and vanilla there is rules they have to play but if it says white chocolate there has to be a certain amount of cocoa mass to actually be able to call it chocolate and that's where you get the off coloring to but don't ever be put off or fooled if your white chocolate is a little off color there's no bells and whistles on this one it's solid white chocolate which means it's solid delicious and here we go first I'm trying milk of white chocolate that is perfect there is some awesome flavor going on here is so creamy it has a great sweetness the texture of it is so creamy I mean this chocolate is to die for and I shouldn't be surprised I mean it is Milka and they never disappoint guys this is delicious so for European chocolate it is definitely on the sweeter side of things but it's not like American white chocolate sweet you definitely get a great flavored chocolate super creamy super delicious and guys I don't think you're gonna get much better white chocolate than this one does Ron think a milky white chocolate you know it's fire Ron's given this 9210 in general I'm not the biggest white chocolate fan but when Milkha slaps his name on it turns out I really like it I found this at a store called Rossi's across Canada if you have a Rossi's near you you might find it there this has been a quick book at Milka white chocolate it's been a quick round reviews and see you guys next time you", "7rjJVSEMYtw": "hey there milk chocolate candy bar lovers this is randy the wild horse i got something to try just for you here it is king size hershey's milk chocolate and whoppers milk chocolate with malt flavored cookie bits with other natural flavors

i'm alicia and we're the snacker girls so today we are reviewing the russia box i am wicked stoked a lot of reviews already on facebook they seem really good so we're a little delayed but i am so excited because everyone says such good things if you remember last time we did have a trivia question from columbia so cassie is going to read that question for you and give you the answer and then we're going to do a trivia question from russia okay so if you remember the question was in colombia hot cocoa isn't complete without a cayenne b ketchup c cheese or d mayo all gross to me yes i agree um the answer is cheese by the way um queso fresco if you to be specific but they say mozzarella works as well if you want to give it a try okay that's disgusting i think i'm ready to hear our trivia question for russia okay in 1989 russia traded one of the world's largest military fleets in exchange for what a a u.s satellite b t c pepsi or z a family of lions put it down in the comments we're curious to know what you think it is i think a u.s satellite probably sounds the most i mean yeah i would absolutely go you know a whole fleet of military in exchange for a satellite i feel like i don't know um i guess we'll find out in the next video all right let's jump in we have some awesome things here we have some gummy candies we have some cookies we got chocolate and chocolates i'm so excited i got bread interesting right in a package so we're excited let's get started you ready i'm ready boiled milk and chocolate cake so you may remember that cassie and i are doing weight watchers so we announced that last video we had when we did the munch pack and we were saying how many points each thing is so we're gonna do the same we're gonna start off with our boiled milk and chocolate cake uh it is seven points so definitely something you you want to save your points for if it's good uh but i'm eager to try it smells like um almost like a a hostess snack or something oh my god absolutely very similar to something that we have here in america i'm struggling to think it feels like one of those like fake brownies is it like the swiss rolls is what it smells like yes yes so it's very cakey on the inside so it's like a cake in the center with a chocolate covered outside it's very good um i'm a big fan i definitely like it better than a hostess product for sure i'm trying to see what's inside so it's a rich wafer cake filled with another local favorite can't pronounce this don't hate me it's like shigushi yonka it's a ridiculously creamy caramel made by boiling sweetened condensed milk so that must be where the boiled milk comes in interesting i really liked it uh if it wasn't seven points i would be eating it all the time but i'm gonna give it a green happy face um i'm also gonna give it a green i enjoyed that ripe pear milk chocolate okay so i'm very excited about this one is ripe pear milk chocolate it is a chocolate bar with pear like you don't see that often we've really been looking forward to this one so i opened up the box before we did the video and it's been a little bit since i got the box so this is one of the ones we've been looking forward to most and i'm very excited however this is 12 points so oh my god okay just a small piece for me today try to open this without save the package as much as i can so it is like a whole piece i find this very interesting i don't know if you can see but the inside is very clear it's a clear inside almost like a jelly yeah like a jelly this is so wow it is a very very sweet strong jelly pear taste like i'm it's so sweet i'm almost glad they don't sell it here oh my god because i would buy that a lot they don't really taste pear but like we don't really have a lot of pear flavored things here for me to compare it to whatever it is is delicious that's amazing it's very sweet like cassie said um i do get like i almost feel like it's like a delicacy like it's one of those fancy chocolates i feel like that's what it reminds me of yeah i think it's i would have to assume that that chocolate is more on the expensive side yeah um just from the how great it tastes it's super sweet oh i think you guys already know how we're gonna vote on that one uh yes green all the way soviets cheese potato chips can you just look how big this chip is like compared to my hand is the size of like your palm oh my god i pulled it out one all casual and i was like oh wait a minute so this is soviet cheese potato chips it's made with absurdly addictive russian cheese smell it you definitely get cheese smell oh wow it smells good very cheesy the bag is six points it is a fairly large bag i would say i'd take the six points one day if i wanted like it's filled pretty normally like you would in america too so all right so let's give it a go a bit harder i'd say than like a lay's potato chip it's not bad i just feel like i was expecting a stronger taste for some reason i think however it's a perfect amount of cheese taste i you can taste the cheese like it's not one of those ones where you're like oh i don't really know the flavor you definitely taste the cheese we've tried a lot of chips yes over these past couple months i would say this is probably one of my top definitely not the top but it's pretty up there yeah i feel like you know how like sometimes you can have a potato chip and there's like a greasiness to it this does not have that it's not as thin um it's definitely thicker it's a little harder it's it's incredibly nice yeah i like a lot of things about it i think the cheese flavor is really good reminds me a little bit of the um what is it cheddar and sour cream yes yeah yeah it reminds me a little bit just not as cheddary but you know how you get that it kind of smells like them too yeah it's really good i definitely approve the consistency reminds me of like the restaurant chips remember come on go to those restaurants and it's like the thickness of them that's what they got like those homemade chips yeah i feel that white chocolate and hazelnut cream wafer so we have another wafer we know how these boxes are so popular for wafers so this is a hazelnut and cream in a sugar cone shell so it's kind of like a wafer bottom and then like a flaky kind of top i guess oh my god it's very creamy in the inside this is my favorite wafer and all of our boxes this is the wafer we have tried so many way boxes guys with so many different wafers and this is it every single box that we've had has had wafers by far this is so good the hazelnut cream is so light but it's like the perfect amount of flavor and it's like it's nice not just having just a wafer if that makes sense like it's wicked cool that they have like the cream inside i feel like everything we have tried so far makes me think high-end like makes me think like i'm gonna spend extra money to try something that is just so delicious it's so rich it's so good and i feel like that's been with everything we've tried so far if you look we just have all green faces right now like it's amazing go russia there so far this has been like our favorite box this is a great i mean i know we're only four and we got 16 more to go so we might be jumping the gun but it's just so good but great start if maybe they put all the really great things first i don't know but like this is so good exotic fruit jellies so now we have a candy these are fruit jellies it looks like we got three different flavors so we'll have to figure out what flavor we got so we either got ripe mango blackcurrant mint and strawberry pepper i i want to say i have them i have the mango this is three points for two jellies so basically having a point right now very thick i absolutely got mango i got mango too maybe we should try the other one definitely a very rich mango taste it's really well made absolutely i'm not like a jelly candy kind of person so i probably wouldn't buy them so this is purple on the outside where these have oh it actually has a picture of a mango i should have looked first so this must be the black currant mint but that one was good very strong taste of mango the whole way through it didn't fade or anything like that so this one's like pink i know very soft in color i feel like this one reminded me of puerto rico right the mango one is way better i'm not very like triple tropical bags but yes i agree the mango one was i was more fan of that one i would probably buy the mango ones where i probably would not buy these but this would be every once in a while kind of thing because i'm not really like a fruit jelly kind of person um but yeah very very flavorful both of them coconut and white chocolate hazelnut balls first of all look at the wrapping of these candies like so neat definitely cute so this is a coconut and white chocolate hazelnut ball i am all about it because i love hazelnut you can see the coconut pieces but you're not a fan of white chocolate are you no very good point so in case you didn't know russia has one of the coldest city on earth um but they actually have subtropical areas so that's where the coconut comes in i do not know that very interesting see biting into it reminds me of one of those like i'm gonna say around with like the pharaoh show ferocious yes but it wasn't like ferrero rochero yeah i hope you don't know what i'm talking about but very similar texture has almost like a wafer outside who is though is i don't i don't mind it i think it's good but i'm not getting hazelnut are you tasting these enough i think i just taste coconut and white chocolate the hazelnut is very strong really i mean the coconut i'm sorry misspoke there but yeah the coconut it overpowers the whole thing if you're a coconut person you'll love this um i taste very slight hazelnut very exciting so if you want this for the hazelnut then this is not the go-to but it's delicious i mean it's good i do like it in regards to weight watchers it was four points for that little one we just wasted four of our daily points for that yeah putting in these points later it's gonna be a whole lot of fun i only get 28 points a day so ouch bowlette mushroom bread bites it smells like mushroom i think yeah i like it though it does smell good there's a lot in the bag they're kind of like croutons like flat that's exactly what they're mine they're bullet mushroom bread bites so i'm in bread but maybe it's a crouton that was so good wow oh my god okay i'm gonna take another one oh my goodness guys and the whole bag is four points there's a lot in there i would put this in soup i would put this on top of salad oh my gosh these are the best croutons if that's what they are that i've ever had in my life i'm not a huge crouton fan but these are so good oh my god like oh my god that russians love mushroom hunting so keep hunting them i need this yes it's so good i i literally want i'm trying to think of a soup that i can have tomorrow that i can put in yes to put some right on top of the soup oh my god this is amazing shockingly this is probably my favorite you could put that in tomato soup oh so good if you like mushrooms you'll definitely like these i know not everyone's a mushroom person but you can definitely get the hint of mushrooms i am not a mushroom person i if i get something with mushrooms i pick the mushrooms off that is just delicious nuts and milk chocolate wafer this little package is nine points what it what what is this one it's not in english um but it's nuts in the milk chocolate can i say it looks more hated like more hazelnut another wafer it's weird like i didn't know that wafers were so popular around the world either until i started universal young so it's very um you can see like the nuts on top it's very textured i wonder if it's because like wafers give you the option to like do so much with so many different flavors and styles they're probably easy to make yeah yeah all right let's give it a go softer than most wafers we've had i'd say you didn't get that crunch it's funny how to me all wafers have that same chocolate smell yep that same exact smell yeah i know you guys know what i'm talking about um i should have read the description first because it literally says russia's softest nuttiest way foreign i was trying to figure out what it reminds me of and i just figured it out nutty bars oh they taste like nutty bars guys they taste a lot like nutty bars very good uh again one of the better wafers that i've had in all these boxes uh i wouldn't buy it i would say but i like it enough to give it a green happy face i wouldn't buy it simply because of points if i wasn't worrying about the points i'd buy it i'd be all about it nine points for this little thing orange marmalade and cinnamon pianic okay so next we have this gingerbread and it is an orange marmalade with and i feel like i'm going to butcher this guys i'm sorry with prionic with prionic yeah maybe so it's a traditional gingerbread and it came in like a thick package um seven points for the entire thing which is not that bad i mean so it seems like it's killing a lot like it's a lot it's pretty hard yes smells like a gingerbread house i feel like and this is something you would get at your grandparents house like i feel like i'd walk into whenever grandmother's house and it would be there i think the orange marmalade in the middle makes it perfect like i think without it it might be a little dry but overall this is really good like like for breakfast with some coffee on the side your teeth this is amazing it would definitely be dry without the marmalade though absolutely but i like it it says the whole thing is flipped coated in sugary syrup and baked the result is a russian tradition that's amazing to behold but even more amazing to eat almond white chocolate bar so this chocolate bar a serving is a third of it and each third is eight points so russia your stuff is amazing but they're very high in points you're not playing around but you're making it worth it i don't even love the packaging like i feel like uh so like fancy like yeah and this is our ozara that's the same company as the pear chocolate that we had so maybe they are just like a fancy chocolate company yeah we're gonna look that up so this is white chocolate with whole almonds in it more white chocolate so you can see the almonds oh yeah clear as day i love white chocolate she's not a huge fan it is one of the things i find to be too sweet it's good but this is probably the most plain thing we've had so far i would agree but that being said i like this white chocolate because it is a very plain very um soft tame taste it's not it's not crazy sweet i think the almonds complement it very well the chocolate and yeah it's not overly sweet but it's really good this is delicious it does seem another like another fancier chocolate you know like this is something that you break out when you have guests yeah like oh let me bring out my fancy chocolate like back in the day when you used to bring out the cookies hint you know i'm just getting that vibe from this entire box it's so good barbecue kebab potato chips barbecue kebab chips i'm a little nervous because a couple boxes ago i think it might have been thailand yeah we had the steak chips and i was not a fan uh they were just so i think they would i think i gave it a mess but it was like just okay and i ended up actually not eating them at all like they ended up going in the trash because i don't keep the snacks forever but i was not a fan so i'm a little nervous for this one and these are kind of like um yeah they're like i don't want to say like um yeah they look almost fake yeah i know i'm struggling like they're much better than the other ones this is seven points for the whole bag i like it you know what they remind me of what they look like you know when you get the packing peanuts yeah they look like they like the way they um what they're made out of looks like packing peanuts it says that this is the fresh russian barbecue flavor it does taste a little different so i mean it's not like a solid american barbecue flavor no those that actually was really really good though i'm a fan strawberry caramel and vanilla gummies gummies so these are actually according to the book they're in celebration of unity day which is on november 4th so it's upcoming very soon what's cool about these is their strawberry caramel and vanilla but if you look at the package it has sort of equations so this plus this equals pink cotton candy and then this plus this equals maybe like a vanilla cotton so you have to like put all of them in your mouth at the same time two of them and it's supposed to taste like something so i think maybe i should do one and then you should do the other i agree okay okay so which one do you want uh i'll do i'll zook i can get anyone they're both curling candy oh so wait that's just like a vanilla so okay so i'll do the regular cotton candy i think that's what i meant we're just regular cotton candy says five pieces are no six pieces are five points so cassie is going to get are they in the shape of hearts um so yes so this is supposed to take us like pink cotton candy and this i guess would be like a vanilla cotton candy i'm ready or so hard to chew they're good the only thing that i'll give a negative on is it's a little too hard to chew but the flavor is so good so i'll give it a break there um how did you like it i liked it i i thought it was very good i liked the pink one i tried first more i thought it was cool how you like eat them together to get a different flavor because they did taste totally different so i thought yeah it was really cool but i'll give it a green face me too it was so good let's celebrate unity day with russia november 4th orange and vanilla biscuits look how thin these are they're so cute guys so these are orange and vanilla biscuits from it looks like janet's bakery oh yeah they fall apart where are you very easy to eat i enjoy these i look how thin they are the orange flavor is a lot stronger than i imagined i like it i can't really say i taste any vanilla but i think it's delicious i love these every time i take a piece another piece balls on the table but these would be great with like you said before coffee tea i would dip them in i think these would be perfect to have if you were having people over for a little bit of tea little coffee you just put a couple on a dish there's thin perfect you can dip them the box is cute we actually got two so we're going to be trying ginger cinnamon soon but yeah these are really good very easy to eat um six cookies is five points so i mean you can have a couple yeah but yeah these are great i wasn't expecting the orange to be as strong so it's like a a plain looking cookie like i thought it was gonna mainly just taste like shortbread i'm enjoying it red hot chili pepper bites i haven't told cassie what these are yet but you should have your water ready are they spicy because that's the only like these are red hot chili pepper oh my eye opened the bag and it smells are they strong smelling oh my god you've kept this from me for quite a while wow i've known there was spicy chips and i didn't say anything i mean i guess i think i had a really bad whiff when i first opened like let me spell like a strong whip i should say but it's not that bad she's lying she's lying why are you always lying you know what smell it again what does it smell like what seasoning it does so it's almost i feel like it smells like a spicy tomato soup i think it smells like sausage like the red pack it's a sausage oh it's like literally what it smells like so this is four points for 14 pieces so if you like it you could have a lot oh my god but yeah so it says there's an assumed rule that russians do don't do hot and spicy so much that there's a local expression which means to give pepper which means to berate or punish someone but every rule has i'm afraid because this is a very strong smell guys it's like a puff like similar to like a cheeto these are really good they're not that spicy i'm not another one they're not very spicy it's a sazon chip i don't understand like i they're not spicy i don't taste i don't think it's hot i like them like another one look at her go wow okay there's a nice little pepper riding a car there's a sweetness to it there is it's very good um i would not consider that spicy i was hoping for a little more spice because i wanted to see cassie's face oh nice but uh yeah those were really i would snack on those for sure i enjoyed that ginger and cinnamon biscuits so these are ginger and cinnamon cookies similar to the ones that we had before same brand just a little darker it says perfect for tea time these remind me of christmas these are also six cookies for five points similar to the other cookies love the texture just like i did the last one i love how thin they are like you don't get cookies this thin and it's like really refreshing yeah you don't get full as quickly like i don't feel like you like you can have multiples and i still be like be fine i like i'm good about eating this strong cinnamon strong ginger i'm a fan i love it lime and mint dark chocolate also from ozera another like fancy chocolate bar has like this nice silver wrapping high in points again though they already disappoint me because so far your chocolate has been so good this is lime and mint dark chocolate i don't know about you cassidy but i love mint i could have it all day i'm okay with mint i do like it they come in these nice little squares definitely like a fancy or chocolate yeah i do like dark chocolate as well satisfying little squares like they're like perfect oh they have a little flower in the middle this is the type of dark chocolate that i would have right after a very healthy meal if you're eating very healthy all day and you're just like i'm gonna just treat myself this would be it like a single square yes and it almost feels like it's rich enough where just a single square is enough absolutely caramel and nuts milk chocolate bar so now we're entering what universal yums is called the favorite flavor countdown so we're down to our last four this is number four on the list we have caramel and nuts milk chocolate bar this looks amazing we were saying how this chocolate is really filling us up we're not used to having this much chocolate i was really excited about it but i can't believe we didn't even dinner after work we just came right here and did this stuffed i'm good like i'll be good for the rest of the night the caramel gives it like a toffee kind of flavor like a texture i mean yeah when i bit i was surprised like it was not what i was expecting when i bit into it oh my god i will give universal yums on the flavor like it has a lot of flavor it has peanuts hazelnuts caramel chocolate and a piece of heaven this is strong though like i feel like there's this is a chocolate bar you couldn't eat in one sitting like it's so heavy it's very thick and the bar itself i dropped this earlier and we were both like what was that however i'm not crazy about it i think this will be my first myth it's not an aftertaste it's got and i don't know if it's the toffee i think it's the nuts that give the aftertaste because i have that aftertaste too but it feels nutty um but i think this is my first meal which really bums me out this is the 17th thing we've tried yeah it has a sweetness that doesn't complement it i feel like there is a there is a um there's an ingredient in there that is not meshing well with it i can yeah i get that too it's just like i mean if you had it at work i would probably steal a piece for you absolutely but it's not something i would buy unlike everything else we've had so far i would literally buy like everything we're not sitting here like oh my god grilled steak bread bites the next we have grilled steak bread bites oh there's somewhere though they're similar to the other like croutons we had they don't smell like anything i don't know i don't know to me they're just like croutons like it's so weird there's like um i could go back and forth i'm like this is weird and i'm like oh though this is tasty no it's good you know what it reminds me of the packets of ramen like the packets of the season that you point to ramen if you were to pour it onto one of these they're pretty good and it's 32 pieces is four points that means eight pieces is only one point they're pretty good these are good i'm a fan those croutons man you russians know how to do this i'm about it sour cream and onion potato chips this is a really cool bag these are our sour cream and onion chips and it says that nobody does sour cream like the russians do they have sour cream for breakfast on pancakes they have it for lunch on sour beet soup and for dinner and they're a beloved beef stroganoff so i'm very excited about these because anywhere i go if they're sour cream and onion chips that's what i'm gonna get they're pretty big they're very thin again like the other potato chips we have they don't feel greasy like lays for example tasty i can definitely see why they made it on the flavor countdown this is number two oh my god and this is 15 chips is four points all right i like it i really enjoy that it lacks the oily yes yes aspect sometimes i think after a bag of chips when it's too greasy you can feel a little bit like like nauseous little sick it's heavy on your stomach and these don't have that yeah i think these are much better than american sweet uh sour cream and onion chips i agree i mean i do i love sour cream and onion chips from america but if i had the option to pick between those two every time i would probably pick those absolutely they're really good dill pickle puffs last snack we have this big bag of dill pickle puffs see if it makes a green wow that is pickly that is strong i like almost like and um the balls are quite large wow like jungle i love pickles yeah these are huge definitely just like a regular cheese puff but it tastes like a cucumber i don't get pickle i got cucumber well it does say the number one spot for flavor goes to this and it says why while locals rely on pickled cucumbers tomatoes mushrooms and even watermelons to sustain them through the winter so maybe like they it's not fully pickled that would make sense because i'm not picking up on just straight like pickle it's a lot just if you were to go to your garden grab a cucumber and cut it up this is like cucumber and 34 pieces are 13 points so overall the points are a little bit high but if you only have a couple which i think would be satisfying seeing how large they are only a couple points so that concludes the russia box and believe it or not we have all greens except we both agreed on a single meh isn't that crazy like box was amazing there was literally nothing in this box that i would not eat like everything was just so good it makes me want to visit russia like imagine how their food and it's just like if their snacks are this good like you you guys must make food great it's amazing so let's do quickly the favorites um we'll vote as a team here so overall favorite kind of thing i'm going to say these croutons the darker ones you know what i'm i was trying to think between the wafer with like that really like the cream or these but i'm going to go with these they're amazing that was number okay and the worst yum i think the worst yum should probably be the only me um so that was this chocolate bar which had peanuts and hazelnuts it's very thick it's heavy um it just didn't wow us we weren't disappointed in it we just kind of and i feel like even saying the worst yum is strong but we have to put one down you know so it's gonna be the me and then the weirdest yum i don't know i feel like the one we just tried is pretty weird yeah i i would say that the pickle ones or the candy that you mix they were great i just thought it was a little weird how like kind of interesting i guess but i think i'm fine with going with i don't know the pickle ones they're odd they're very odd because they they weren't just straight pickled they like i don't know like yeah they were like i was expecting just a strong pickles i feel like in a previous box we tried something pickled as well and that gave me the pickle that was thinking and this was just cucumber right yeah so i agree with that number 20 for us all right there are no rejects this box last time every time actually they've told us ones that didn't make the cut um but this time they didn't do this they just kind of went over yums that are in the yum shop but let's vote on an upcoming box we have turkey jordan or israel i think i i'm totally seeing turkey and jordan um i'd probably say turkey personally just because i think it'd be a cool box to have but honestly they all sound really cool i go with turkey turkey let's do turkey all right guys and that concludes our box uh we hope you really enjoy this box as much as we did and we hope to see you soon on our next video [Music] bye [Music] you", "ZZ-P_YmFbE8": "hello everyone

"LRqohYJPLp0": "hi I'm Angie and this is the last part of my how you can make chocolate at home serious so if you want to learn how uros cacao beans we know them and temper chocolate go ahead and watch part 1 to 4 first I recognized that I gave you all the instructions of how you rose cacao beans at home or how you can temper your chocolate but I actually never told you where you can find cacao beans so this video is about where you can find your ingredients for basic chocolate you actually only need cacao beans and sugar I guess you don't even need sugar if you want to make 100% and dark chocolate but let's just say you want to add a little bit of sugar of course you can get tuber pretty much everywhere organic done organic you can also just replace sugar with turnips like stevia so I think we're good on the sugar part but where can you get cacao butter cacao beans and cacao nibs let's start with a to easier once the cacao butter and cacao nibs you can get cacao butter at Whole Foods or online for example on Amazon same with cacao nibs you can give either nibs and at Trader Joe's and Safeway you can also get them at Whole Foods you can get them on my website as well or Amazon it's getting a little bit more difficult if we're talking cacao beans usually you won't find any cacao beans at a store and the most important part if you want to make a high-quality chocolate your also need high quality beans i source my organic cacao beans and add chocolate alchemy let's take a closer look this is the chocolate alchemy website if you want to learn things about chocolate you need to go here they have a great block where you can find just everything about chocolate and they have a shop section the retail section in our case with cocoa beans you know their cocoa beans they carry and the nice thing about it they also have flavor profiles so you can choose whatever you like and are also giving you instructions and characteristics some details roasting so yeah great page to visit and the nice thing is they also have nips are the ingredients they also carry cocoa butter now you are covered to make chocolate at home and I would love to see your results share some pictures with me on Instagram or leave a comment in the comment section and I mean yeah if you liked the video hit the subscribe button and follow me on Instagram bye", "ZtMfiWDQHT8": "[Music] this factory makes chocolate in various forums and sells it to companies which manufacture chocolate products for retail sale it also supplies chocolate components such as cocoa powder and cocoa butter most of the coca beans arriving here come from West Africa which grows 70% of the world's crop a conveyor belt moves them through a cleaning system a series of SIVs that screen out twigs stones and other debris next stop is a micronized revolving drum that heats the coca beans to loosen their shells then they enter a shell removing machine called a winnower inside successive rakes drag the beans across screens pulling off large pieces of shell then a vacuum sucks away the remaining smaller pieces removing the shell exposes the inside of the coca bean which is called the nib the factory will roast the nibs to develop their flavour 50 plus percent of the nib is fat which is cocoa butter to make chocolate they'll combine processed nibs cocoa butter and sugar along with milk powder if they're making milk chocolate first the factory processes the nibs by grinding them the heat and friction activate the cocoa butter producing pure liquid chocolate called chocolate liqueur the factory extract some of the cocoa butter to sell it separately as chocolate making ingredient and to use for in-house chocolate production along with other ingredients in various proportions the dark chocolate recipe for example calls for more chocolate liqueur sugar and cocoa butter but no milk powder the recipe for unsweetened chocolate contains no sugar the mixer blends the ingredients to the consistency of a very thick cake batter the flavor is fine by this point but the coarse texture needs to be smoothed out so the chocolate moves to a refining machine passing between a set of five rollers that reduce the particle size so much so that within just minutes the chocolate leaves the refiner as a fine dry powder but now it needs to be real iqua fide so the next stop is a machine called a conch the friction and heat once again activate the cocoa butter returning the powder to a liquid state at this point they add more cocoa butter enough to reduce the viscosity to the exact thickness they need just a bit for example if they're making chocolate chips or much more if they're making a thin chocolate coating for chocolate chips the conch feeds a machine called a drop depositor as the name implies it deposits drops of chocolate onto a conveyor belt the nozzle trays are interchangeable so the machine can be set up to produce various sizes of chips discs or other shapes the chocolate chips still warm and soft enter a cooling tunnel traveling for about five minutes through several temperature zones which vary between thirty and fifty degrees Fahrenheit by the time the chips exit the tunnel they're hard a conveyor belt then takes them through a metal detector a standard food safety precaution the factory also produces 10-pound ball format chocolate bars but depositor fills bar shaped plastic molds the conveyer transfers them to an elevator system which moves through a cold room for about two hours this constant motion ensures optimal air circulation helping the cooling process", "q8FRO9nTQOU": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying all candy bars these are from Josh the Berkshire bacon lover in Massachusetts three of these candy bars are milk chocolate and one is dirt truck what they are made by big why and actually they are made in Canada no that's wrong yeah Springfield Merrill they are made in Canada tributon distributed I'm back did I read that wrong yes their remaining handed them now call I can read back so I have a milk chocolate almond bar a dark chocolate milk chocolate with crisp rice and milk chocolate just a bar just why don't we just trying to play no milk chocolate bars oh how many calories is what thank you oh we should have done that got in the calculator so we could see how much each pieces it is 310 calories if you eat the entire thing but I'm thinking it's probably in yet therefore 687 310 so 30 31 calories per square okay they're just all talk truffle I'm only going to half of that we do the next one we saved these when we do were these two reviews I don't what you think with why step we said these for later when we have snacks and you know we'll put in a ziplock baggie and then we get it all out that's out time it's not spectacular okay it's an okay chocolate it's not strong it doesn't have a strong part no our my job Palmer drama what's up LM one of those Ramona that's whenever Easter candy that's what everyone's job is Easter like your big Hollow Easter Bunny you know yes that's the that's a good job now this a murder this is gonna be like a French bar this is like so 310 Hill I know talking with Ross prison wife do you take a half an arrow I will have close-up pictures it's basically the same thing that what cut slice yeah the buggers not any different no it's just a texture thing yeah those little crust crispy crunchy pieces in there I like that better I did too it actually tastes a little sweeter yeah it did I don't know what I did to meet you know I guess the cereal miss Peter yeah that tastes sweeter than just the regular about Java that's so weird it still tastes like he's a jock but that is so much better no it was better than perfect this one is milk chocolate almond and it is 320 calories so 10 more calories but you get almonds okay them you can definitely taste the almonds yeah whole crisp in there okay that's my favorite yeah mine too so far because you really really added to get any crunch of the nut later was kind of it was like the flavor was there then I saw it but there was no later yeah there was no crunch to it at all but I love up like damn good flavor this is a very like chocolate but yeah but that one has destroys larvae or something okay now this is dark chocolate so this would be really interesting this one is only three entertained gallery so three of them were 310 and the ones with the necklace 320 mixes and it is dog hmm no absolutely like that you probably done and it really tasted like honking I think that taste hmm I got an after Oswald it has that special dark mm-hmm Blackwell to it very much it's not super bitter but it definitely is a dark rock yes it's definitely dark Rob but it has its it's like the Hershey's special dark I what every would remind you of crisper than that though yeah soft but yeah I like the crystal but yeah I really do like that texture that's almost the texture of when you buy it and Walmart in the banking out and you want to get the baking bars in the banking bars that's the texture of that it's the texture of a baking bar but my favorite is still the almond my haunted so that was that was really really good well I'll have pictures of all four of these at the end I I hope you enjoy them nobody from Canada had ever sent to me these and so it was pretty cool that Josh sent me something from Massachusetts from Canada that was made in Canada so thanks for watching", "PrmZyyRU4-w": "well I never thought I'd have to bring my at the pen on shoot but here we are hey babes Jeff's here and today we are taking on who chocolate or Hugh Hugh human chocolate is a primal vegan organic house ground cacao chocolate brand and they become kind of popular in like the primal paleo keto thing I am not sure what to make of the word primal related to chocolate I kind of bothers me given than a lot of chocolates from you know equatorial countries Africa South Central America the idea here is that it's like all the good things no gluten no refined sugar no cane sugar no sugar alcohols no dairy no GMOs no most fighters and no soy lecithin they had me the nose soya lecithin at least we'll be trying out three today they are straight up dirt chocolate crunchy mint dark and the almond butter and puffed quinoa but before I try these guys I must ask you awesome peeps at those like and subscribe buttons for more chocolate goodness as we dive in I feel like I should mention that there's a couple things here that caught me immediately one is that when I see the words stone-ground I immediately assume that it's gonna be a very soft bar and very crumbly do the weirder thing is from the ingredients this bar the almond butter bar on the very back says contains less than 2% of cashew and hazelnut it's an almond bar and so for that reason I've got my EpiPen right here is we are not messing around with hazelnut thank you very much so this is kind of a convenient tasting in that really all three use the same percentage they're all a 70% dark chocolate but they don't even tell you where the chocolates from you put in all this effort for all this transparency about all of the things going on and also if you're not including but you don't tell me where your chocolates from that's odd it just thank you as in human the leaves I know I how to pronounce it I feel like I should mention that these guys are chuh from two different orders I picked this guy up from lollipops a few days ago and these guys are from Whole Foods so I'm gonna give this one a little bit of leniency because it's older I got it on sale well let's try some I'm gonna start with dark chocolate and in addition to the Epson I got some water because we're gonna need it okay so apparently they have a restaurant that they're advertising for that's a new one looking at this bar itself it is a very thick bar yep from old up I want this like half this thickness oh my goodness it's I mean this is a good amount of chocolate actually for your money I think this highways they were six dollars each which is on the lower end for crack chocolate it smells kind of musty actually yeah there's kind of a musty coffee note to it but let's let's try it so is this slow melt and more smooth than I expected rather bitter rather sour bitter there is a buttery note to it and it's more creamy than I normally expect out of the stone-ground bars in fact I was expecting to have way more of a great to the mouthfeel it's both very creamy and bitter sour kind of almost a raisin slash wine note yeah this is one weird want to eat it in slivers first or number two there's a cute this has those cacao nibs in here mentioned separately from the cacao it does it's crunchy mint chocolate so I'm guessing they'll have the crunch from the cacao nibs and then it has peppermint oil so I'm expecting to have like a really intense burst of peppermint and then some crunch oh whoa it smells like an Andes mint in here totally Andes mints and now you can really see the nibs to me this looks like a softer temper too like I can see almost flakes in the chocolate which is really interesting and I can kind of see the counted sticking out there doing their thing let's try this so it's like in an easement with that again that sour-cream erased you know from the 70% I want more nibs in this I won't work French and I'm really wondering where they're getting their chocolate from now I feel like I want a Madagascar chocolate there wasn't like a berry punch not a spicy note the peppermint needs to shine last not least we got ourselves the almond butter and puffed quinoa now again this is an older bar it is not expired but the other ones expire like summer next year and this one expires in January so it has been sitting on the shelves longer and maybe I should regret that I mean even through the packaging here you can see the beginnings of that bloom it's when the fats start separating and they become that white stuff on top this is fat bloom it can make stuff taste really bland and chalky you can salvage stuff by making you know hot chocolate though thanks good hot chocolates does not usually make for a good chocolate bar smells really spicy though but completely different smell from the other two maybe just was just a different batch yeah almost like cinnamon nutty this guy has massive fat bloom and as you can see the almond butter is crumbling apart my hands whoa so the inside fell apart on my clothing which is so great but it's a really interesting chance to see the inside of this bar I do not consider this to be representative of hue now because it is so fat wound and so separated it does concern me though that a bar that has not expired and won't expire for well over a month look like this let's try anyway to see what's going on here well it's drying crumbly with kind of a soft on butter note and it has trashed me and my clothing dealing with the bars or the proportions kind of make sense there's a fair amount of almond butter in there I would have liked more quinoa personally from what I was seeing but it looked like it made some sense like it felt like it would be a hearty snack also very glad I don't have to use the EpiPens and do it okay wish my skirt wasn't covered in almond butter crumbs so that's that's for sure all right so my thoughts on hue I feel like what they're trying to do is bring chocolate to people who are scared to use processed sugar which is totally reasonable like you're reducing processed sugar from that life the only major option right now is to go for eating cacao beans or 100% cacao chocolate which are both delicious but it's harder to find good bars on the major markets this feels like they were trying to bring Whole Foods a more allergy friendly option in the under nine dollar range which is a really good price for craft chocolate my main issue besides being covered in chocolate is that I want to be more out of it I would like to be a bit more of a shareable bar I think the almond butter is not user friendly today that it was was still a really good idea and I'd like to see more of that from them actually like that's felt like a really good like after workout snack possibility and I think that would be a really cool way to see craft chocolate and snacking chocolate evolve if it could be something that's allergy friendly and snackable the people of more ages because a lot of craft chocolate it's dark and it's full sugar if it's sweet enough for the mainstream person to start on it like I think there's something here and I'm glad that they're working with coconut sugar I'm excited to see more options I still want to know where they're getting their chocolate from so with that I would love to hear from you in those comments below have you tried a huge chocolate how'd it go which one did you try I actually didn't try all of them there's a banana chocolate I don't normally like banana chocolate so I skip that one so I would love to hear your thoughts and with that I'll get you tomorrow", "GTvJqMY7gnA": " Luxury chocolate bars i buy it from Amazon its contains 24 bars it is so

macro coaching but i never talk about it so i wanted to talk about it um we just do macro coaching so if you're interested in losing weight and you got some fitness goals hit us up my email her email it'll be in the description all right let's get to the review oh [ __ ] it's backwards there we go there we go there we go yeah yeah so this shit's called muscle chef with two fs muscle chef and this is hazelnut protein spread white chocolate and regular hazelnut chocolate and cocoa what was it no no it's coco oh coco or coco coco anyways anyways um this stuff's on amazon so i was on my amazon next thing you know i'm like protein spreads and i'm like what the [ __ ] and i seen that this was um i seen that this was on amazon but i've never seen it before so i was like all right what is it so the price point on this bad boy is um i think it's twelve dollars for two pack so it's six dollars a piece not expense not expensive at all but guess what it doesn't have amazon prime so you have to pay for shipping which kind of sucks because if you had amazon prime you can get this for twelve dollars at six dollars a piece after shipping that's pretty fair but the delivery was like 5.99 so this end up being like 18 or 19 for a two pack which is about the same price point as like the bomar butters and everything else like ten dollars better get some stuff while you're shopping pretty much like you got to make it worth it unfortunately so and we'll let you know if it's worth it yeah so um yeah so that is the price point so the macros is the same 180 calories you have 13 fat you got eight carbs three fiber six sugar and seven grams protein and you're probably asking yourself where is this where's this stuff made it says country origin of turkey so this was made in turkey this isn't the european european lady you could tell it's got a european label it's got um yeah it's got a european label it's definitely interesting yeah it's different languages where's the ingredients at oh it's right there uh whey protein is the protein source and what sugar sweetener they use actually it's super basic sugar beet you use some sugar beet action that's it it's actually pretty basic what's yours pretty basic pretty basic whey protein hazelnut hazelnut vegetable white chocolate cocoa skim milk sugar beet lots of thinner vanilla flavoring so it's pretty basic so all made without lard all right yeah so we're gonna bust it open okay texture is on the point definitely like a i like it i don't know what it what would you call this texture oh it's like uh is it almost like the real deal it looks like to be like wow it's uh everyone saw the spoon enough uh yeah but it's pretty interesting like i like it look at that boom there you go do the haze on that first side apparently hazelnut first you're a big fan of um nutella right i do the real stuff boom definitely can't tell that there's any protein in there you can't tell no way no no way no way got jokes up in this place it almost tastes like chocolate pudding oh yes is that what it tastes like to you except a little bit more more denser more dense obviously with the texture but i would say it's got like a chocolate pudding feel as far as it tastes i mean it's got cocoa so that's where we're getting the chocolate but i love this yeah better than bulmar no better than walmart the texture is better than bulmar but the taste is better boomer that's what i'm saying the taste it depends because bulmar has like a marshmallow type of taste yeah it does and this is more like the real deal i would say as far as the texture this is the white one very similar very similar i think this might be a little bit more denser than the actually yeah it is it's like it won't give it all it's like you scoop it and it's there it's not going anywhere anytime soon like so anyways there's the white chocolate one that's a big spoon just do a little lick a little lick white chocolate hazelnut i didn't know that was a thing by the way that's just straight up pure white chocolate sugar not mad not mad yeah it tastes like white chocolate just straight up white chocolate that's games as you can tell she likes it it tastes like white chocolate it's really good with protein i think they're doing some [ __ ] over there at turkey i think they're doing some turkey actually now they're both contaminated they don't matter so what are you thinking i'm okay giving them the same mom ratings yeah same rings hmm it's really just like a white chocolate spread like let me look up nutella's actual flavor michaels because i don't know nutella's macros well for one it does have a decent amount of fat well it's nuts what did you expect yeah it's only got seven protein so it's not crazy bummer has like ten but for what it is it's not bad i really like him i forgot i don't have service down here so let's hope yeah you ain't got no service down here nutella 200 uh calories it's got 12 grams of fat same fat it's got 21 grams of sugar holy [ __ ] and then 2 grams of protein so there's less carbs way less carbs than this and more way less carbs same three three of the carbs are fiber here yeah so i think for what it is it's like super solid super solid yeah the cocoa it's a very big contender to the nutella like bulmar is its own thing it doesn't line up with nutella this one actually does i agree but i do like the bowmer one i do like it it's super soft it's like a thought it's so good so is this one it's good it is it's something the texture difference is totally different i think for the price point they're actually on point right yeah i suggest that i suggest them um ratings you got something yeah i think you're that looks like 10. i could see it in her eyes i think ready three two one nine yeah i'm giving it a nine it's pretty solid it's beautiful she likes it i like it she doesn't like things a lot so i would take this one as a good suggestion beautiful cultural check it out check it out on amazon guys check it out beautiful white chocolate straight or white chocolate can't even tell there's protein that's ganging that's coming that's good coming from her because she's always like it's got a protein taste or something hey in this day and age things you know 20 21 now it's 20 21 it should be mashed up by now yeah i don't want to taste no protein we're not back in the 80s yeah all right shit's growing i'm bringing that portion back shit's been growing since then so 100 hope you guys enjoyed this video if you guys tried these out let me know what the [ __ ] you think in the comment section

names and we try them out this was a milk hazelnut and it is 100 of 220 calories for the entire bar I'm on board now I'm just gonna break off you don't want to hold these thing you know just try kept the thing in the hamper it's a if it's a nut it's gonna be difficult for you you know this one says it is actually read it sorry milk chocolate with hazelnut filling and whole hazelnuts good I really enjoyed it the milk chocolate was very light though didn't have a strong flavor to it at all the hazelnut however was strong it was a very powerful hazelnut so to speak but if you're looking for you know my candy bar that's not gonna punch in the teeth it's okay I'm I was expecting like nut tallow strong but it wasn't nearly that strong so it's good it's just not I don't know about Bobby him this one's the dark hazelnut and this one is milk chocolate with hazelnut filling in tour this is dark chocolate with hazelnut filling and whole Halon so it's basically the same thing except dark talk well they did this one here feeling yeah this one is 230 calories for the bar yeah I think that's the most out of the stick and you get three of these little they look like garlic don't know man look like a little closer garlic this is lint is there I don't see the filling they stuck in net well I guess it is a little lighter colored the inside it's kind of lame - oh please breathe pretty light on my dark chocolate banana and that's not strong enough no and I hate darkroom I don't mind that one so much little Hershey's special dark it's okay which is not great once again they're pegging the hazelnut they're tagging it you can tell they're replacing that's they're really good the chocolate they're using is just not strong all right now these two you know these next three I'm excited well those are kind of hot in the hazelnut regions well milk chocolate with a hazelnut cream filling and pieces of almond brittle so this one looks like and this one is 190 calories how much were all these these were a dollar they were a dollar fifty one has a nine I don't think you said the nine presto presto presto yeah this was just a little indentions on the bar and I get some credit and that one had five right you can what you see here sold yeah that one had only nothing you're gonna see inside there it's not like the picture okay yeah the picture chosen all crunchy and looks like a granola bar inside of it fixed this is chocolate has a little piece of a crunch somewhere now there's a crunch otherwise flavor especially for that much money I mean that's expensive for candy bar is really all right yeah so once I mean I did get kind of uh normally hints right there thinking and then I liked the taste it's remaining but it wasn't there while I was eating them it needed that have more of that crunchy stuff in there honestly okay so this is the lint wafer and it is milk chocolate with wafer and creamy hazelnut filling definitely getting a hazelnut theme here now I know this is the one you waiting for that now um yeah it's 190 calories for the entire bars to the you man I'm away you know once he just got to the chubby bunny Lord and mercy now this one does sound like it has heavy betting here's this better than that one looks like it has a little bit of up that's a little bit of a crunch so how much okay exactly what this next one you have your very bland milk chocolate that we've come to expect from Lin so far today and they wafer on the inside there's these little cheap vanilla wafer bars little cookies so they look little cookies and you get them in a brick and they're like a dollar that's what's next like yeah I love those I think they're awesome little sugar but yellowish colored and they got a cream in yet another yellow always color cookie that's what he's talking about they are they're always cheap they're sold as the store where Andy usually yeah I love them we call those oh I like that it's not Brazil oh no it's still pretty light flavor though all right pull that out because I've eaten so much I buy them all the time and they don't sell you the chocolate wafers solo we have to buy like a try yeah this one's the double milk this one I'm scared of its milk chocolate with a creamy milk filling and it is 220 calories for tomorrow it's divided up in the little bumps again you can see that the cream the Korean you don't get that one on Sammy you can pretty much see what you're dealing with no actually that's a flag it doesn't last very long there that is white cream candy would you divinity would you put that close to a mild Henry yes Kadri crewneck down the little bit yeah the the cream reminds me of divinity if you've ever had to venom a kind of do that the texture reminds me the baby yeah you're right doesn't for me it reminds me of a Cadbury but not but without the real strong Cadbury flavor that you're probably sweet yeah oh man it is sweet that is the strongest flavor one out of the bunch though it is good but I wouldn't buy any of them again honestly I went by Ennio they just that for the calories you get you just don't have that flavor I mean I'll take your Snickers yeah Snickers pink Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I mean something like that you get the same calories for a cheaper price and maybe it's not as high-quality as chocolate but the flavor is definitely much better probably because you know artificially they know what they're doing they gotta give it to you you", "kigIDmZnEgE": "all right what's going on we're back at it with another seasonal bar i mean pretty excited for this uh this is uh from

brewed with cocoa nibs and vanilla this is from a beta brewing company just hit the market this week introducing 2021 available in these bottles 12 ounce stubby neck bottles and on draft produced by a bee to brewing abito springs louisiana fashion from a classic new orleans dessert our chocolate doughbears cake stout is layered with sweet cocoa nibs vanilla and milk sugar to create a rich and decadent sweetness with velvety chocolate notes they're trying to make it taste like a dobash cake which is the different layers each layer filled with chocolate pudding and then the chocolate icing on the outside and then lemon pudding also like chocolate lemon chocolate lemon kind of weird cake which everybody loves uh 15 ibus 8 alcohol willamette hops flavored stout okay there's your disclosure brewed and bottled bottle bob this chase snifter is one of the glasses to use also a tumbler and a chalice no sediment this is the first video review for this product in the world it's not listed on beer advocate in rapier or rapier and it only has 29 chickens on untappd dark brown with the light shining through it the dim overcast light still dark brown okay so dark brown a khaki head imperial stout avita likes to do a lot of eight percent beers a few tens but a lot of eight a lot of eight all right i guess it smells like that doughbear's cake icing that rich it's not dark chocolate like rich buttery chocolate vanilla chocolate vanilla infused chocolate a little bit of that pudding that you get in the middle no lemon though but there's different ways to construct a bears dobash cake and seem like everybody's that i eat is different from the other but they're all good there's some youtube videos about how to make a dobash cake and um you can look at those it's just having a heavy nose of dessert chocolate dessert cake pudding cake vanilla the taste somebody asked me today do you like i heard you you said nobody say you said you didn't really like flavored beers i don't really it's not something i look for it's not my first choice but how do you review beers these days without doing flavor ones some are like this kind of interesting with the chocolate some are usually kind of disgusting they taste like jolly ranchers and other assorted candies which it's like standard malt not really dark malt um some cocoa nibs they're saying coconuts like you would get in the baker's section of a grocery store to cook with nibs whatever brand vanilla extract dough bash i don't know about that um not that different from the breckenridge vanilla but at eight percent stronger um i still have the blue moon mango wheat i've got three of each i think i have to drink a can in bottle you heard i said have to drink you know what i mean like i'll drink them i was looking for keystone ice yesterday in the fridge day before yesterday and i was like i'm out well i said well let me just get through these so that's that's kind of like my attitude toward the flavor beers like i'll get through it even though they might score in the a's like 8 96 something but i just don't like them and then compound that on wheat beer which i don't like but the blue moon did score 87 b this is good and it has that abita house malt style which i can't describe really but um it's like a pale malt similar to samuel adams spears when you taste their beers they all kind of taste the same because they almost always start off invariably with that two-row pale malt blend a beta has that too and then they just like change the flavors up with their base i guess a lot of companies do that um this is sort of late to the party in a way because a lot of these similar tastes and products been on the market for a good good while the trader joe's [Music] chocolate stout it's only five point oh five point something it's dry stout comes in the can six pack six pack of cans for 4.99 they've improved it used to be really dry and kind of bad flavor now it's improved but it's similar kind of similar to this in a way and like i said the breckenridge and some other you say what about young's double chocolate um yeah it's the same type thing same type thing same type thing um is this worse than those new is it better i wouldn't say it's really better it's just in the mix it's fine i don't know how many louisiana people have had chocolate stouts seem like if they're into the beer the beer culture you know they would try have tried the samuel smith's or ganic chocolate stout which probably nobody can beat i guess uh the youngs which is very good especially in the nitro can better in the nitro king um the breckenridge which i only have seen in houston on road trips i don't know i've seen it around here around here um one more sip i'll give this a score the body is a little thin almost into a porter you say eight percent into a porter imperial style strange a lot of beta beers are strange they're like kind of like not quite in line with the style um the finish is semi-sweet semi-sweet so my sweet it's got a cola-like appearance it's a well if you added some you know what it tastes kind of like if they added some chili pepper would be the joker veza type thing what do they call those things the mole it's kind of like that kind of like that so sort of a thin mouthfeel watery three out of five sugar cubes on cyclops scale one out of five hopkins so the bitterness doesn't really play a part here i'll give it a 90 it's just touching excellent a minus so i mean 229 a bottle for a single to check it out yeah it's worth it i mean i don't know if i'd buy a six pack depending on the price if it was 10.99 i wouldn't buy a six pack no matter what the price i wouldn't want to drink uh six of these but maybe to share them with people and say what do y'all think of course most of the people i know that drink beer would say i don't want that i want real beer give me bud light that's what they would say they would they would just say i don't drink garbage like that you know and i'm not i'm not exaggerating but anyway it's uh it's it's okay it's another novelty product and that's what we're swamped with to a large extent but um that's the world in which we live so le laisse le bonton relay 90 out of 100 who who could complain about 90 out of 100 i'm not going to and i'm going to end this review by saying yeah go to abita

probably the absolute worst chocolate I've ever had in my entire life I'm not even gonna I'm not even gonna eat any more of it on camera for you guys I'm just not gonna put myself through it so what they're trying to go for here is the milk chocolate bar itself was red velvet and inside you really can't see from that yeah there you go this little cream cheese bits cream cheese frosting bits it just red velvet has such a unique flavor and I like red velvet cake a lot I remember when red velvet became a big thing nationwide it was like a it was like a southern treat for a while and you know us northerners we really weren't too used to read in velvet and I think was like Paula Deen or something started making red velvet cakes or whatever my mother was making red velvet cakes for a while and we were all really liking them red velvet cake is delicious I think originally you made it with like beet juice or something or vinegar but it has a very distinct flavor a very unique flavor and it just does not translate well to this at all this is absolute trash I do not recommend this one bit stay the hell away from it it is garbage it tastes like it tastes like because in milk chocolate form that red velvet taste can't be recreated the way it can and like a cake or a cookie or a muffin or cupcake or something like that it just doesn't work you're not even gonna say it's a noble effort from these people because these candy bars are actually fairly expensive like the only reason why I bought it was because it was a weird flavor and I do the I do the YouTube videos regardless I probably would have stayed the hell away from it yeah so with that said don't bother with Dylan's Candy Bar red velvet milk chocolate bar because it is just and I counted this as a as a Valentine's Day thing because it had hearts on it so I'm within I'm within bounds to post this video as a Valentine's Day treat so you better off eating those little chalky those little chalky candy hearts with stupid sayings on them that would put those things probably tastes better than than this so stay the hell away from from Dylan's Candy Bar red velvet", "zAieR-oimX8": "hello Kelsey Taylor here but this we cease to spew I'm gonna do something a bit different and kind of quick on the other day I was a Dollar Tree getting some food and I got these Twix of course these are the regular Twix some candies on the milk chocolate and this one I don't remember if I had or not um Twix white I'm like these are the white chocolate ones and I'm gonna actually compare which these are better the milk chocolate or the white chocolate now I personally like them both but which one's the best I'm gonna try out the boys first I kept them in the fridge to keep them cool because God forbid if I place this somewhere in this apartment where it's gonna get very warm they're gonna melt I think much better and I think I've seen the white chocolate or somewhere maybe I haven't I don't know I'm sure they did out quite a while all right let me try the milk of course I had trucks before I've always liked these so but I was gonna do it just a regular taste test view on these and I realized maybe pointless so I just saw shake things up a bit here's yep usually tasty but Corsican what's frozen because I had it in the fridge for a day or two I know so much chocolate no it's hard to swallow hard caramel latest two different web place them in the fridge try to figure out what to say um I'm sure if there if you don't place them on the first this one me more have a better taste well this one I think maybe if I'm true off this shell bar here Oh [Music] I think maybe the test is which one's better in the core bridge what do they taste like um I'm sure the white chocolate twits are kind of good but like maybe if I just take one little bite see I have a big appetite I just junk it - you would like pac-man bigger bites because I was such a big appetite let me share this - the milk chocolate Oh see I taste more the flavor in the chocolate one want then the white once so so I can understand if you don't like white chocolate that much the milk chocolate staff Lee kind of better because that's more of a taste to it especially when it's cool when you put it in the refrigerator um the white chocolate ones it's fine so I don't know um like which do you prefer you prefer white chocolate or milk chocolate like these ones are definitely worth picking up like what just happened dry and stuff but don't like if you want like you really experience the taste of white chocolate then don't put these in the fridge I think that was a big mistake here but um I think the milk chocolates the best my tastes were cool um I don't know maybe the white chalk was born lighter or something so that's just a little quick random taste test video just something a bit different and um let me know what you think of this and um I'll have this video post up later well by the time this up you're seeing it but me I don't know what I'm gonna put it up so anyway thank you so much for watching I'll catch you guys next time adios", "iEvytir9YxA": "yesterday at Target I bought two new

really like is that what it's called Nestle's Quik yeah the strawberry milk if you've ever bought that I prefer the chocolate better but you're not a dark chocolate person thank you yeah definitely strawberry milk they're both very very good and I would buy them both again you", "vtHAzMYHjyc": "chocolate [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] wanna come", "F2Z_hrIXAtY": "[Music] hello everyone I talk about it for no video review this time we have the new coverage white with Oreo yes I guess it was only a matter of time basically I'm Kevin we've just relaunched this for the white chalk arrange and you should be called cabbies dream now when don't fees exactly the same bar some lots of people or some people Lisa saying that it's not um yeah so basically did well this is a bear take on that one with Oreo so they've got like it seems like a blank check to do anything you want with we've Oreo really Limon delays your own Cadbury this of half the year the rife story or whatever so basically you'll see with Calgary products and milk of products it's just Oreo everywhere so yes but I don't know it was by at least ten are your products in the can be Ranger thank em yeah so we're there we can come as only a milk ones as well so yes there we are so this so basically yep they've just thrown some Oreo pieces into their cubbies white box so these are Soria pieces let's see what does he say mister see on the front creamy white chocolate Oreo on the back which is probably well get better description white chocolate with vanilla flavor filling 20% and biscuit pieces fourteen percent so it's got that vanilla flavor fee and that worries me but you can't seat on the frontier and you see that vanilla flavor filling I am NOT a fan of it at all it's a weird cream taste that we get some of these chocolate bars and there's one there's one Kabri products I think's called the Cadbury I don't know it's a cool Oreo Oreo son we just something that something is called and basically it's just got mini Oreos inside the barn and one of the you know Oreos crispy nosing down there it's like this I'm sure you probably do know but it's this biscuit here especially a bit of the dark top of Biscay I must say with a cream filling a little bit you know sandwich between and a layer of dark chocolate biscuit and basically yeah what they did was in this covery sandwich thing he just rinse out these mini Oreos inside the boss of one of the layers in the biscuit was actually accomplished chocolate that felt fed through from the from the chocolate that was perfect cause it was an Oreo biscuit with chocolate whereas these sort of vanilla cream filling things is just nothing I mean it's not really even the same flavor or taste as the audio cream filling I know it might have done it to try and make simulated our beliefs but it isn't except white feeling now on the biscuit you know so it's Billy I'm disappointing real Sam I'm already worried about this but so there we go okay so we're mocking us so per bar for one grams 2027 calories 13 grams of fats 7.4 et Cetera's super widget Aryans made under license from Cadbury UK Limited passionates are going to achieve you're not happy so the Queen's symbol I'll always mention mr. Queen symbol Queen approves must be a fun of that cream filling I don't think you see it I can't quite see where it is on the okay don't really know what it means I mean there's some products varying from food to the emergency equipment and also has finished oil symbols is that pinched as long and then Katie probably did have one baby yes there we go interesting was it Prince Andrew Prince Andrew sorry doctor isn't this clear it was fine it was fine it's time does that turn recording Edward is fine okay mmm so we up yeah Stoney dry place presenter meets four bosses but yeah so you just come in as a four bar pack I'm not seeing it sold separately so this is four individual bars this so when I was giving you the nutrition is reaching before is for one of the bars in this pack so ago so it looks quite nice I quite like the package here feels good I've been I quite like the company white packaging I like the there's the whites of beige creamy color cream coughing on page here was quite nice folks these new as well so we got this new thing here fault pack there it's okay yes sir give it open mm-hmm okay let's do it let's hope I'm sense it in the camera Carly sighs very hard when I hope ma'am let's give this an open yes oh nice try and open them perfectly you know you should do this thing to do is difficult though because everything like this okay so there we go so you got four of these bars so full of these uh quite nice that's nothing it's a yeah look at that stuffing Alice quite nice place trophy hmm so the purpose of the year the showing on it with the regular packaging houses squiggly sexy so you can see this packaging quite soft shiny so on this side you know question you this one's a bit more dual bit more matte hmm yeah you know me don't forget tell in the camera buddy in hand ie so Chicana it gives it a bit of a darker look to it hmm doesn't make you know you know been honed yet yes sir nice first bit different so mm-hmm obviously so it looks just to be like the yeah the regular cab er er one it's got like funny it's a segmented bar the segment seems to be a funny shape massive flourishes on here as well let's measure it sir with the flourishes so yeah it's about 40 not centimetres I think you big long rushing but 14 we seven yeah yeah so you see what I mean so we need to squeeze the power off it's a lot smaller yes I says yeah water pipe ball not for resale so we can see the outer pack so in a dry place this is a cool dry place this is driving now percent from heat well Jim generally this like a cool dry place so this one said he white chocolate with Oreo it says yes that's quite a happy I was good the other purple either way it's not a metallic purple white very shiny purple hmm okay so it's giving it open so we said fourteen point seven centimeters I'll see what that's changed to make it open okay well it looks very nice actually yeah it looks very nice you can see it's got a nice bubbly chocolate look that Cadbury's de menthe bars do quite like actually Sam I think overall there's some controversy about C because I think it would end up being smaller to a weight or whatever and then having the Regulus of like rectangles square blocks whatever used to be the squat as you can see the Oreo filling those well are your biscuit pieces hmm it's got some kind of a nice white chocolate smoke away from it it's got some kind of swirl on it as well though you can make it out it was like a pattern on that bubble as well so it's very hard to make out that I don't know if you can tell there is one there you see that highlights it maybe hello there is a swirl on that Hey okay so 40.7 we said centimeters let's see what it is now twelve he lost yeah that's two point seven centimeters there which is ridiculous really and the width from tip to tip about 3.2 people nor five and height about 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.4 hard to tell yeah because it's not flat at the side yeah okay you know what's interesting it's quite nice mmm-hmm let's go to build a snap okay so you're interesting hmm okay so it's a says cream fillings is filled with all your pieces it looks a bit more interesting than me do it lots to be crying chock-full of pieces actually I'm quite interesting hmm yes from might actually work you know it's full of pieces now that's really good I'm sure they've won their the regular Kabri Oreo one isn't none isn't quite as full as this no when the thing that might mean that the cream thing is not quite as dominant and that should be a better from memory anyway so it could be wrong with him know that sometimes these bars you just have like a literally a layer of cream and there's nothing in it where's this one that says full of chocolate Oreo so hmm I am there yeah just around us now as we worried but soon yeah let's say I mean just looking at this full of Oreo yes that's what we want isn't it really hmm yeah I'm excited okay let's give it a taste okay all right ready to taste this chock-full of Oreo pieces and Oreo bars ever see so yeah then we can see they're chock full yes sir give it a go mmm hmm-hmm no bother too much mm-hmm better this there's a good amount of are you in there as I said I don't know whether maybe they know more the regular Cadbury Dairy overvalue is exchanged to have lots more Oreo in there but there's a good amount of are you in here me that means that the cream isn't the prominent taste and cuz I cream is a bit too creamy you know it's just a bit rubbish really on its own but with this hmm hmm hmm well I know G tasty are your biscuits as well because it contrasts pretty well some more so I'd say probably than the the milk chocolate so the white chalk them to get that's a lovely white chocolate taste hmm you know is there cross-section this is quite full it's got quite a good filling in them relatively small white chocolate it's the casing but not too bad picking off special on the top hmm yeah no I think this ratio is pretty much spot-on hmm hmm I mean the creams not perfect it's still the weakest part of it I mean but it's the white chocolate gives it a good they could taste as well I quite term mmm that's a nice it's the white chocolate works in this case some people have I enjoyed the new cabbie whypark and then sometimes the white hope it has tasted a bit chemically in some instances I have experience but um no no there's no way yeah I can't taste that at all here it tastes very nice hmm hmm mr. process on the table you can see it's almost solid REO pieces that really that's really good that's just how it should be and I think that's what the problem has been in the path of these Oreo makes it you know where we just been all about the cream and not the actual Oreo biscuit which is the best part hmm hmm still basically yeah um I guess at times like this one that this side seems to do a bit less full of REO pieces but I think you know seems to be an exception rather than the norm hmm this is mean that's me if you love white chocolate you definitely it that hit here within your pieces as well taste of Oreo you know it's not just all that cream filling that doesn't really taste about because that's not it's not the same cream as knowing as an Oreo yeah I never seemed to me anyway what it was I don't think it's a part you want from the Oreo I think it's you won that song dark chocolate biscuit really hmm now I think this works really well finger got the ratios just spot-on from he can really get the oreo taste I don't think the cream is the Oreo taste for me it's more the biscuit with the Queen compliments in the biscuit so which is what you get here then you said understand I think the white chocolate works well because it doesn't interact in a way that muddies the the taste between the biscuit and the cream and the chocolate we just it really worked well this is really good I'm surprised I was expecting to not really be too keen on this hmm plus it's pretty lots of too much cream sensor not enough REO and I'm not really a great white chocolate but erm yeah it's a set at least the white chocolate you know it doesn't move not really working very well but yet hmm no miss very good I think um hmm you still say the it's too much cream so nothing Yukino me a biscuit it's not as we've noticed there's a relatively quite a lot of cream in the middle of an obviously it's not the prominent taste and it doesn't over over it doesn't overshadow the ever taste of the biscuit it's not gotten much of a taste of us this one it's a bit so then it could be the way I talk the beater basically but I still think it's the cream just having a bit of a funny taste it's not really orientation is not really a pleasant taste well thankfully the rest of the flavors the Oreo biscuit and a white chocolate go for power we took quite a large extent but it's still there so I think for that reason run the fives gonna fall out 4.5 out of 5 really nice I think it really does something if you you pretty much get what you'd expect there's a slight distraction just detraction from that cream sensor but not as much as normal not as much as I've experienced in Ilario products mixed with chocolate bars in the past yeah normally it's been hardly any Oreo pieces in it's just all been that cream so then whether that's the case across the board now maybe I'll have to go back and revisit some of these over can be Oreo products but with this one at least at least in that bar and the amount of Aria pieces was fantastic and just want you these pets and they were very impressed with that as I say that cream still detracts from the overall taste but not as much as normal because it's just too many other pieces to allow it to do that so yeah and the white chocolate and very nice as well and I couldn't taste any let's say probably another can be whites instances I'm I've had the bitter we had chemically tasting them out but I couldn't say that at all in this case I don't house because of the earlier pieces again overpowering it but I don't think that's the case could still taste the white chocolate any was still nice so hmm you just have a nice white chocolate say bit sickly as I said we're not but again because of the other things in it cream included I guess all that could be a bit sickly and he didn't he didn't over he didn't catch him afloat as much as normal I managed to eat the whole bar just then and did have any problems so yeah yeah four point five words or five mm-hmm okay Iceland oh you think he'll I mean if he gave that to know what you think a be white products an Oreo is well in general and yeah in the

anything weird we're not doing healthy things like fruit just good old arrow chocolate a glass of milk I've been wanting to do just chocolate episode since I started this the whole point of AJ eats was was to eat things that I didn't really know about but that I would enjoy and then it kind of derailed until I put all these weird things in your mouth some of you want me to eat eyeballs and stuff like this is a show to enjoy ourselves not for you guys to enjoy my suffering alright anyways we've got some chocolate here so arrow as you all know I made by Nestle they are known for making the bubbly to the bubbly chocolate and as a kid I've always loved the bubbly chocolate and now they decided to make a whole bunch of flavors probably cuz nobody's buying the blood lis anymore because everybody's kind of fat now and everyone's trying to cut back on the chocolate this is how they hook you back in they make different flavors and you're like I remember arrow I got to try this just like they did with me and now I'm gonna eat five chocolate bars just because I'm like I got to try it it's science but really they're hooking me back in they're smart so today five flavours the original this is what we're gonna measure everything against and then we're gonna see if we can surpass the goodness bubbly flavor of arrow we've got what we got I can't even read these things I know it's beautiful for you guys but I need to read what's going on so we got a dark cherry truffle this looks like it's just bursting with a cherry there's no way I'm gonna get this back where it's supposed to be so kind of long ago that's actually very good then we've got a dark mint chocolate now spoilers I do love my milk chocolate but I've gotten older and crankier dark chocolate is where it's at I know it's more bitter and less sweet but it's kind of like my soul so we're good me and dark chocolate we get along together this high expectations for the dark chocolate and the mint then we got some white chocolate who really likes white chocolate it's only good with Kinder Surprise you got a little bit of brown with a little bit of white here so I suspect if you can hit Kinder Surprise goodness you're you're good in my books and then oh we just got a pure dark chocolate yeah so we got we got some strong contenders here and of course you got to pair your chocolate with some milk because I'm not just gonna scarf down some chocolate like a barbarian you gotta cleanse the palate after everyone but now first we got to set the tone that presentation you know it's always been like this I just forgot why I was like so we're gonna have one thing we're gonna do one little bubbly week I'm cute that is I love it you got the bubbles inside you've never had a narrow chocolate bar do yourself a favor go grab one I don't know what's so good about it's like the air the air is what taste good about these I've just painted the mouth with chocolate I know you gotta wash it a bit it's milk what am I doing with my life what am i doing I'm in chocolate I'm a good time yeah we're going with the white chocolate because I'm just trust me dammit just trust me we're doing the white choco first because our hopes for the white chocolate are high look at this massive amount of chocolate yeah I'm gonna be so fat by the end of hey J eats ever takes off my friends you guys are gonna make me obese it's not gonna be funny alright so you break it it does look like a Kinder Surprise I love the direction we're going in here all the bubblies are white I don't know how they did that how do you do that how do you do that how do you get such a perfect divided between the bubbly chocolate and the not bubbly chocolate huh I'm curious how they do it let's doing some good stuff in here mm-hmm the white chocolate has a bit more of a I feel like it's less creamy in your mouth it coats your mouth less which to me that's good the white chocolate has a bit more of a spike in sweetness I find so I would almost say the white chocolate arrow is more balanced when it comes to my opinion to the regular arrow chocolate I did not expect this the white chocolate arrow better than the original this one well I mean they're all gonna be love it so we all know this love it like it hater in math it's gonna be a love it the white chocolate right now better than the original now let's let's wash it down let's reset the palate it's just an excuse tea more cha glaze it doesn't actually do anything I'm just making up  as I go I gotta stop saying words like that kid-friendly shop that's again just a bitterness you know with the dark chocolate there's there's your dark arrow next to your milk chocolate arrow it's nothing new here it's exactly what you would expect the bubbles are dark the outside is dark it's bitter it's dark you'll get there too when you pass 30 years old it's all downhill can't imagine what's like after for you boom when that really is better this is really bitter 70% dark chocolate that's up there it's dark chocolate it's bitter it tastes exactly like what you'd expect but with a little bit of bubblies when it comes to the dark chocolate I like to pair that with wine personally I find the wine and the dark chocolate go together but with milk when you when you have milk stick to milk chocolate that's the roll okay when you're ranking dark chocolate against friggin regular chocolate of course it's gonna lose its gets a like it for me I know my wine wine it wine and dark chocolate is one reset I expect good things there we go again with the I don't know how they're doing this oh but um they're getting the bubbles one color and the outside another color it's they're magicians ooh that smells really minty you're getting really that mint this is like an after 8 I suspect very well together mint dark chocolate over regular dark chocolate hands down I don't feel like I can barely put dark chocolate against milk chocolate because they're completely two different categories one is intentionally bitter and the other one is intentionally sweet but if you have to have a dark chocolate arrow bar go with the mint mmm it is so so good all right now this guy's a little weird because he's a smaller package but he's you know what they say good things come in small packages or something I say well I call on that but whatever looks the same as everything else I don't know where the truffle part comes in I can already smell the cherry bursting out of this very very fragrant Wow that's really strong now this looks the same as all the others you got you got the slightly red bubbles and then you got the magic coating of I don't I really don't know how they do this now it looks like by the picture the the top of the bubble here it's gonna have like some some gooeyness to it okay mm-hmm this is a dark cherry party going on right here so these came out of the fridge mind you oh there's a lot of cherries so in the top they added some flavor that you don't see in all the other ones the other ones are just straight-up chocolate this one here they added stuff and I don't know if this was room temperature if it would just like goo out everywhere but there is definitely another little pocket of flavor there and then the whole chocolate is cherry I suspect hmm Wow have you loved Carrie if you like cherry you're gonna love this it's exactly as you with me now honestly that I think any onion of this chocolate would be bad no I just want to excuse to eat a tall dark cherry I wouldn't buy it just because I don't like dark cherry I would buy for a dark cherry lover this gets a matte from me but if you're just looking for the the Kinder Surprise experience the white chocolate is probably the best value for your money that's a guilty pleasure the the mint I feel that's a that's a nice like dessert it's a treat yourself dessert kind of thing we got we got another Levitt here you know it's been a long day at work people have been making you angry and upset everybody it's raining you know you got yourself wet it's just been a rough day you get home you just sit back you relax pop back dark chocolate mint Aero thought that's when you want to eat this now the dark chocolate dark chocolate you want to have this after you just don't give a anymore life is rough you've given up you're stuck with what you got you're gonna make it work you're gonna pour yourself a glass of wine you're gonna buy yourself the dark chocolate arrow and you're just gonna tell everyone leave me alone I'm binge watching my stuff and playing my games getting it my dark chocolate and then finally we've got the arrow this is if you want to live and taste innocence you want to go back to the good old days when you had nothing to worry about other than who's gonna give you your next dosage of chocolate the Aero classic tried and true if you don't don't don't don't don't change what isn't broken I am bastardizing

health benefits that are associated with chocolates and can be good for the consumers this is particularly true if people choose and consume chocolates wisely the surprising news pertains to the fact that a chocolate can contain over 300 chemicals which have become the subject that scientific organizations and universities have focused and led to the good news so these are what they found

this this is what they came to be the fourth type of chocolate it is actually released in a shredder just last week and we've been hearing a little bit about it seeing a bit Instagram stories here and there I've been dying to try it I have no idea what it tastes like it's pink kind of looks like it'll taste like white chocolate and a bit of strawberry that's what it looks like but finally it's made of cacao song so the composition is more like a milk chocolate so yeah kind of curious to see if it tastes more like why I don't milk I have no idea no idea it's kind of weird like we're gonna eat pink chocolate and it's not gonna have any coloring in it no fruits no added extra thing it's actually just chocolate I'm expecting to be mind blown because it's pink I don't want to hype it up too much but really excited to try what it tastes like alright so we'll open it up and we'll see what it smells like burst mm whoa hey I think I can smell the fruitiness of that very cool it's actually more like pinkish perfectly than I thought it would look it's got a like a darker pink to it it doesn't look as shiny as I thought it would look yeah it's got like quite a movie-like kind of dusty pink kind of time very very trendy mm-hmm color I love this color all right let's see how this tastes whoa wow I'm really surprised it is so punchy yeah that is very different to what I thought actually I was expecting at the tastes more like milk chocolate because of the the cocoa solids 47.3% but um no it doesn't taste like milk chocolate isn't no like a rich cocoa flavor that I associate with milk or Tom very interesting this is this is a game changer Rudy really fruity because all these ideas run by like Oh could I use this one yes not not sickeningly sweet can use it to balance out something a bit more decadent Wow yeah I can't believe this like to know we're doing this at all like this is literally just cooker beans sugar milk solids and like maybe something like it also fire or something this has they're like flavorings that's wrong yeah it's actually quite hard to believe if you didn't know this was just chocolate it's just so incredibly fruity yeah yeah it's tasty it's tasty it's got a good sound s to it yeah I think it'd be nice for people who like don't want something to speed I mean it's not bitter at all yeah but it has that nice bit of freshness to it so mmm very different very interesting experience alright so you got some milk chocolate and some white chocolate here just to be able to tell the difference with you are yeah this will help us keep us grounded okay well it's really different now that I space I thought it was like white chocolate but no white chocolate is very sweet variously much more prominently sweet no fruity on the turns it's just like a really buttery sweet flavor Ruby yeah that sound is definitely correct it's a lie now that's the cocoa flavor that that's yeah Familia yeah the composition of this is actually a quite similar to know from what I've read but they taste completely different I was skeptical of Ruby chocolate being like a whole new discovery with a new chocolate because I thought okay maybe they preserve the pink color of cocoa beans somehow and they've developed a pink colored milk chocolate variant but it is a whole different chocolate definitely the cocoa bean derived flavor is a whole different flavor yeah I'm satisfied and I was surprised because it's a whole new chocolate smells different tastes different textures different mmm did not disappoint at all after all the hype from the past few months seen Ruby pop up here and there I'm so glad that we held off and we resisted to try the real thing so hopefully after this we'll be coming out with a few different recipes and we're gonna try Ruby in a few different ways yeah I can't wait to see what sort of flavor combination alright so that was Ruby chocolate thanks for watching how do you tried Ruby before if you have did you agree with us what did it taste like or if you haven't do you want to try it and what do you think it would taste like if you're somewhere where you can get your hands on some Ruby chocolate we highly recommend it go ahead and try it for yourself it's definitely a new type of chocolate but is it be full type of chocolate we'll talk about that in another video [Applause] all right so let's

your heart and your brain you must be wondering why am i talking about chocolates so guys today's topic is a chocolate now i had some questions with me what is the chocolate health benefits of chocolates history of chocolates and many more things to know about this video so watch till the end so the first question that arrives is what is chocolate okay chocolate is prepared from the fruit of the theobroma cacao a tropical tree whose name means food of the gods in greek according to chocolate food of the gods yes an online exhibit by the colonel university library theobroma cacao trees are native to the amazon and oronoco river basins in south america the trees are widely distributed from southeastern mexico to the amazon river they thrive in hot humid areas about 20 degrees of the equator according to cornell as the popularity of chocolate spread growers established plantations in other regions such as west africa and south and southeast asia now the second question that arrives is what are the types of chocolate okay fine chocolate falls into three categories dark chocolate milk chocolate and white chocolate first is dark chocolate dark chocolate has chocolate liquor cocoa butter sugar and vanilla second is milk chocolate milk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids third is white chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor now the third question that arrives is health risks of eating chocolate okay like many foods chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation the sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories which may lead to weight gain furthermore many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might to be mitigated by over consumption now last but not the least history of chocolate scientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming coca beans chocolate's history goes back at least two thousand years the word chocolate can be traced back to the aztec word theokotal the name of a bitter drink made from cocoa beans this was the way chocolate was consumed until the spanish conquistadors came to central america in several pre-columbian latin american societies coca beans were used as currency yes mayans and aesthetics believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals chocolate was a fashionable drink for rich europeans throughout the 18th century the industrial revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the tree to the masses the popularity led to the development of coca-tree plantations so could you get some information about the chocolates by this video i hope you will it was a really informative video about the chocolates and the history of chocolates and i told you about many things in this video that how many types of chocolates are there what are the history of chocolates how it came to existence what it is made of what is the chocolate and everything if i

scarlet i dropped it right on the dog okay colombia has the most blank of any country on earth bird species coffee farms soccer stadiums or poisonous snakes colombia is known for their coffee but it could be bird species because of the rainforest but we don't we don't know half of the animal species there so i'm gonna say i'm gonna say bird speed no i'm gonna say coffee farms no it's birds oh see i knew it was one of those two all right let me get back to reading about these they look like like little like things you would get on like easter time for a fiesta in colombia a girl's 15th birthday is celebrated with a fiesta de quince amas anos or quincianera quincy the fun starts with a father-daughter waltz and ends you want to dance no and ends with a horologa crazy hour when guests wear wacky masks and blow whistles in between you eat plenty of snacks like these kooky white chocolate candy coated gummies are you allowed to have gummies with your braces yeah colored to match the birthday girls traditional pastel dress let's just say that if fun had a taste we think this would be it which what color you're trying to bring oh i like that what is that oh what was that it's dog whistle try to keep them quiet oh did you anyone was waiting no hmm the white chocolate definitely makes that's good kind of tastes like a jelly bean on the inside except like not hard and if they don't like it yeah not i was expecting the gummy to be more chewy which one do you know i guess i guess i get the purple how would you like to rate these i'm thinking they're i'm thinking they are five five oh yeah what do you think four and a half four four yeah these are so unique we've never had these before ever and they're very tasty four all right compromise four and a half five all right oh we had number 11 first that's your favorite number everything seems to be 11 this year my age my bus number like a lot of things are 11. that's two things well there's other things that just like randomly come up that i can't remember okay are you gonna eat that one are you gonna eat the blue one okay and from here we're gonna move on to the yeah those are good i can't believe you didn't give it a 5. the keiko plant has been cultivated in colombia for five thousand years so locals have had lots of time to perfect their chocolate in fact a whopping 95 percent of colombian chocolate is considered fine by the international cocoa organization versus ordinary keep that in mind if you feel the urge to compare this colombian fave to a three musketeers sure they're both filled with extra fluffy nougat but we think you'll find there's a very fine and very chocolatey line between the two hmm yep definitely more chocolatey than sweet musketeers tastes like coffee at the end does not i don't taste any coffee at all it does nougat chocolaty coating doesn't say anything about coffee beans or anything like that i think that's your imagination here's the cockpit but well as fine as it may be three musketeers better kind of just taste like chocolate ice cream but as a candy bar yeah i agree with that assessment how would you like to rate these i wasn't about two and a half it wasn't bad but it wasn't really like unique or anything i was gonna say three but three is fine all right so we've got lemon plantain chips lemon bacon chips mayonnaise potato chips come on when we had the

here and I want to talk about the standard chocolate Hershey's not because it's the best chocolate I'm not going to claim that but because it's the most recognizable shop in America the best-selling and it really is just good solid chocolate at a good price and so you know you're gonna get something good when you buy a Hershey's now I usually buy Hershey's in the king-size when I go to the 7-eleven I go to a king-size they have obviously they all usually always have the thin one which is the exact same thing and then my wife buys me these delicious Hershey's nuggets and these I loved by everyone everybody loves them these are perfect this is really the perfect package because you can feed your addiction without feeling like a like a cook laughs like like someone who has to have it all the time you have a couple of these it's tough to have just one and and the great thing about this is really just the way it fits as a candy and the chocolate into your mouth so you have this really beautiful it's beautiful a little rounded chocolate so it's got a different shape than the usual chocolates but it's pure chocolate there's no filling which is nice I don't want to fill it then you have the thin one and if thin one is good but as you can see it breaks up all the time it's always breaking up on you it's never gonna be good like handle when you get the king-size when you get the king-size you know you're gonna get each mouthful is to be substantial you see it didn't break it's solid it's a good thing so this is why when I go to the store I'll buy this I'll better the king-size and of course I'll eat the whole thing and then this one is the best because really you can like moderate your eating and not feel like you're good you can eat just entire bar chocolate thing you know so these are my three go twos and the King sizes is the one I buy when I'm on the road if there are teeth it doesn't taste any different I don't think so it does probably my hand as taste is in your head anyway what I like about the king size I'm gonna have some now listen um say this this is chocolate I'm saying yeah it's just it's just a right-field it breaks oh gee ya hear no sound is nothing nothing this is real and the little guy doesn't snap a lot well if that's not true um good man good chocolate man new clothes on that's great I live in Rhode Island you give me her shoes I can whip this is fine this will do it now this does break up as well even though it's small there's another part of the addiction of chocolate which is ice cream related and when all the Belgian chocolate ice cream is gone you have vanilla which is good but you want your chocolate and so there's two things you can do you can get Nutella which is awesome or you can get these and these do break see they did hear sound and what's funny is they break they're really small you can really break him up which I can't break it up right now it's just funny I can't break it up which is funny I'm gonna eat it these things go very well with the new ice cream and yeah you really do I can't crumbly right now come at night hands are so sticky with chopping you can break this up into about four or five pieces and spray on your ice cream is pretty good you can see it's about the same thickness as the extra thick but that's not why that you know this is just a mouthful but this is you know this is a car ride the king size is a car ride you know you get yourself moving some water or I don't like to drink something drink with chocolate I don't like to mix the two but by the time I get out of basketball and I Drive home it's gone and it's a car ride chocolate bar so my last review on Scharffen Berger was harsh and I realized that and I'm thinking maybe the problem was that I had to Hershey's before I had 200 shopping burger maybe the two tastes are just not meant to mingle now I've looked online and i'ma try and clans palate with the with the wine cheap wine and really get get my mouth ready for a different kind of chocolatey time I may not stick with the Hershey pre eating it might be a mistake in terms of truly an understanding and an issue of the taste of a different kind of bar it's a net drop no I don't drink wine I drink Southern Comfort this is a little bit bitter and it tastes like wine so I don't think that's a good idea either maybe Brent Leigh I'll try bread or just water just", "irUuc-gQIvQ": "Woolsey kids are awesome hey what are we making today apples yeah so we've got that bull is getting washed in hot water yeah and I try to get the wax off for me I'm playing lovely Sam and they have my measuring condo the kids are getting ready for school Ellie's not ready yet I do have two so the wax melts off of them and they get clean because people have to eat these so you don't want guns on them yeah that's the first part of food so then ignore my ugly crock-pot it's and you have to all these thermals so they can melt in this it's gonna be a saddle caramel apple yeah they're the granny smith apples are kind of sour huh yeah that's what makes it so good cuz yeah the sour mixed with the tart so we're gonna get this process going when kids get home from school they'll be ready to dip and check out all these they're not going anywhere are they having for like a month now on them yeah I hit some baby ones you did hmm all right okay so easy process it just is time-consuming so if you want to make your own caramel apples do it if you want to make these cuddle apples I have to do is so Journal dot-com and you know how to get these and green and how to make them yeah we'll have a tutorial on how to make them honnestly and make them at home with their family yeah yeah yeah cuz they're super super good do you think your favorite it's gonna be Oreo or Heath or Butterfinger or coconut or cinnamon sugar cuz I'm going to do some time insurance yeah they're so good all of them are my favorite those you don't like caramel no you will want is gonna eat the oil okay okay sounds good okay so once you have all your caramels in your crock pot you're gonna flip it to low you don't want to burn out of them and let those start to melt and then in a little bit we're going to add some heavy whipping cream so that it's not too thick okay so after you've washed your apples and they're all nice and clean and you've dried them off and you've got your caramel melting you're gonna get your little shish kebabs and you're gonna put them through the middle so that you have something to dip your Apple in okay these are kind of big popsicle sticks were thinner but I could not find any at the store so thank you so it's gonna be these fish kebab sticks instead but that's okay because now you have a Dipper and they look you you can like tie a bow on them and stuff em so the next step is done so I'm just enjoying this this moment I have a question for you what before you cook what is the most important thing you do don't touch your mouth and involve germs what's the most important step before you cook anything stand it No wash your hands there you go wash your hands and we're gonna put this you were away because they put his mouth on it you always with soap okay with like at least 30 seconds because what does that mean what what does watching your done to those rooms okay so now that you've washed your hands and you've got McLean skewered now I go ahead and put one in an apple try not to break it just gotta push it in the middle like inside the stem mm-hmm there you go careful don't break it they're heavy apples and Gilbert good job okay don't break it yeah it's gonna break well the popsicle sticks are but I can't find nothing we'll dip them soon okay so we got all of our apples skewered they're all ready to be dipped nice and clean and then I just added some heavy whipping cream to the caramel so as it melts it will thin it out and then all I do a stir test and if it's thin enough I don't add more but if it's still really thick I keep adding anything to it so looking cream look at the magic happening are you excited yeah what kind are you gonna taste Oreo cinnamon sugar he wanna buy their fingers coconut so Oreo is probably the most popular and the cinnamon sugar tastes like apple pie it's delicious I have to get it out and mix it you have cheese on my school starts in like 20 minutes all right let's check it out see how we're coming along here it's melting wonderfully it smells delicious like melted caramel I think we're not too far away from being able to dip see how it kind of sends out the caramel if you add some heavy whipping cream if you do it too thick you'll just have like gobs of caramel on your Apple but if you thin it out it just gives it a nice layer if you do it too thin then your caramel is just gonna run off your apples so you got to kind of play with it get an idea of how thick you want it sometimes it's hit or miss I haven't done this for a really long time so hopefully it turns out good okay so we're gonna go ahead and try to dip an apple and see how it goes so you just kind of dip it in there coat it still might be a little bit thick see how it looks you kind of spin it around get some about extra caramel off I really wish I had popsicle sticks coz these bamboo stick things are not strong at all okay I have a sprayed cookie sheet if you don't have spray you can use some wax paper he's gonna go so light in everywhere after you have them dipped you're gonna put them in the fridge to kind of harden off wow it is really sliding over like I don't know why it's so slippery cuz it shouldn't be it should be level hopefully I bought enough caramel to do 18 half bowls cuz you seem kinda thick you know bigger than I planned [Music] so anyway you get the idea okay I'm gonna finish these okay so I got the first batch done and now I'm gonna put them in the fridge yeah you guys did you notice that a mom is gonna come up me to preschool today yeah we got to go to a preschool they're here yeah we gotta get these guys done enough just use that cuz we're gonna do I I have to move with these guys out of the way first sweet okay so I got a whole bunch of extra caramel so these ones are gonna be like really caramel e I just kind of poured spoonfuls over the top of them hey you know what they're gonna be covered by chocolate and candy so you won't really see it alright we put these babies in the fridge yeah so that we can make some good snacks I'm so good yes and I can't wait to eat but I knew okay so the next steps is that you're gonna have to get your toppings ready so you get yeah your client phonetic sound over there okay so we're gonna mix coconut and nuts together these are gonna be another Butterfinger Oreo and then I'm gonna get equal parts in a miniature burger laughs oh man dropping your stuff let's get up for you here you Hey so that's your cup yeah the best way to do this is to get like a hammer and just how's that until they're tiny if you have a food processor very grinded up in that I don't I have a hammer and that's how I roll yeah they're they're drying right now they're getting cold so we can melt the chocolate and do those things you will all right okay it's gonna be our official masher we've got over here we've got our coconut pecan max this is the cinnamon sugar we're smashing up the butterfingers right now okay we've got our toppings we've got Butterfinger Oreo cinnamon sugar coconut and if not we'll have to I just took the smash pieces the next step is gonna be to melt our chocolate yeah we've got white chocolate and milk chocolate and then once the kids are home you will do that part and baby is pause the slave wing stuff well you add a little bit of Crisco to be so that they don't trap because if you don't rocky yeah yeah we made um huh and you helped me yes don't touch are you doing let's get me to dance ha I really need a clean dirty no someday I'll do my chores okay pardon you can see there's a lot of extra caramel and then you kind of mold it I just uh I promise my hands are nice and clean so whoever is eating this isn't afraid of my germs okay so we're gonna first make milk chocolate with peanut butter finger that will there butterfingers quote your normal Apple in the chocolate nice and good and then you're gonna coat it in the Butterfinger nice and thick this is one of the reasons why you have to buy so much stuff yeah thumbs up like this and then you're just gonna same thing put it back and let it harden up okay that process with a few different kinds of flavors and we'll show you the end palette all right can't wait to see it okay so I mentioned before that when you are doing this you want to add just a little food full of some Crisco this will help your chocolate from cracking I've done it before it just picks the chocolate a little bit more smooth and it won't once it's cold it won't crack so we just you know mix it in there entreaties like I was hot [Music] right now we are going to dip snap chocolates big okay so I so this is what they look like when they're all done I kind of just drizzled some chocolate over the top to make them pretty and then I'm gonna put them back in the fridge harden up because right now they're kind of melting Madeline's temperatures so they're delicious too bad we have to give them away to everybody huh well there's one of each crying for us to eat so we'll do a video of us tasting them but everything else is going to adapt employees and some other people kind of fun it's a tedious process but they turn out awesome and I mean they're like they're massive those are huge so it's gonna probably take them every time to eat you have to cut them up and eat them there's they're they're kind of hard to eat okay awesome okay so here's our finished product my stick broke on this one so don't mind that but we've got coconut nut butter finger cinnamon and sugar Oreo I like the white chocolate better than the milk chocolate with these just because it's the Apple is very kind of tart and the white chocolate just it's a good pairing so ours are a white chocolate but which one are you excited to try oh yeah Oreo yeah that tastes like apple pie it's really good so we're gonna cut these up and do a taste test okay hey what are we doing they're really good okay so we're gonna have a taste test of the apples [Music] yeah oh my favorite we got really picky kids like really picky like we're lucky if they get to eat butter on their noodles mm-hmm let's see here dad wants to try one I want to try the coconut I haven't ever tried oh yeah it's pretty good tastes like does it so what flavors did we do do we do a Butterfinger yep nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger [Music] all right come tell me the winner that sounds like the clear winner I say Butterfinger but it's a close tie between Butterfinger and cinnamon sugar [Music] for me at the close time I've said the cinnamon sugar apparently is the clear winner but for me it was a close one between the two comment below if you'd like us to ship you a piece of Apple I don't know okay so I think it was pretty successful fun definitely worth doing again thanks for watching and man those apples are good", "ZnzzhYdNg9k": "[Music] hello I got some very very important information to tell you listen up have you ever had one of

means it's time for yet another edition of sip and snack and before we get started I do want to wish everyone and that celebrates happy thanksgiving and for those of you that do not celebrate thanksgiving well happy thursday we're going to be focusing on one brand and a myriad of different things from that brand we're gonna be talking about limited edition Pringles and pringles has always been something that I've enjoyed throughout the years and also has a really awesome bit from one of my favorite comedians that died way too soon and that's Mitch Hedberg basically saying that I think Pringles original intention was to make tennis balls but on the day the rubber was supposed to show up a truckload of potatoes arrived Pringles is a laid-back company so they just said let's just cut them up so paraphrasing is obviously am I gonna curse on the channel but yeah rest in peace Mitch Hedberg now Pringles is obviously the once you pop you can't stop you know the gimmick basically it is this tennis ball cannon it's basically what it is and they are like potato chips and there's different flavors we're going to be focusing on the limited edition varieties this time around got my animated character taster blast like we always do and we've got three different kinds of Pringles now Pringles I'll give you a little bit of backstory as I look upward because you know you love that first sold in 1967 and they've been distributed since 1975 they were introduced overseas in 1991 now basically they were originally called Pringles newfangled potato crisps I almost want to do this whenever I do this and feel like a miner or something but the snick snack manufacturers objected they said that Pringles failed to meet the definition of a potato chip so the food and drug administration basically said in 1975 Pringles can only use the word chip with this phrase potato chips made from dried potatoes and of course we all know the United Kingdom chips are called crisps and that's another story altogether now Pringles is manufactured in Jackson Tennessee and belgium malaysia and china which is very random those throughout the entire world so yes this is Kellogg Company right again so we've done a lot of Kellogg products lately so we do another one so we're gonna be focusing on limited edition varieties of Pringles and obviously we're talking about limited edition we're talking about flavors you're not going to see very often on your shelves unless they succeed and that are three of what I would like to call dessert Pringles that's not their official title obviously that's just what I'm calling them we have milk chocolate look at that Pringles guy he wishes that he had a mustache like my good friend Tim white chocolate and last but not least something I've become very accustomed to lately salted caramel so we're gonna start out with white chocolates I'll shoot with you guys probably the one I'm gonna like the least so we're gonna open this up it says you don't just eat them so let's see what we got here pop sucker off here and the second I do it smells like white chocolate it really does these probably would be like good for Christmas like when you're having like Christmas filled thanksgiving meals or any sort of holiday meals where you have like a snack tray these are probably really good chips for that because you don't necessarily have to have like chocolate candy or chocolate cookies or white chocolate cookies or white chocolate candy or salted caramel anything no you actually just have the chips so kill two birds one stem it looks just like a regular Pringles does not smell like a regular Pringles let's see what we got here this is the white chocolate variant here so let's try now that signature Pringles kick combined with white chocolate is you're pretty good oh yeah kind of understand white chocolate to me it kind of tastes like powdered sugar I know it's not but that's what kind of tastes like so let's just try one more just to be safe hmm oh yeah teluk powdered sugar like you would get on a funnel cake that's pretty much what it is it's like that white chocolate flavored powdered sugar on top of Pringles there's a regular Pringles like an original pringles that's pretty good so where to go from one extreme to the next and that is milk chocolate so so we got here from milk chocolate looks a little bit different kind of someone I like chocolate McCoy so you notice it looks like it has a little cocoa on the bottom of it so Coco flavored regular original pringles is what I'm guessing these are going to taste like let's see if I'm right oh yeah these are chocolate Pringles and they're really good um again the original pringles flavor is the kick at the very end and right away you are greeted with this awesome cocoa flavor the hit your palate immediately so yeah I definitely recommend these if you don't like chocolate obviously probably not but these are pretty good these are like I said dessert Pringles really good if you want to get like your chip and your candy in the same package I think that would work really well that way you don't have to like make cookies you can just have like a couple of these canisters out there obviously on like a nice decorative trailer probably like a snowman or a Christmas tree or something like that or any other variate that you want to have but yeah I kind like your snack trying to be perfect for this and these are really good so yeah again what I'm imagining the white chocolate was basically funnel cake powder as white chocolate the milk chocolate is cocoa powder on top of the original pringles we got one more left and that's the one that's jump out at me salted caramel I'm positive this is going to smell intense see what we got here put these back on oh yeah we're about to find out what they smell like um they look a little more yellow obviously the last two were like a regular collar these are a little bit more yellow in the consistency the caramel color is probably I'm guessing a muckle I they smell like caramel so let's see what they taste like they're gonna be even more salty as a chip and salted caramel on a potato chip should be really interesting potato crisp whatever you want to call it even though you're in the UK I'm just basically calling potato crisps these are not crisps I mean I guess they are but I'm if I said potato chips you'd be like no these are potato chips but here they are so see what we got Oh ma'am now that signature taste of the Pringles the original pringles these are all original pringles before they get there like extra flavoring obviously like the white chocolate powder and the cocoa powder in this case it's more of the caramel with the salt taste then the chip taste I know it's strange but it's true so got one more here a little different so there we go we did like a regular chip it's going to be fun and it tastes a little bit more like the original pringles that we're used to yeah so yeah if you can find the limited edition flavors or I like to call the desert Pringles of the white chocolate and milk chocolate and the salted caramel get them they're really good like I said you can have your salt and sweet I know this probably fits the salty and sweet we did last month but still this is something that I think would be a welcome addition to your snack trays around the holiday season regardless what holiday you celebrate or if you don't celebrate anything at all you like some sort of sporting event or something there or something more important like that with the Oscars obviously coming up in a couple of months and then WrestleMania come up after that or if you just want to chill out and just sit in the chairs at your Barcalounger with this big tube of chips in your lap and just go to town they're all worth it and they definitely taste good so they're exactly what you think they would be they taste great and especially if you'd like that original pringles taste right up your alley so that ends another edition of sipping stack next week I'm not going to tell you guys what we're gonna do we're actually going to have some

guys and girls out there for watching and then until tomorrow boys and girls that's all I got to say about that", "Wf9xQCvxv_E": "what's up guys for today's video I'm gonna show you really cool trick with chocolate ok let's start so to make this trick work correctly you want to have chocolate like this with four pieces here and then six pieces over here I'm gonna start by counting two pieces over here and I will mark them with the toothpick and then three pieces over here and let's mark it with this toothpick like that and what we want to do is two cup chocolate like this this way from here to there so I'm going to use ruler to mark it so it looks like this I'm going to cut from here to here and this is actually the hardest part to cut it correctly and not break any pieces then we wanna do is cut chocolate all the way here so we don't need this piece for now there you go we don't need this piece for now all is left is to cut this way here okay let's connect all the pieces back like this and we will count 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 now watch closely guys I'm gonna rearrange them like this this one goes here and that one goes over here look at that so we have an extra piece of chocolate let's count 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 that is crazy you guys let me know in the comments what's going on here why is it happening why I haven't your piece of chocolate here big thumbs up for this trick and I hope you liked this video don't forget to subscribe leave a like and I'll see you next time [Music]", "S50a1gdYzZc": "what's up guys welcome back to another hi Ravi you didn't wanna be trying 12 different trumpets that's well moderately different price one which one is most worth it worth it that isn't weight anyways let's get straight to the review hello welcome to the chocolate review team oh I have set up here so we have 11 different varieties milk chocolate that we were going to try and along with that we have some of these varieties refrigerated so we can keep things cool anyways I traveled across every grocery store within the known universe I walked through mini candy aisles some were more and some not Walmart well most of them were not Walmart because this Walmart there's only one store [Music] anyways I'm making the point I travel far and wide to become the greatest rib you or like no one ever wants wait this isn't chocolate let's get straight to their view so the first chocolate we have is Hershey's of course classic coming in at $1.28 so yeah I mean I don't know how I feel about this is the classic it's Hershey's dude I mean where could he go wrong so I'm just gonna open this up mmm and look at that look the row is so so it goes this snap this song and yeah I mean Hershey's and what more what else what more could it be classic it's pretty sweet yes to try loafer great version of this walking her harder so this is good they're gonna change months I was irate 2010 since this isn't me since this is in the beginning I'm just gonna read it I bought out 10 this is for the start so next we have tagged a $1.04 it is described as velvety velvet velvet velvet velvet velvet Lee smooth velvety melody no woody smooth velvety smooth and has a dairy milk in it so that's when you know what's good believe it so I like how the packaging here says lift and pull here hold here really intuitive I would have never guessed that so it's gonna yeah we're gonna see if this is velvety smooth as I said oh it's in rows of four all right three ha ha ha it's in the road it's in rows of three well it's like the corner here I'm not a little I mean that's gonna be a problem there yeah um it's a bit lighter in color than the Hershey's I hope that means it's a bit more milky and less sugar I do not say this is pretty you velvety smooth as it says it's really nice section and we try go for a great version and snap there something some more anyways yeah well then since I have to shoot through the chocolate and you know that breaking the Breton's and Sharjah then melting I taste more of a milkiness with this one compare the Hershey's I would definitely pay 3 more sense for this so I'll just put the Hershey's at four out of ten and I'll put this at five out of ten Cadbury gets a 500 Chatman from me anyways next my one thing the same as if a fairy is Dove chocolate now personally I think this is gonna be pretty good unlike the recipes chocolate this one has bird in it so we're gonna open this one up yeah look at that so mutts not the Cadbury it's in rows of the reasons for its in rows at the ring oh that's my hair anyways it's in rows of three and it's a lot browner in presentation and the rest of the chocolate the rest of these have been pretty square pretty block head in this one it's pretty smooth it's those and sad bird feathers coming back out anyways that's really good these are some scam lighting color now the cat berries are so smoothly like melts in your mouth it has a bit of a nutty flavor earthy flavor it's a bit saltier than the rest you know I say this one's pretty good I'll give it a seven point five out of ten and here's a refrigerator version it tastes more the saltiness in this chocolate earned their fish yeah that's pretty good so next time one dollar and seventy four cents we have blended chocolate so packaging alone this is the first one that comes in a box I got a tear apart so yeah yeah let's go to do things violently here [Music] all right I didn't cut it Hey and motor so so I still failed to cut it so you know we're just gonna gonna man so unlike the others it's that it's in rows of five yeah it's a pretty saw block it says Linden on these break one off hmm I think really tastes of milk in this one something something about this hits me I think yeah some no this one's pretty milky coming in with a cover like that there's more milk than there is an actual chocolate so I'll say if you like something really Nucky go for this compared to the others really you know this is the mill kiyose in flavor but it's it's it's pretty dark compared to her shoes so here's the refrigerator version still milking man compared to the recipes I'm gonna give this a six out of ten if you're looking for something very milky in the market in your chocolate and yeah I'll pick this so next up you have Toblerone Toblerone and one dollars and eighty-eight cents now funny story um a friend gift to me this after a certain anime came out hey this is Casca I'll bring her a big tour d'azyr Robert ate all the wrong that's really thoughtful anyways yeah I mean I actually expected this to be a bit more expensive than the rest but no it's only out 188 this is pretty fairly price so so off the bat unlike the rest of the chocolates that are dumb and square this one is triangle I don't know what that means in intelligence sense but yeah we also failed mention and has honey and almond nougat and did I hit it alright okay well I should have done that crap okay where is so off the bat you notice that there's actual letters on these that spell out Toblerone I'm gonna try and avoid greatness on its honey and nougat contact one another by the nougat context I am big fan of the almond Yugi it is a nice crunch block really on the chocolate it's pretty good on its own - its chocolate and now we others were drinking on the frigerators version this more than the room it's a lot more crunch here I'm going pair Li off the milk chocolate flavor on stage is pretty good man don't give it us this attitude man you so much chocolate I'm all right you're right I mean you are eating chocolate that that you are correct I was gonna make a joke about type 2 diabetes but I see guy ruin it next up and 190 the last $1 + chocolate we have Sam's choice I don't know who Sam is exactly but he does surely like to label the covers of his chocolate premium Swiss chocolate I love House says enlarged - so show texture I really like that and it's carbon neutral so off the bat was gonna whoops open huh there's some text inside of this let's see did you know the sight smell sound and finally taste all experience differently with each of our Sam's choice chocolate bars I didn't know chocolates made sounds hopefully this one screams violently and painfully while I eat it this Sam's toys smoked chocolate bar delivers a silky smooth chocolate taste when you taste this bar you will experience the subtle notes of nut and vanilla rounded off by a touch of caramel so this is a milk chocolate that has everything oh they have more behind the bar that's my slam poetry for the night anyways oh oh man don't pretend that wasn't satisfying or that it did cut this open open your chocolate bar oh man so off the bat the design these have the least rows out of any bars which means when you take a bite on this you're getting the mousse chocolate most chocolat for a block CPB chocolate per box am nat one open flow whoa it wasn't like a median status icon one where I explained the snap you can snap this chocolate yourself you know lets us eat this no hmm maybe Sam's on to something this chocolate is pretty good it was nice is silky smooth hmm all right let's try refrigerator stove nice and gooey like the rest of the chocolate it's pretty good I'll give it a seven out of ten all right so next we have the girdle these chocolate come in here that Halloween sense now before you take away out of comment section saying Kevin this isn't caramel this Kevin this is a milk chocolate this has caramel in it while you see I go to the store and I originally bought this the latest dark chocolate they had by then a friend told me he said pride that's only with milk chocolate even if it has 'selenic so he can eat around the edges of this so so sorry this is the only one that I got so yeah I'm just gonna eat around the caramel one judge ago off of that so unlike the rest you got a lift you gotta lift it up like a box to open this so okay and it comes out whoo in this nice gold looking color see ya let's rip this open get the knife out here get a queen-high Oh chocolate off the bat once again this light the Sam's choice these chocolates come in two rows so yeah so I'm like the rest these are pretty elevated so I suspect that's because it's caramel I think of this if this was a regular milk chocolate version they have um it would be pretty flat so yeah let's snap this open and I'm gonna try and avoid the caramel so I'm just gonna eat around it wow that's actually pretty good I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this following anyways starter for dreamers you broke off a chunky yeah yeah chocolate is pretty good yeah I'm sorry that's pretty good oh if we're going off of the milk chocolate alone out of all these this gets to eight out of ten is this really solid milk chocolate mmm it doesn't rely on you know being nutty or or any other weird gimmick they're just good standard milk chocolate you know put that aside man this is starting to look like a garbage heap oh man look at all this let's just sweep that aside for a moment now next we have lint Lindor now I don't know what the difference is between lint land or and lint but my friend point out that these are milk chocolate truffle pieces now I don't know what that exactly means but I mean I guess means it's more expensive so let's try it oh yeah this comes at 279 oh yeah I like the recipes you've gotta just quit your finger in the middle and then whip it off and and yeah so the rest of the use I think this is the smallest in like width and height in area for your strength I'm gonna fold this over oh man all this intricate forwarding it's gonna be the death of me oh so there's a box within a box well this is grease we've been fancy and look at this this isn't even a bar it's a bunch of pieces together like you can see the spaces between them all right well I mean these come in pieces so yeah let's try one yeah psycho mantis oh so sick there's chocolate goo in the middle of these like look hmm the goo is pretty good actually well it's probably on that appetite you call a chocolate do but yeah feel like melts and spreads in your mouth so you someone made a Guster's bite entirely out of chocolate God saying go on milk chocolate takes along like the hard part it's pretty salty compared to the rest um I don't know how to rate this in milk chocolate bars standard synthesis isn't even really a bar but awful flavour alone oh let's try them for a version there yeah so do not freeze these violent but it in chocolate blue goo has turned into chocolate ice move chocolate taste this one's okay I mean if you're a fan help the choc do in the middle I will get this far along the terms of all the others this one's pretty average and chocolate milk taste so I'm gonna give that a 5 out of 10 so next we have good Davina Davina good diva so this is a last one with this nice golden baby panda game and yeah so these aren't so this isn't actually a chocolate bar it's Oh milk chocolate with creamy milk chocolate filling much like the Lindor so I'm gonna compare it to that let's see which one wins a creamy chocolate in the middle battle yeah just got out rip it through there and you got our Arista down yeah yeah so off the bat this is the most golden one of the wrappers it's pretty golden I don't know any of the night because it means trip it up here alright so yeah so opening up here um it kind of looks like some chocolate Legos I'm not line these kind of look like pills I'm not gonna lie just some random youth very symmetrical and round Devils but yeah let's break it off and see the chocolate filling in the middle hmm let me try the frigerator oh hey Liz come here you'll endure this chocolate beets Lindor in milk chocolate flavor and this tea nice gooeyness on the inside is this a much more pleasant texture it's like the texture you get from toothpaste I know people don't eat toothpaste that sounds an appetizer but that's the best I can describe the texture this one this feels a lot more liquidy like a gusher so I'm just out of the chocolate scale I did this a 7 out of 10 so we're all done with a fancy-looking chocolate so next we have the most hipster of the brands we have endangered species coming in at three dollars and 19 cents now upon discovery I was disheartened that this is chocolate made to advocate for endangered species not chocolate made of endangered species I know common misconception but I'm still disappointed and then look at this 10% net profits donated it's it's gluten free and unlike the other chocolates it has a 48 percent cocoa which is pretty high compared to the rest of these but yeah I'll just open this up here it looks like the wrapper come with another rapper wait what is this the sea otter in hydraloop curious yes they have to comes with an infographic of the animal that is on the cover which is a sea otter so about the sea otter diet includes searchings clams and alabone sea otters have over 800,000 hairs per square inch you know I'm not gonna read the rest of this this isn't a nature show this is a chocolate review if you're really curious I mean I'm pretty sure they have infographics on their website just look up endangered species chocolate anyways so getting this sickening crap out of here let's get straight to the chocolate so unlike the rest this has been manufactured with the top on the bottom instead of the bottom on the bottom so interesting twenty cylinders flip it over and yeah it comes in Rose a dream and I'll like the rest this is the darkest out of all the milk chocolates so I don't know what qualifies something is milk chocolate I know it depends on the cocoa content but I don't know what's the threshold for milk chocolate so yeah those is snapless to open and try this chocolate once again I'm disheartened that this doesn't have like panda or something in it so hmm personally I'm a big fan of dark shadows so I don't see myself buying more on this as dark chocolate but not as a milk chocolate have you compared to most milk chocolates I like this the most cuz it's pretty dark in flavor but once again the sacrifices milkiness for darkness so I mean it really depends on which way you want to go with these I'm personally gonna give these a 6 out of 10 if you're a baby fan or dark chocolate and want something that technically classifies there's no chocolate go for native species so we come to our last our last chocolate the most expensive one I'm up here coming at three dollars and 49 cents we have rip-rip richer sport chocolate unlike the recipes this is probably the most generic packaging money doesn't it doesn't say oh you rich people eat me I mean all it says is made with 100% milk from the Alps now I don't know what's the main difference between milk from meows and nope here is but I mean can't be that much of a difference try this chocolate made with fine European and natural ingredients open so so unlike the rest of the plastic covers this is easily the hardest one to open like I just can't just just open okay yeah all the other chocolates this one has is the most Italy it's the most it's the one that sticks out the most this is pretty milky hey me but this is also pretty milky - let me compare the two out of the chocolates on the milk deists milk chocolates I gotta say we're sports a win um linden it's pretty smoky but it's more of a creaminess like a heavier cream now this is more milky itself so I'm gonna give it to Ritter Sports anyways that concludes this video I hope you guys enjoy there are no other chocolates here oh wait a minute do you know we got the truck chocolate Oh yeah we got it yeah you did you freaking thought that I gotta cook baby you know we have it here Oh all right I'll be there in 10 minutes all right so one dinner session with dad later and we were finally to the Trump chocolate now in the trunk chocolate can you defeat all the other chocolates in the election which brain has the best milk chocolate I guess we're gonna have to find out man I like how Trump like the name is bigger than milk chocolate itself yeah it's good marketing really signifying why you're buying this for but yeah it isn't gold foil and whoa no I I started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars let's flip it over boom dude look at this so there's some like vine so it comes in eight pieces this is the smallest of the pieces anyways it is time to try the Trump chocolate this was five dollars whatever let's try it I just had dinner this should be better all right moment of truth can this beat all the other chocolates dude this is a Hershey's chocolate I mean I like that it only has five ingredients but man five dollars money spent money wasted man this what the Frick is this look at that whoa what what's that I mean what do you think of the chocolate branch you try some please don't tell me is it always to $5 I'll try with the oshi's it's like it's not special is it I mean how is it to the Hershey's chocolate would say rated 5 out of 10 Percy is it a bit more sugary yeah but this is that's one that's like 138 for $5.00 yeah this this Trump talking only less than half of the Hershey's I ounce wise so you could buy like yeah you can buy like three of these for one of those but it's just buying buying two of those two of the Trump ones what give you the amount of chocolate one of the Hershey's gives you well during a year the Trump brand is not worth it five dollars this is for this name whatever I guess I'll just give the leftovers to the Conservative Club at score or whatever okay well that wraps something like chocolate review um I hope you guys enjoyed this video like comment subscribe and stuff you know and all that jazz and I don't see you guys later Jesus

that bite like uh like a Hershey's or something does yeah it's really smooth really really good really creamy and I love the white oh yeah I love that the flavor of that white chocolate that's that's very very nice so what is this a strawberry cream there's a little package we have to cross the president like that for a tour one time it was the only thing and I say this every time we review these oh yeah every time we review these is looks like was soaked balls you put into the bathtub the fizzy things is because they I know it's their trademark to be the round the balls it makes it harder to eat there's a pinkish colored center yeah it does make it kind of hard to eat cuz you can't just bite it you can't invite it a half you almost have to stick the whole thing in your mouth I have something immediately popular mom kind of reminds me of strawberry milk strawberry milk a little bit mm-hmm that's just like strawberry milk that's good I like to talk about the white chocolate white chocolate better a bit cuz when I make sure we milk with like Nestle's Quik when I was growing up I would about half the glass would be the powder the strawberry powder so you're getting a really really syrupy sweet strawberry flavor that's what that has happened very syrupy sweet strawberry those are excellent those are good I select the chocolate white chocolate better but yeah like the truth cover is really good if you like strawberry Alize are great quality 399 I definitely think it's worth what's the serving size there are five servings in a bag these are four in here oh wow that's five point three ounces I'm a loser yeah and sick so your says three more the month so there's peak there should be fifteen is twelve of those okay okay so I think that's good I think that's a good value I don't know why the strawberry has less I think they should make them all the same size but very good chocolate so if you see the lint give it a try even if they're not these flavors even if they're other flavors I think you'll really like it because it's good quality chocolate yeah they're really good so thanks for watching", "acLPGstXxII": "hey guys two big ideas and today I will be

amaris palazzi from ec department i am going to do a oral presentation on the topic uh history of chocolates before getting into the chocolates we all know what are chocolates and we are all really fond of it so it would be interesting topic let's get into it when most of us hear the word the chocolate we picture a bar a box of bamboons or a bunny the word that comes to mind is probably it not bring and the most adjective would be seen to be as sweet but for about ninety percent of chocolates long history it was strictly a beverage and sugar didn't have anything to do with it i often call chocolates the best known source food that nobody knows anything about it said alexander life a self-described a chocolate education who runs a business called chocolatos of new york city the terminology can be a little confusing but most of the experts these days use the term caco to refer to the plant of earth's being before processing while the term chocolate refers to anything made from the beans she explained coca generally refers to the chocolate in the powdered form although it can also be a british form of cacoo etymologist praise the origin of the word chocolate to acidic word of coke tall which referred to be a better bring brewed from caco beans the latin name for the kaku tree thermobag kaku now let us see how the chocolate is coming chocolate is made from the fruit of kakutris which are native to central of south america the fruits are called as spots and each pot contains around 40 cacoo beans the beans are dried and roasted to create cocoa beans it's unclear exactly when kekkok came on the scene who invented it according to hayes lavish cultural arts curator for the smith towns nationals museum of american indian ancient olympic ports let's see the types of chocolates different forms and flavors or chocolates are produced by varying the quantities of the different ingredients other flavors can be obtained by varying the time on temperature when roasting the beans milk chocolate milk chocolate is a solid chocolate made with milk added in the form of powdered milk liquid milk or condensed milk in 1875 swiss conflictor conflict daniel peter developed the first solid milk chocolate using the condensed milk which had been invented by henry nestle european union regulations specify of a minimum 25 percent of cocoa solids however an agreement was reached in 2000 that download an exception from these regulations in uk ireland and malta where milk chocolates can contain only twenty percent of coca-cola such chocolate is lived as family milk chocolate elsewhere in the cadbury union elsewhere in the european union cadbury is a leading brand of milk chocolate in the united kingdom united states of government requires 10 con 10 concentration of the chocolate liquor next let's see the dark chocolate dark chocolate is also known as plain chocolate is produced using a higher percentage of cocoa with all fat content coming from cocoa butter instead of milk but there is also a dark milk chocolates and many degrees of fibroids dark chocolate can be eaten as or are using in cooking next let's see about the white chocolate white chocolate is made of sugar milk and cocoa butter without the cocoa solids it is a pale every color and lacks many of the dark chocolates it remains solid at room temperature as it is below the melting point of cocoa butter so that's it about the chocolates i think this topic uh we've downloaded how the chocolates are made and what are types of chocolates so thanking you that's it about the

not the way we transmitted this product is to be the same or very close to the Mochaccino that you currently have at your local companies this choc glad you took a while to develop the reason being is not cheese melting points the idea the way we produce this is the second that it goes in your mouth that you start smelling it fast and when it melts fast it could become as creamy not creamy texture and then you get that rush of coffee around the sides of your mouth there yeah the way to describe is more of a flawless creamy texture which is one is ideal for coffee Louis chocolate lovers anybody that likes the mocha to know basically so the cocoa beans that we use for this or cocoa beans are your default users is Fairtrade it's vegan friendly they are tea the non-gmo non-gmo means genetically

and welcome to the first episode of reclaiming chocolates and confections a series where i attempt to make artisanal versions of mass-produced candies now i realize that this video idea is in no way a novel one there are many youtube channels that make similar videos the most notable channel being bon appetit in their video series called gourmet mix where we watch the very talented claire saffits attempt to make gourmet versions of beloved mass manufactured snacks not limited to confections and she does so with varying degrees of success contrast that to my videos my videos will be very technical i want to walk you through the science and the techniques needed to make each confection and also provide you with the recipe that you should be able to reproduce at home with that said i will be referencing back to some episodes of gourmet makes either to build off of the work that claire has already done or to answer specific questions that were left unresolved okay so yeah enough with the prelude let's just get started the first candy bar that we're going to tackle is three musketeers largely because i want to address that elusive nougat that we see in a lot of candy bars you know that that nougat that has a fluffy short tender texture that seems to leave everyone confused look at the texture of them i know it's i know what is that why they call it nougat so fluffy i don't know i understand that so before i explain how candy makers achieve this texture i think it'd be helpful to have a better understanding of what nuget actually is nougat is an example of an aerated confection and like all aerated confections the goal is to incorporate gas into a sugar mixture and stabilize the mixture before the gas has a chance to escape the general protocol for making nougat is as follows you whip egg whites to soft for medium peaks then gradually add a hot sugar mixture to the whipping egg whites and continue beating until you've incorporated as much air as you can and the mixture begins to cool while it's procedurally simple there's actually a lot happening at the molecular level when you whip egg whites proteins in the egg whites uncoil or denature and form a thin film around each of the air bubbles that you've introduced through whipping as you continue to whip the egg whites the protein coatings link together eventually creating a network of proteins that further reinforces the walls of the air bubbles and at this point you've created a liquid foam so millions of tiny air bubbles are dispersed throughout the water that's present in the egg whites this liquid foam however is relatively unstable eventually the air bubbles will coalesce form larger bubbles and escape so how can we stabilize this foam we can stabilize the foam by slowly introducing a hot sugar mixture into the whipping egg whites the hot sugar induces thermal coagulation of egg proteins which stabilizes the foam and the sugar prevents further changes in air bubble size and distribution so before you had many microscopic air bubbles dispersed through water now you have many microscopic air bubbles dispersed through a sugar matrix and you've created nougat okay so i hope you're still with me this is where things get interesting nougat can be found in either a grained form or an ungrained form depending on the state of the sugar matrix the sugar matrix in an ungrained nougat contains no sugar crystals in other words the sugar matrix is completely amorphous and this type of nougat has a chewy texture the sugar matrix of a grained nougat on the other hand contains numerous small sugar crystals and it's the presence of these sugar crystals that leads to a short tender textured nougat so the nougat and the three musketeers bar is an example of a grained nougat to make grained nougat candy makers intentionally induce crystallization in the sugar matrix and they do this by adding either fondant or confectioners sugar to the whipped nougat mixture in a process called seeding so let me back up and define what a crystal is a crystal is a solid substance in which atoms molecules or ions are arranged in an orderly repeating pattern extending in three spatial dimensions if you look at confectioner's sugar under a microscope you realize that it's actually made up of a bunch of tiny sugar crystals specifically sucrose crystals when you add these crystals to a nougat mixture they act as seed crystals telling other sucrose molecules in the sugar matrix of the nougat how to organize or crystallize in a more orderly fashion so crystal formation is not instantaneous it takes the sugar matrix approximately 24 to 48 hours after you've added the seed crystals to finish crystallization okay so now that you understand the science let's move on to actually making an artisanal three musketeer star the nougat formulation that i'll be using is from this book chocolates and confections by peter p grueling known to some as the bible of artisan confectionary the ingredient amounts are listed below in the description box okay so the first thing we need to do is prepare our confectionary frame this is the container that we're going to deposit our finished nougat in here i have four aluminum bars measuring 12 inches in length 0.5 inches in height and 0.5 inches in width i've arranged the bars to create a frame with internal dimensions of 11.5 inches by 11.5 inches and i've taped the bars together to prevent them from shifting around when i spread the nougat into the frame to prevent the nougat from sticking to the frame i've applied a thin layer of oil to the interior walls and place the frame on top of an oiled piece of parchment paper the nougat in a three musketeer spa is a grained chocolate nougat so before heating our sugar or whipping our egg whites we need to prepare our nougat flavorings in our seed mixture start by melting the dark chocolate and the cocoa butter together over a water bath the chocolate in this mixture will flavor the nougat and the cocoa butter along with the seed mixture helps to shorten the texture of the nougat making the candy less chewy once the two are completely melted set the mixture aside keeping it warm until we need it we aren't going to add this mixture to the nougat until the very end after we finished whipping the nougat next sift together the pulverized milk powder cocoa powder and confectioners sugar and set this mixture aside we're going to use this mixture later down the road to seed the nougat combine the egg whites and the 25 grams of glucose syrup i'm using corn syrup in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and set this mixture aside we are going to start whipping the egg whites until we've heated our sugar mixture to 112 degrees celsius 234 degrees fahrenheit okay now that we have the flavor mixture seed mixture and egg white mixture prepared we can move on to making the sugar mixture to make the sugar mixture combine 540 grams of glucose syrup the sugar and the water in a pot and heat the mixture to a temperature of 112 degrees celsius 234 degrees fahrenheit over medium high heat as the syrup comes to a boil stir the mixture to ensure that the sugar crystals dissolve quickly and completely any undissolved sugar crystals will act as seeds that promote crystallization of the solution which is something that we don't want when the solution begins to boil stop stirring any form of vegetation at this point can cause the mixture to crystallize and if you see any sugar residue on the sides of the pot use a wet pastry brush to dissolve them away repeat this as often as necessary to keep the sides of the pot clean once the sugar mixture reaches 112 degrees celsius 234 degrees fahrenheit start whipping the egg white mixture on medium-high speed and continue cooking the sugar mixture to 118 degrees celsius 245 degrees fahrenheit if the egg whites reach soft peaks before the sugar mixture reaches 118 degrees celsius stop whisking until the sugar reaches the target temperature once the sugar mixture reaches 118 degrees celsius 245 degrees fahrenheit remove the mixture from the heat and stream the hot syrup into the whipping egg whites using the side of the bowl as a guide avoid pouring the syrup on the moving whisk since that's just going to fling the syrup onto the sides of the bowl and not actually into your whipping egg white mixture this can be hard to do depending on the size and shape of your whisk but just try your best the hot sugar mixture should be added to the whipping egg whites as quickly as the whites will accept the syrup without collapsing but do not dump the syrup all in at once this will deflate the whites resulting in a dense low volume nougat continue to aerate the mixture by whipping it until it has cooled to 50 degrees celsius 122 fahrenheit or until the machine has slowed significantly approximately 10 to 15 minutes add the vanilla extract and whisk to incorporate using a silicone spatula mix in the reserved melted chocolate mixture by hand then mix in the sifted dry ingredients by hand you want to incorporate these two components while the nougat is still warm and supple so work as quickly as possible you'll notice that it becomes increasingly difficult to incorporate these two components as the mixture cools but do not panic just try to be as thorough as possible cleaning off the sides of the bowl as best you can and also making sure you scrape underneath the mixture chances are that there's still some unincorporated nougat at the bottom of the bowl now spread the nougat into the prepared frame place a second piece of oiled parchment paper on top and using a rolling pin level the top of the nougat allow the nougat to cool to room temperature okay now that we've made the nougat we can move on to tempering the chocolate and if you already know how to temper chocolate and the science behind it feel free to skip ahead when you temper chocolate what you're actually trying to do is control how the fat in the chocolate crystallizes in other words you're trying to control how the cocoa butter in the chocolate crystallizes or solidifies the fat molecules that make up cocoa butter can organize themselves into six different crystalline forms each form has a unique melting point and each form has unique eating characteristics the primary purpose of tempering is to make sure that the fat molecules in the chocolate crystallized primarily in form five this crystalline form is the most stable form that we can obtain from melted cocoa butter and it leads to a chocolate that's glossy snappy shelf stable at room temperature and melts in your mouth and not in your hands okay so how do we guarantee that the fat in our melted chocolate sets up in the form 5 configuration and not the other unstable crystalline forms we use seed crystals specifically we use form five seed crystals and this is the same concept we used when making the grained nougat with two main differences the first difference when making the grained nougat we're trying to control the crystallization of sugar now when dealing with chocolate we're trying to control the crystallization of fat the second difference is rather than introducing a foreign source of crystals like we did when graining our nougat we're actually going to form these seed crystals in the melted chocolate itself by following this temperature curve this is one method of tempering chocolate it's the most widely used method by manufacturers and it's the one i'll be demonstrating in this video there are other tempering methods that use a foreign source of crystals to seed the chocolate but we're not going to be talking about it in this video okay so again the take-home message is that the function of tempering is to crystallize a small percentage of the cocoa butter in stable form five crystals so that when the remainder of the liquid cocoa butter crystallizes or solidifies it will crystallize in form five and here's one method of doing that first heat the chocolate over a water bath to 50 degrees celsius 122 fahrenheit to melt away all cocoa butter crystals now cool the chocolate to 27 degrees celsius 81 fahrenheit agitating the mixture to promote crystal formation at this temperature two types of crystals will be forming form four and form five the next thing we need to do is increase the chocolate's temperature to 32 degrees celsius 90 degrees fahrenheit this melts away the form 4 crystals leaving only form 5 crystals and 32 degrees celsius 90 fahrenheit is the ideal working temperature for dark chocolate so we want to keep our chocolate at this temperature when dipping the nougat centers you can maintain the temperature of your chocolate using whatever method you'd like i like to use my immersion circulator set at 32 degrees celsius 90 degrees fahrenheit we're first going to use this tempered chocolate to pre-coat the bottom side of the nougat's lab with a thin layer of tempered chocolate this process of pre-coating is also known as bottoming because the thin layer of chocolate will be the bottom layer of the confection pre-coated centers are easier to handle because the bottom coat of chocolate prevents the soft center i.e the nougat from sticking to the dipping fork and it also helps the center maintain its shape to pre-coat the nougat slab pour approximately four tablespoons of chocolate to cover the bottom of the nougat once this thin layer of chocolate begins to set remove the nougat from the frame and cut the slab of nougat into pieces measuring 1.5 inches by 0.5 inches this is possibly the hardest and the most boring part of confectionary work in my opinion if you don't own a guitar cutter which i like most people unfortunately don't so to make sure that my nougat pieces have nearly identical dimensions i sketch out the portion size of each nougat on the top parchment paper then use a clean sewing needle to perforate through the paper and the nougat and use these perforations as guides when cutting the slab of candy once you finish cutting your nougat you can rope each piece in tempered chocolate using whatever method you'd like i personally like to use what's called the turning method where you first flip the nougat upside down so that the pre-coated bottom is facing upward then gently press the nougat into the chocolate until the top of the nougat is level with the chocolate surface using a dipping fork press down on one side of the nougat to make it roll 180 degrees in the chocolate then lift the nougat center out of the chocolate and tap the nougat against the surface of the chocolate this action pulls off excess chocolate allowing you to form a thinner chocolate coating clean the bottom of the chocolate covered nougat against the edge of the container and gently transfer it onto parchment paper this last part takes a bit of practice from time to time clean the excess chocolate off the fork with a paper towel a clean fork makes it easier for the center to slide off when you're transferring the dipped center onto parchment paper after you've finished dipping all your nougat centers leave them undisturbed for 24 hours well-tempered chocolate begins to set or crystallize very quickly but it still takes several hours for all the fat molecules to finish crystallizing okay so there you have it a artisanal three musketeers bar and i really want to demonstrate the texture of this grained nougat so please enjoy the following footage [Music] bye so there's a lot of information in this video i hope it'll serve as a useful resource for food enthusiasts and anyone who's interested in making this at home i hope you enjoyed the video i hope you learned something new and if you did like and subscribe anyway if you have questions feel free to send them my way you can find me right here on these social media platforms okay thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video yeah so the whole idea of making artisanal or gourmet versions of these mass manufactured candy bars is actually kind of an interesting and complex topic because the original versions of these candy bars were artisanal versions like in the 1800s if you wanted candy you just go to your local artisan confectioner to get your candy fix um and then later on these industrial producers came in took these recipes tweaked them a little bit to make them amendable for mass production and because they had the economies of scale on their side they were essentially able to obliterate the local artisan confectioner", "m45DNfMgMbA": "hi everyone and welcome back to my channel i'm going to be doing some baking today as it's my granddaughter lexi's sixth birthday party tomorrow so i'm planning on doing some mars bar krispies and also if i've time uh good old-fashioned a sprinkle cake so i'll just show you the ingredients and then we'll get started of butter and that needs to be softened we have four mars bars chopped i've got three chopped there and i've got the other one there because we put three in with the butter and the syrup uh we need one and a half tablespoons of golden syrup so i've got the syrup there and we need 150 grams of rice krispies and 350 grams of milk chocolate 50 grams of white chocolate and you need to lightly grease and add some baking paper into whatever you want whatever dish you're going to be using and you're going to be having like a bamboo for melting a the butter and the chocolate but in the meantime we'll put our butter in so we're going to soften our butter and our three mars bars and one and a half tablespoons of syrup so i'll just do that and then i'll give that to you right so we're just letting that melt down done and with the next bit right you then add your rice crispy mixture into your buttered a dish and then lightly press down with a potato masher or something just to make sure all the crispies stick together and then you'll just set that aside so in the meantime get another pan of a boiling water and let it simmer away and melt your milk chocolate so we'll just get that done not sure chocolate's starting to melt away there so we'll just finish that off and then we pour that over our crispy mixture right just pour the melted chocolate over the top now and then with your milk chocolate we're just going to drizzle some over that and then with a skewer just lightly move it about it's meant to look like fans but just making sure [Music] each little section has got a bit of white chocolate yeah i don't think that looks too bad with that and so everyone we will then chill in the fridge and and remove it and leave for a little while before you cut it into squares so that

the commercial growing up when um it shows somebody putting peanut butter in chocolate and how's that how did that commercial go man i can't remember it's like it was like someone took a piece of chocolate and put it in a thing of peanut butter and he took it out and tasted as like like a light bulb went off or something i didn't show something like that but i think that was kind of the the digest of it you know what i mean but anyway milk chocolate peanut butter that's what it says glow-in-the-dark wrapper another one from past halloween um on the entry table at work i just grabbed one one of each of the candy bars it says this is best by 2021 so they stay good for a while well this one doesn't look like it has much of a sign that it's been melted in a vehicle before it got here it looks like it's all right the other two kind of had that kind of look about it but getting the chocolate you can get the although you can't see the peanut butter right now you get it right through the through the top the peanut butter smells good oh yeah this has been melted yeah it's not in real good shape you can tell it's is kind of not coming out very good of the wrapper it's kind of sticking

it looks like a rectangle but is there any way I can know for sure that it's a rectum you can there are safety properties erected what are those chocolate mark the six properties of erecting or as such as you can see here the first property of a rectangle is that the opposite sides are parallel as such they also have another set of parallel lines down this way they also have four 90-degree angles in every corner right here one two three four they also add the diagonals correct right here they bisect each other and they are congruent they also had form two sets of isosceles triangles like one two three so to each the last property of rectangles that has two sets of congruent sides so you're telling me that this chocolate bar has all six properties of rectangles right it has four 90-degree angles yes it has two congruent diagonals yes they both bisect each other yes it creates four isosceles triangles yes again and all four sides are parallel to their opposites and congruent yeah Wow that is insane how much does a chocolate bar like that cost you this only here trouble because five dollars only five dollars that's a fantastic deal and now a few words both chocolate mark

[Music] [Music] [Music] you", "CUKOIhkXW0I": "ready we're ready okay we're streaming live to the world oh my gosh hello world hello everyone all right say some stuff all right hey guys today we're going to be making chocolate covered spirulina brittle we made a i believe hemp brittle a while back and it's really similar to doing that so we're just going to go ahead and dive in unless russell james has anything he'd like to say um i don't think so no interesting okay let's get started then and if you have any questions you can go ahead and ask and russell um field those over to me in due time so what we're doing and the recipe is below the video so you can grab the recipe link there and then there's actually another video you can watch in there on how to make it it might be slightly different than we're going to do it today and there's a recipe on my website where a post on my website about how to temper chocolate so we're not going to temper it today but you can go to my website and learn how to do that if you just go to the site and then go to the search box you can put in tempering and it'll bring up all the different ways on the site that we go through that so i've got the desiccated coconut here which you'll see in the recipe i've had it draining for a little while we want to get a lot of this excess water off otherwise it'll dilute the mixture so we're going to tip this into the bowl and then we're going to add our other ingredients in so we'll start with some maple syrup and really adding this gives a little bit of liquid it'll help the coconut sugar to dissolve because the coconut sugar will dissolve against liquid so the liquid that's in the coconut will also help it but the maple syrup will help too so we'll get the coconut sugar in i use powdered but you don't have to it's not a requirement it'll it'll go down to a syrup anyway so it doesn't matter if it's not powdered this is coconut flour and that helps bind everything together and then we have our spirulina so i use this is one that's actually from a company called tree harvest here in the uk um but a really good other other really good brands are live stream and micro organics those are both really nice the spirulina is really creamy and kind of sweet it doesn't have that fishy fishy taste or element to it and so we'll just add that in now and then we're just going to go in with a little bit of some flavoring here so i've got some vanilla extract and this is from medicine flour i'm just going to throw a few drops of that in if you don't have it you can use vanilla powder or whatever kind of vanilla that you like to use and then we've got peppermint extract here so this is a peppermint sorry not extract essential oil we're going to really load that up get that flavor through there and that also helps cut through the flavor of the spirulina as well plus the sugar doesn't doesn't hurt either to help that move through a bit and then we just get that mixed up nice and good and well all things i had a dream the other night that we were doing a live stream and you didn't really talk russell what have you done sorry i was just trying to find your video so i could see comments and stuff all right and uh headed over to video and then what started watching the video and then the audio came through it's a cool thing so that's how it happened right okay we've got some people i i couldn't find my way to the the the facebook i was wondering why you were so quiet raw chef mandy hello from singapore hello we've got de havlin from uh from uh from atlanta georgia out there hello um oh so sarah can you just repeat uh no sorry sarah is saying that yeah she did not hear what you said about the uh the spirulina not having a fishy flavor yeah so there's certain brands that you can get especially like i think essentially you want to avoid the ones that come from i think it was china i can't remember but there's also a particular time of year when it's harvested um so the people that you get it from should purchase it around a particular time of year so it has a really sweet kind of creamy flavor to it and and feel to it rather than that fishy taste that you can get from seaweed powders often and i use tree harvest in the uk but live stream i think it's called live stream i'm pretty sure live stream is a really great brand and so is micro organics you can find both of those on amazon so now we've got the mixture all ready to go here so i'm going to pop this onto the teflex sheet russell i see your hand up and i'm going to need you to go ahead and just hold that tight i know but i need you to hold tight just for a moment okay this question i'm going to spread and then you can ask him okay or the old spread classic so he now he's here you see when he when he comes to the party then things start picking up a little bit otherwise i'm just over here like okay go ahead i'm going to spread this out all right catherine harvey's here oh my gosh i was thinking of harvey harvey oswald jr this morning and wondering why she doesn't ever come but there she is she is showing up what up oz um i hope you're not out assassinating anybody at the moment that's an inside joke she's not an assassin no she says we're having a domestic eric's here hello chef hi eric um say his last name well done lcrs it just how does one even he might be able to phonetic phoneticize it for you yeah it's totally a word ozzy don't start let me see let me see let me see um because we had a question here from priya priya patil uh hello from charlotte's charlotte nc new news you got this you got it go ahead north carolina north carolina new newfoundland um i was going to say new connecticut i'm just making yeah you have steaks um what flavors go well flavors work in this recipe it's peppermint i love the vanilla but my kids don't like mint ooh the downside of having kids just kidding just kidding just kidding also um eric lacrosse lacrosse yeah okay um gosh i'm not sure what else would go i mean because because it's green my head goes to green so i start thinking like with lime lime would work lime would probably be nice uh well i know lemon definitely works so yeah lime would be really nice i wouldn't do the zest because lime zest can go really weird when you dehydrate it it can kind of get like take on a bitterness and lose the nice fresh flavor of it so i think lime would work well or if you had the medicine flower lime the silver line the one that has this black cap on it they do a lime and it's actually really nice i was skeptical about it but i really like it a lot so i think that's kind of like maybe green apple or that might be a little bit weird yeah i don't know russell can you think of anything else no i like the lime yeah i think lemon or lime will work what about uh going like a mojito like lime and basil yeah that's mint russell and then we're back to the same problem again yeah but basil basil and lime you can do it's a bit it's a bit unusual but it's unusual i mean would her kids like it if they don't like peppermint oh hang on what am i talking about what is he talking about vanilla vanilla basil yeah lion yeah but there's no spirulina yes so are you taking that into account as you're thinking this through like oh it tastes like spirulina also great greens yeah we're just having a bit of a constituency oh anyway may i or i mean i think you could yeah i've also just before you do yeah interesting interesting no in fact yeah um just hopping over to the to the youtubes yeah um this is how we drew yeah sure what up drew he's saying hi it's drew yeah we get that from your username buddy tiffany robbins hi amy come to philly soon tiffany hello she came to my classes in philly ages and ages ago he gives me looks when he does when i know someone and he doesn't it's a problem lisa is is coming in with the idea here or three years i just saw it where's it gone i'm gonna just score this while we do this you just watch me do this it just said spatula matcha oh yeah thank you yeah of course it does see that um lisa what's her last name i don't know it seems to have the comment seems to have gone um but thank you lisa susan's here nuri is here hello hello hello oh susan warwood yes hi susan warwood and hi norit lisa vigo got lisa [Laughter] i really like to just throw myself into those yeah you do yeah give it a go yeah he loves it sorry if i got it wrong i'm gonna go ahead and teach still yeah that's right all right is catherine harvey still with us she'll be loving this yeah no she does she says that we're cracking her up we're such a great guy all right look so we got that scored then that goes into the dehydrator and we're going to put it on whatever temperature you want obviously the higher you set it the quicker it's going to dry with this particular recipe it's not very wet going in so if you left it on the sheet and you did a kind of higher temperature let's say above kind of six o'clock on the dehydrator this will dry pretty well even with the sheet underneath it but you can always flip it off of the sheet and then take take this off and it'll just dry on the mesh and then you'll get a nice full circulation there so what it looks like when it comes out is it i traveled over here with it so it broke apart in the on the way over but it'll just come like this and it's really easy just to break it now you can see it has this kind of rough edge on it and some of these i've shaved down where do i need to put this so people can see it more more better all right so this is really clean and this has a little bit of uh et cetera yeah rough edge that's he has the words i have the do the thing [Laughter] okay so i've got a microplane here so i'm just going to take this and gently like you're filing your nails you guys file her down is there another name for those from the us is it called something else what's the name for what microplane in the us is it i think it's the same thing so that's it and you don't get a whole lot that comes off of it either this powder you know for those of you who don't like waste if there's something that you want to do with it you know go for it sprinkle on your porridge et cetera sure and just in case you're wondering i know you were just wondering i am it's uh lisa vijay got okay great thanks he's a first and last name kind of guy he watches and listens to podcasts and so when he tells me about them when he tells me about them oh yeah i get it i get a first name last name situation always with this guy and every and every time though what if i say oh i listen to tim's podcast the [Music] no i'd be like cool because i don't care i don't only because i don't listen to them russell so like if i was like oh yeah okay well can you tell me the last name so i can look it up you know what i mean maybe sometimes like let the person ask a question you know what i mean how did this end up here i don't know i don't know never mind let's move on okay so then you have these all prepared and i've got a bowl of tempered chocolate here it's just it's been on top of the dehydrator just holding let's just see okay any questions at the moment russell um tiffany robbins is saying wood rasp equals mice plane i think what she's saying microplane yeah microplane um the old autocorrector yeah wood rasp yeah a rasp yes that's what it is tiffany oh right okay because i'd heard another chef on a video talk about he was like doing this thing in the uk and he had a microplane what's his name his name is matty matheson there you go is that how it should work yeah you have to ask for the name i just say a chef what's his name yeah that's right it would be nice if it was because you're interested oh no now we're definitely having a full-on domestic now we're definitely getting there really showing people our true colors okay so we're just gonna take this and we're going to dip it in the chocolate makes sense absolutely smartest kind of smallest smartest just because there's kids on you know that that autocorrects will get you tiffany halfway through saying mice plane i realized what had happened there i wasn't trying to be here facetious um alyssa o'connor what ingredients make up the base i miss the first few minutes look great well i'm amy's going to tell you in a second but also elisa um this will be on replay just straight after so you can watch it but also but also take it away but also uh there's a link under the video to the recipe but the base of it is desiccated coconut um priya is asking what's the advantage of using a microplane versus a cookie cutter like you used for the brit the other brittle you made can't remember which uh i think you're getting things a little bit mixed up because the microplane is just for shaving down the sides we didn't use a cutter to cut this we used um i used an offset spatula just to score it um the different there's not really a difference uh what's the difference well the difference between scoring it the way that i did today is that they're all going to be slightly different and if you use a cutter they'll all be pretty much exactly the same in terms of the size of them but i mean i don't think i did too shabby here but if you wanted them to be like kind of perfect then you could use a cutter instead the next one you put down can you put it underneath the current line you've got because what you're saying is it's out of shape you see yeah i have i tend to have issues with like what's in shot what's that a shot okay he wasn't going to say it but like i will so and then these you want to store in an airtight container because the coconut will go soft otherwise so once they're once they're dipped and then you can put them in the fridge for a few minutes to set it won't take long or you or they'll set at room temperature for after like 10-15 minutes then you can put them in the fridge or whatever you're going gonna do to set them and then store them in airtight container like i've got over here um for like months they'll be fine unless rustles around and then they'll be gone it's truth truth and no one's gonna blame me for that no for sure look that's what you it's what you all the things and it's what you get for being friends with me treats glitter i'll take it yeah all right so that's it my friends any questions to finish up here russell james questions comments concerns you can bring the whole tray down life problems just did it again awesome there we go there they are um all right well maybe whilst if anyone wants to because there's a little bit of a delay here if anyone wants to type in any uh any final questions here before we finish uh maybe if you could say some stuff about what you'd like to say just uh you know break it down what what let's give me something what are the some of the links get specific what do you mean that like you want to talk about your live streams you want to talk about the design schools i thought you were going to say do you want to talk about your life you want to talk about like the dessert the raw chocolate mini course we just filmed that was going to be up soon it sounds like you want to talk about that i'm just giving you options so we just before this filmed a raw chocolate mini course and so we used the blender to make chocolate we use the stone grinder to make chocolate um and we demo all of this in the mini course and that's going to be ready apparently friday in russell james terms but probably it's more going to be like in a few weeks so they know people who know no it's fine but like we like to just give a little bit more time because you don't know what can happen like the camera can have an issue the cam link the cords all kinds of stuff oh um we made some bars do you want to just grab one of the cut pieces by the sides member and then you can show the people what we made yeah that's right you got the right of it i can eat this a little bit like you can like i thought maybe we'd use it in the photo but whatever get it get it in the box get it there we go all right he's got it so we made these chocolate bars with texture so i put freeze-dried fruit and some chopped nuts and cocoa nibs and some extracts in there we show you how to use a polycarbonate mold and how to temper the chocolate as well so that will be ready you know when it's ready etc do you want to try one of these russell james because these see see this is only been a few minutes and they're starting to set if i have to you do it's obligatory take it before i don't take it [Music] i've had too many treats today so i'm just gonna you haven't had nearly as many as you normally would i'm cutting down yeah i think you're doing good work i'm gonna no i'm gonna i'm gonna go manual package because it is quite delightful you don't do you taste the coconut like a lot because i find that you don't really get the coconut taste as much and you get this kind of creamy creamy sweet peppermint especially with the dark chocolate pairs really well you can have it just without and i've given it to a lot of people before i started dipping in chocolate i gave it to a lot of people like this and it's it's awesome like it's just a really fun snack and i think i think kids would like it because it's green but having not had kids myself i don't know this is really delightful as it turns out i'm gonna eat the whole thing he's he's enjoying it what's happening yeah we knew that was going to happen beautiful all right well anything else um you're all desserts dot com yeah that's under the video raw desserts course dot com we cover fermented cashew cream and then we use that in a few different recipes so we make a cheesecake we make some doughnuts some raw doughnuts with a marble glaze it's free by the way that's capital f-r-e-e-free no email required you just go ahead and like totally like anonymous like no one's asking you for anything and then what's the other thing oh we do like pears like candied kind of pears that we do in the dehydrator and then we do that with a fermented nutmeg kind of uh what's it called serving cream it's mucho delightful nacho delicious um lisa yeah it's like oh that's russell james yeah the russell james that's right and i'm amy levin so oh um could you double the vanilla instead of adding peppermint i'd say like just don't double the vanilla probably like it might just be too much so you could just take the peppermint out in which case you might just want to have a little like touch of lemon juice in there that might be nice to neutralize the spirulina because i think the peppermint neutralizes it a little bit meaning it softens out that flavor so the lemon would also do that too oh lisa's saying oh last names though she was impressed by me no she wasn't [Laughter] amy thanks for coming okay bye bye harvey bye drew bye everybody who came thank you bye wave", "28xsxy6GE_0":

"welcome to Andy reviews candy my name's Andy and I review Candy Man urban age calendar today we're taking a look at two Ritter sport hazelnut bars one is milk chocolate when is dark chocolate now right off the bat I want to make it clear that yes Ritter sport is higher quality chocolate then let's say Hershey Mars or Nestle however it's far from artisan Ritter sport is pretty much the same level as Jared deli when it comes to quality of chocolate it's below Lent but it's higher than Cadbury although Ritter sport is far from artisan it's definitely much higher quality chocolate than let's say her share Mars so I'll take that into account during the grading one big thing I want to note about these before I open them up is just how thick they are they're actually almost as thick as two Hershey bar stacked together wow you can really see those hazelnuts another unique aspect of these chocolates is the shape their squares now that might not seem important but it's actually very unique so Oh defect let's break these apart that did not break apart well write or read or Ritter you can't do this her she has no problem breaking stuff apart but you can't have these big giant like you can't just have your hazelnuts just destroying the process so in each square you have approximately one whole hazelnut let's see if it's good I mean it's good I don't particularly care about it but it's good I don't know the thick chocolate is actually really nice but there's just something about it that I'm just not feeling maybe the dark will do the trick for me that is more like it this one is three hazelnuts in it I'm really not feeling this one either surprisingly I actually think I like this one less than milk chocolate like it's okay dark chocolate seems like it's a pretty high cocoa percentage so be ready for that but it almost tastes bitter I don't know I'm just not feeling it I mean if you love his nuts maybe you'll really like this all I can say is these things go for like three or four bucks each and they're definitely not worth it there's plenty of other chocolate that's a suspensive that just tastes much much better now that's not to knock over to sport products then make some great candy I'm just not feeling these particular ones now no it's my opinion it's candy I don't know what to tell you", "PSNvShJcVZw": "yeah I went to M&S again orbit this is new but not so new because it's been new for a while M&S white chocolate raspberry and matcha bar so matcha is green tea for those who don't know and for the days when you need something treatment sweet in for a treat smiley face was Bri on top of things and this it's still weird you have to type this code in there's no barcode to scan but that's just then really yeah so what is in this yeah so there's coca part so there's the why so freeze dried raspberries droid matcha green tea and stuff let me sit with vegetarians so you can have this as a vegetarian I wonder what this is gonna be like I'm assuming this is gonna be lately tea flavored Basri chocolate if I go out on a limb if I can actually open the packet if I can open the packet in the next three weeks that would be great umm it's brain it doesn't look like it well there's one for I am the ones 4 p.m. and it's green just a green with red bits now it looks like something's not well and to give you an idea when I film this this is the time of day so when you smell it you definitely smell the matcha there's a predominant smell the smell of tea so let's take a bite that's why it's lunchtime hmm so white chocolate predominant flavor green tea miss Berkeley rather bring it surprisingly nice I'm glad I've got this one I think I prefer this over the previous one I did a while back yeah this is nice go to your local I was going to say another company there for a minute what was lady your Marxist box whether it's a store or food hall or whatever kind of things they have or it's not the one I saw the other day there's you know Sainsbury's which is weird and get yourself some yep okay sell something and have a nibble", "xBjOGHmcMzQ": "this chocolate ganache frosting is fabulous not only can you use it to glaze your doughnuts that we're going to show you after you filled them with custard you can use it to frost brownies you can use the defrost a cake you can use it to spoon out of the jar out of your refrigerator like a little bite of chocolate it's a staple chocolate recipe that I think everybody will want to have around just always have on hand I like to melt it down sometimes after I've set it up if I have some vanilla ice cream that I've made and use that as a drizzle you could use it like a magic shell there's so many things you can do with it so let's get started we're going to start with our sweetener we calls for one cup of either maple syrup or coconut sugar really if you want you could use LeConte au which is a sugar-free sweetener I'm going to use coconut sugar today because it gives it such a good kind of caramely maple leaf flavor so that's why I like to use this in my chocolate and I'm gonna just start by putting my 1 cup into the blender now you'll notice today this time I'm using a smaller blender you can get these on Vitamix they're short if you can see this it's a lot shorter than the regular one I figured I'm making a small batch of chocolate this is a good one to have on hand if you're really serious about being a chef especially a raw food chef I recommend ordering one of these and I think you can get them now from Costco but definitely make sure you order one of these just go online and get the 48 ounce 32 ounce blender Vitamix blender ok the next thing we're gonna add in is some cacao powder about 3/4 of a cup now this is raw cacao powder but you could definitely use cooked chocolate powder if you want to just make sure there's no sweetener added to it it's just pure raw cacao or pure cocoa powder okay so add that in I get mine from Bali right now and I love this cacao powder high in magnesium is just an awesome food next we're going to add in our fat so you got to have a little fat with your chocolate so we want two tablespoons of coconut oil it's not a lot just enough to give it some body this coconut oil is kind of somewhere in between melted and solid it'll make a perfect blending if if it's rock-solid let's say you're in Canada in the winter you're gonna want to defrost it you're gonna want to put it in your you want to shave it down I'm even put in your dehydrator or warm it up somehow before you put it in your blender then the last thing to add in is some salt so I want about you know I'm kind of a little more on the salty side with my sweet so I'm gonna add in about a quarter teaspoon your recipe calls for 1/8 so it's really I'm gonna leave that up to you what I recommend is flavor balancing on your own what that means is once you put your ingredients in you taste it and you think do I like the flavor balance do I like the notes on there if you not you can always add more the last thing I'm going to add in is some water it looks like I've got about half a cup of water here and that's gonna just bring it all together and then we'll blend make sure you get that lid on really tight and then stir don's you sometimes you're gonna get a little air bubble in your chocolate sauce so just give it a shake and I don't know if you heard that probably didn't but it went bloop and the air bubble popped out and so then I'm just gonna blend again okay so don't know make sure that variable speed goes down a lot of times I just push them both down when I stop to make sure I avoid and I don't want to start it with it on high it's gonna jumpstart my heart and maybe the sauce will flip up into the lid and I'll lose some really precious chocolate sauce so start it low this is my favorite part I did the today's date let's see what it tastes like and I like that I was given a really big taste experience hey let's imagine dipping strawberries into that oh it smells so good oh my god I'm so excited I'm serious I'm really excited it's after lunch and I can't wait to try this wow this tastes like a candy bar okay anyway no next I'm going to put it in something so what have you had this little jar of chocolate ganache and you could give this to a friend with a big red bow on it they would be your best friend forever go check all over my face okay so I'm getting goofy because no chocolate but it's seriously this is some follow this recipe exactly and you're gonna adore it so look at this as I pour it out so this is yummy smooth silky right now it's a chocolate sauce but when it sets up the reason I call it ganache is because it gets thick so if I were to put it on a doughnut like use it as a glaze for a donut or you know I might use it in my cinnamon rolls not even cinnamon rolls but my pastry rolls and roll it up as a spiral so you can see that it was a good consistency to it and as I use that for things it as it is it refrigerates it's gonna get solid so I can its scoopable and I can just eat it right out in there or I can like I said I can use it for a frosting use an offset spatula to frost my cake so we'll get more into that as these lessons go and we get more into pastries but we're doing our foundation right now sauces so now you've learned how to do chocolate ganache sauce", "pFFtJg-7etU": "hello welcome to the I demand valve YouTube channel for that review II brand-new from kicker look at this look at that bar it's the KitKat gold look at that that's a

fingers covered with caramel flavor what a milk chocolate it's open this up look at that I'm getting the smell straight away and I'm kind of thinking this is gonna be like you know like a camera Mac that's all been caramel gold bar but look at that for a bar of kicker look at that you know that's not bad it's not bad on a taste it's an acquired taste now if you like Kara Mac in gold bars that's the sort of taste it's going down it don't taste like a KitKat it's just a standard inside there's nothing special to see it on the inside look the world-famous Adam and Val inside the chocolate bar look not much to see you know it's quite nice and I quite like over Mac I quite like them gold buzz and it's that sort of taste on top I mean you get the point for the package something the packet looks looks really good the bar itself looks good it's got the caramel chocolate on that side and it's got dark on that side Oh quite like this it's not buried under standard keep that and it don't taste much like a kicker but it's not bad take it we anything on this channel including flowers my I bet that's gone you know what it weren't bad for review type test of that in the next video [Music]

recipes today I'm going to make some st. Patrick's Day shamrock bark this is just like the Valentine's Day card mark that I made a few weeks ago but I'm using st. Patrick's Day colors and I'm also using a st. Patrick's Day silicone mold the amounts of the ingredients that you're going to need to make the shamrock candy will be listed in the information box below you can find it on the website or the roku channel these are the ingredients that you're going to need you'll need some white melting wafers these are the Ghirardelli brand but you could also use almond bark you'll need some green M&Ms and these are the mint flavored M&Ms you'll need some kind of green sprinkles I have some tiny little shamrocks and then some little just sprinkles that are shaped like a ball that are different colors and white and you'll need a shamrock mold and that's a silicone mold that I got off of Amazon if you can find a smaller one you can make smaller candies I couldn't find a smaller one so this is the one I'm going to use I'm gonna start by melting these chocolate wafers and my little chocolate pot here and this melts the chocolate really well and I'm gonna turn it on milk there's a warm and a melt that I'm going to turn it on now and I'm going to put the little candy in there and I'm just going to watch this and as it starts to melt both stir it so while that's melting I'm going to take my mold and I'm going to distribute some of these candies and these sprinkles so I'm going to put a few of the M&Ms in the bottom of the mold oh that's all of them you can put as many as you want it's gonna kind of cover the bottom here see they're spread out and then I'm going to take these little shamrocks and I'm just going to sprinkle those around again as much as you want then I have my little other ones these are two different colors with green and white and I'm just going to put some of those in okay what I'm going to do is just set this pant aside it's all ready and as soon as the chocolate melts I'll come back and show you the next step I wanted to give you a little close-up of the little shamrock sprinkles that I have in here it's hard to see from far away so I wanted to show you up close what they look like I think they're going to be perfect for this candy my chocolates all melted so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn this off and I'm going to pour this evenly into the molds so I'm going to move that out of the way and pull this over and just start pouring it in and just try to get an even amount these will be big candies but like I said if you can find a smaller silicone mold that would work great you could make a few more and there wouldn't be quite so thick okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go put these on a cookie sheet and then I'm going to right now I'm going to tap it down like this to get all the air bubbles out and there are a few you can see maybe so I'm going to get a cookie sheet I'm going to put it on the cookie sheet I'm going to put this in the refrigerator until they harden up I've had that shamrock bark in the refrigerator so it can harden up and not ready to take it out of the mold so I'm just going to start loosening them up and pop it them out and that's what they look like I'm just going to put them on this tray here great percent Patrick's Day and there they are this is my st.

what's in my mouth i can't i have it very well okay [Music] so i'll go eight because i wish there was a", "kae5UGmFkcQ": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "1sc34VsaNAs": "Hey Ya Ya and today I'm with my brother Owen so today we are making chocolate buttons yeah so what what are we making them which chocolates are we making out so we are making it active in Tesco milk chocolate and test a white chocolate and we have in Tesco everything value plain chocolate which is that but we're not using that one today because bone doesn't like that but yes we're just using the white on the plane I mean the white is enough okay so first what do you think we have to do we have to flip the chocolate into the bowl do that mate right so we've got two moles by here and we go to sponge so right which one do you want hmm I'll do it and I'll do the what chocolate one okay so I'm going to okay so Owen is going to do the white chocolate and I am going to do the milk chocolate this one you have we made me a minute yeah just Rd open we're just going to fit about half the packing his [Music] breaking so what I'll show you as we go so we've got a pan a big pan for like things like that we've got the a non-stick baking paper we are lining we broke up the chocolate so now before we do this we're gonna pop them in the microwave so we are now treating our chocolate into the microwave and we're putting on medium or 22nd I'll say about 30 seconds and then we take it out 50 seconds and then we start it I'll be back when it's finished okay now it's finished um we need to open it and as you consume its kind of started to melt in in some places and they're important it started to melt a bit so now then we'll stir it to about 20 seconds and then we'll put it back in the microwave for about ten I was I been mining for about twenty but mine was less massive in yours and net and we'll catch up when it's quite melty okay so we have read them melted the chocolate and you can choose yes quite runny and you don't want to overheat it because always it will burn and become crispy and horrible yeah yes but just to make sure make sure any little kids doing this make sure you have a lots of revision so I'm looking and looking out for you making sure you're doing or safe make sure you are good to make sure you do have them a lot supervision but anyway on to the next bit like this tray [Music] so once we get the right measurements from the whole thing yeah they don't have to have it perfect you just have to make sure it does line the whole thing very get ready to catch it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] see now it kind of fits pretty much this is about half that will sink so you need to kind of put quite a bit and then you need to write so read it round okay so now we can that's what we use to make the and digging deeper stick to the past so while I'm doing that I'm just going to mix the chocolate bit so it doesn't start to harden then it would be really hard we'd have to do we'd have been off the chocolate then yeah sure okay so how are we there we go stand in your home so we won't get it on your hands when you're doing this but it's underneath okay so now it's it so it doesn't have to be perfect it just has to stick to the ceiling so it doesn't stick right so you want to do wait chocolate or not chocolate now and I could do one right okay so I'll show you what to you yes you start Arden yeah right so we're just gonna grab a little spoonful of the chocolate we're just gonna leave space and just kind of let it drip off into the disk yeah about this much yeah that's fun then just flatten it this is not too flat but it's not too big [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so we are back we have now made all our our top and chocolate buns so how many of you know and I've made nine and annum and Amelia's made 10 and a tiny yeah that tiny window yeah you would put and 2 pounds to finish the rest of then in our fridge this so that's my tiny one and then we've got there's two of arrangement here and the camera is jiggling about and research is one of mine yeah and then there's another one another one another one another one the one another one another one another one then Owens is one two three four five six seven eight nine okay cool okay so what are we doing next doing so now we need to put it put this heart rate in our fridge today it cooled them and and turn into into chocolate that's harder drop yes so we're going to let it set in the fridge for how long do you think and I think about what maybe an hour two or three yeah something like that depends on um how cold your fridges but we were actually probably about two hours yeah yeah okay so let's go see them in the fridge so we're now putting them in the fridge we cleared a space which which is fine yeah we're I'm zooming in on there we go and Owens popping them in can you reach a parent and it perfectly fits in there and now we're going to leave it in there for about two to three hours and we'll check back in when we're finished so we've waited about two hours it's up sleeping in the fridge about two hours because it's 2:30 we put it in about 12:30 so Owen would you like to get out very cold very careful yeah nothing on the table I think we have to we've made up chocolate buttons now we put in the fridge for a few minutes just to keep you

"[Music]", "J-Wg5ELi41M": "[Music] hello chocks and chocolates no one in between chocolate butter for another video review this time we have the cadbury's dairy milk top deck yeah so i'm very excited about this one actually probably sounded a bit too excited but i am excited about this one because well basically it's a funny one because um i always saw this when i was younger and it was always for some reason strangely it was like there was lots of chocolates at the sweet shop and i must be quite young really because these ones are always on the top shelf you know you can never get them and they always look very you know they were too expensive you know for me i was only young at the time and they played about i don't know 20p or something and then you know these are just always very expensive very big bars they're never in small bars i always used to want them most they always look so exquisite and you know they were out of reach of tantalising you know they tantalised me in there and i just yeah i really always wanted them and there's other ones as well and i can't i can't remember any of them this one just stood out to me because i like the name of it and i think at the time it was so unheard of really to have something as as sort of um extravagant or as different or as um indulgent or as we as wacky i guess you'd even say as um as two types of chocolate together it just didn't happen then i remember i was young at the time of course but i just never saw milk and white chocolate together you know um so yeah i was really always excited about but i never had it i never had it and i i stopped being sold as soon as i don't know i'm sure it's just for sale for a long time but you just you never really saw it in the shops and it's probably one of those you'd only find it for some reason at train stations there's always like a random section of chocolate and it's probably one of those you only found there really when i grew up and was old enough to get it i just never saw it you know i just never ever saw it and you know and then and i don't think they do it anymore and this is actually the australian version so just say um what does it say it's just like lovingly made in tasmania or something yeah proudly made in tasmania there we go so i'd have cadbury's australia's in tasmania i think it's in there you know just above the glass and a half there yeah so yeah so this one i found it in there b m in the uk it says it's distributed by place in marple in stockport so um so it might only be you know you might be able to get into many bms it might just be northwest ones um let's say it says spk limited so then here they are doesn't sound it sounds like a distribution place rather than a store um but there we go there we are for whatever reason that's where it's come from but yeah what's interesting though dairy milk um dairy milk milk chocolates with dream white chocolates so he goes it has so so cadbury's dream is still available in us in australia um so it specifically says it's got dream on it not cabbage white but dream so yeah very excited about this one i'm very excited i feel that's really nice i like the way let's say it's got a sort of bus on it as well um for those you don't know top deck is what you call to the other well that's the top deck of a bus i guess or any anything with decks i guess but well yeah they're not really you're both saying oh it's a double decker isn't it a bus um so you see the top deck is the one on the top so i mean i don't know if you say it with boats generally i mean they have decks but you say below deck and on deck you don't really say top deck i know of anyway i've never been on a boat really so yeah maybe they do that associated with the top of a bus nothing else really maybe you had a double-decker boat yeah if you don't have many decks yeah well i guess you would say that so there we go but yeah i've been on the cruise ships there we go so what does it say on the back it says do milk chocolate with dream white chocolate there we go which we already knew so that's the official description but it's it's good enough it's a bit of beautiful description on the front and what we got here so so be treated wise enjoy a balanced diet it doesn't quite flare up anymore i don't think i never seen it but it's got the peel and we close something we've got going on here there's a very hot day today so i'm really holding this from the edges you can see with the flourish so the flourishes for once are actually coming in quite handy um so let's see so what we got so it's a bit um well it's all shades of purple here and stuff like that for some reason on the back it's quite difficult to for some reason they've done it but if you've just done they sell the nutrition information they've just done lots of different shades of purple i don't know why some of them are harder for me to read numbers i don't know why they've done that no they can't see any correlation i don't see why you'd do it anyway even if it was um there's a servings per packet 72 i think it says 7.2 is it 72 that means 72 squares serving size 25 grams approximately four squares it's like 72 yeah okay so it's quite a lot of uh well yeah all right so there we go so it's quite um there's quite a lot of squares then it seems yeah must be seven point two that would look like seventy two yeah it's seven point two it looks like seventy two that's pretty wacky but yeah so there we go 17 28 so it's about 28 yeah it's 28 it's probably about 30 squares basically i think is the gist of it and so i thought calorie wise so average quantity per serving blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so i'm trying to see here it's very difficult to sort of find just what's going on here yeah each serving contains well i think it's a bit funny in australia i don't know if they tell you in killer calories in calories i think they give it any killer jewels or something like that i can't quite tell yes i might i might do a caption i think for this one basically it's what servings are what whole bars and stuff like that 180 grams um bar anyway so it's quite heavy it's a big one and yeah and there we go you can see there that's the distribution place there there we go i live in manchester in the uk so i used to stop when i was younger and um marple's a place in stockholm there we go right yeah it looks very nice very nice presentation some there's some flourishes as you've seen helping me out in this case for once obviously you know what doesn't need flourishes really this one obviously does some people do say he just had does help someone put us in the comments said you just have to open him which is true but um sometimes they're excessively big and you know there's other ways to open them up you know there's all sorts of ways to open them i'm sure they're there specifically really just to make them look bigger than they are but obviously and it's happy it's unhappy serendipitous that we also have opening as well so so yeah it's 20 and a half centimeters long right well i should give it let's do it all right okay hopefully i'm centered fingers crossed sorry if i'm not um but yeah it's difficult for me to tell just give this a sniping then so he said um yeah i always measure it too soon really we said roughly you know 20 is it 20 about 25 centimeters no anyone it was when i measured it before yeah about 20 and a half okay maybe twenty six three points twenty point six okay let's give it an open then it's very hot in the uk today so a bit worried this might be a bit difficult to handle what's you know we'll do what we can it's not so hot outside but in my house it becomes very hot and that's the problem with the chocolate doesn't it doesn't enjoy it okay so i'm hoping this is a bit quite half and half really so i'm just going to measure it first before i uh so it's a 20 and a half hopefully yeah so let's measure this trusty ruler 17 centimeters now maybe just over now that's 17.1 maybe so we'll say it's 20.6 before because it did look a bit like that so yeah so lost basically three and a half centimeters yeah so quite you know not too bad considering there's two sides to it it definitely seemed worse than that this is a big bargain if you have seen one's very smaller bars you're losing more than that okay so let's try and handle this sentence to say i've got to be you can always see it's kind of looking a bit a bit damp so i don't know yeah i don't know why that is not sure why that is it's not melted but okay so i'm gonna i'm trying to figure out the best way to do it okay just go for it right so i told about look at that that looks beautiful it's very beautiful i just hold it there right way up yeah look at that that's very beautiful i think you would definitely say yeah it's very nice and it's a lovely one because it's also there's a whole the top deck is literally just the white chocolate so it's not like um it's only a very small amount on top i think we'll review one cadbury bar where they did sort of half and half well like a white chocolate on it and it was just it was barely any white chocolate it was a christmas tree one where it's shaped like christmas trees and basically the white hook is only a very small part of the actual vibe and it looks like it's more so there's actually more white chocolate in this one well it seems to me it's bled into it a bit you can see there's some some areas where it's bled into the dark into the milk chocolate i think on this side here you can see just about there it's done that in a few places so it's not perfect but i think you can let it off you can see where it's done i think that's fine yeah so you can see just in between the segments where it's done it's a bit melted a bit in hand so i'm just going to be careful so let's see we'll measure the height wise so four eight twelve sixteen twenty three which means there's thirty two segments in here it's about one point three centimeters i don't know why i said then four servings instead the seven point two servings when four segments is a thing so you got it means eight there's eight servings so don't quite i don't understand that at all um serving size this is two so 70 grams i can't read it no one 25 grams or something or 35 approximately four squares why is why i've not just done it where is it is a it is a it says it's a servings per package 7.2 why do not just know where serving is is is four squares and then there's eight servings you know it's just madness because it's melting on my hands now and to be careful what's crazy that isn't it's crazy yeah so try and uh yeah so what i'm going to do is i'm going to i'm just going to go wash my hands just because i can handle it but i don't want to damage the the white chocolate so i'm going to do that okay back in yeah say damage the white chocolate get sort of milk chocolate finger fingerprints on this or whatever okay so there we go so some of this bled there's one there is one segment yeah you can see as i say it's this one here it's got like a milk chocolate spot on it so i've not done that it was that when i opened it so a bit of a shame ruins the display a bit but there we go okay so let's uh get some squares off so you know did i do the height and stuff i'm sure i did the height did i just do it now quickly but one point one point three i think i did the height 1.3 and the width 8.5 there we go i'm quite sure i did the left until yeah we said we lost so many squares it's 17.1 wasn't it yeah okay so quickly stuff a bit off okay so there we go we've got a lovely lovely set i mean look at it it looks beautiful doesn't it really does look beautiful i have to say i'm very happy with it looks so nice yeah so put it off again so you can see there's some bleeding there's so you see in between there in between the two sevenths is a bit of bleeding but it's quite it's not it's only skin deep so yeah so let's uh where's my trusty knife it is just cut a segment down the middle so the actual uh white chocolate there just split off actually so you can see it's literally uh yes you can see it is all white chocolate or cadbury's dream i guess and this even lifts off so as if they kind of glue it on or something afterwards you know with wet chocolate or something it works it's very well designed yeah it's very nice and it's definitely full white chocolate there yeah it's really good really good yes i always say when i have to do was like cabbage mix buttons or whatever and review them or um we'll just have you know a milk chocolate button and then i know they do white chocolate as well i always say the best bits to put them together just have them one to the oven and eat them that way and it'd be perfect once you know and this is basically giving you that opportunity without any trouble um because it just comes like that so yeah it actually looks beautiful really happy with this it looks very nice very excited yeah let's give it a taste i think i can wait any longer let's do it right hello everyone welcome back so yes i'm going to say welcome back for me i've been around doing stuff obviously with you it's just in a brief second so yeah so look at that lovely yeah i'm going to try this lovely cavalry's top deck so it's the australian it's kind of australia because didn't do this in uk as far as i we have know do this only don't do it with cadbury's dream chocolate anyway doesn't have it over here anymore of course cubby's dream might be exactly the same as um coverage white in the uk you know who knows but um yeah don't know a lot of people who've had cabbage white here they don't like it as much as dreams so um you know but you know the australian one might be the same who knows i don't know and of course they don't might be different as well we don't know about that either so i need to review it perhaps okay i'm going to taste so i'm going to taste another couple of other segments so yeah i'll take one segment at a time there we go right it's quite soft chocolate because it's a bit warming so it's quite soft anyway that milk so obviously whiter well it could be dream um difference again doesn't do melting too much that but white chocolate doesn't tend to do that there we go so lovely segment can be written on it okay let's do it hmm definitely a prominent white chocolate and it's definitely i would say definitely does taste different than them than than cabbage white everyone i think has a bit of a chemically taste this seems to taste different to me um i'm gonna take the white chocolate off the top i can i thought it would come off quite easily because of the uh move on tape hmm i don't think straining one's the same as the uk one that used to be around in the past the cabbage dream but it definitely has a different taste and more um what's the word would you say vanilla maybe hmm there's definitely a different taste there is it buttery even not really buttery vanilla e possibly hmm the white chocolate is different than cabbage white i have to say hmm you know these them for memory serves and it just tastes nice i think it's definitely got to um yeah it's like i say it's like a sort of i don't know would you say vanilla i can't think of what the taste is hmm hmm it's hard to say sorry it tastes a bit sort of yeah hmm i don't know it's definitely like a i mean sweeter thing you'd say probably just sweeter it's got sweeter taste to it than them i think cabbage white definitely it's just sweeter i think it is i think that's the gist of it and it's nice it's a lovely white chocolate actually it's a nice dry chocolate yeah i'd have to be interested to do to do a proper review just stream on its own and the moon chocolate does this day milk whatever today we can i'll show you it's different than the uk one of course but hmm yeah it's quite soft today because it's hot as i say in my house but yeah i think it does taste today milk i think it's not i mean maybe slightly different i'm not sure it's hard for me to tell for certain but um um i'll say it's very it's close enough for you not to think any anything of it it's very nice he has a nice chocolate as well i really like the buff and i've only worked well together as well the white chocolate doesn't seem to be that sort of catchy in the photo white chocolate either which often does to me hmm it tastes quite fresh it tastes a bit hmm yeah i had an inkling then of what it tasted like but it tastes a bit like um yeah it's something it's not solidly white there's like a flavoring to it i think in the cabbage dream white chocolate it reminds me of when i've had a white chocolate that's um sort of been flavored a bit like say like a japanese kitkat or something where they use white chocolate as the base and then flavor it into another flavor and flavor to them whatever give it a flavor basically um and it tastes like that it has that sort of base that ground that's where that's where i feel like i've tasted it before so it's as if it's a white chocolate that's had an added taste to it and i think that's enough and i think that's what it is so i think they've added like a flavoring to the um to their to the white chocolate hmm i don't know what the flavoring is that's the confusing part hmm and it tastes that way to me anyway hmm that's what it reminds me of i'll say you might not have done that that's what it reminds me of it's very nice though yeah it's a lovely it's lovely bar have a way to eat them the fact you can separate them as well you can nibble the top off them quite easily lift off of your teeth you know it's stuck on but it lifts off pretty well hmm that's very nice it's a lovely um lovely white chocolate as i say does taste doesn't taste like it's pure white chocolate i must admit i don't know whether dream was like this in the past i can't remember it really now um but it's a nice taste all the same let's say it does taste a bit like you've said it's like a white chocolate that's been flavored somehow but in this case the flavoring isn't really to give it a flavor like toffee or something it's just a subtle taste i reckon to um to make it a bit more unique and that seems to be what's happened in my eyes anyway that's what it tastes like to me um yeah and it's nice and i think that's where i couldn't quite put my finger on it because it couldn't taste the best not flavor to taste like anything other than white chocolate really i guess but there's definitely something there no and i like it i like it's not vanilla it's not vanilla flavor either or if it is it's a very you know it doesn't taste distinctly vanilla-y so it's very hard to explain um but that's where i'm getting that's what i'm getting from it um but i like it and the milk chocolate is nice as well says it's very sort of um i don't think it's just it seems a bit more it seems to be quite a subtle day not taste but i could because it's a bit thinner obviously with the white chocolate on top of it as well affecting you it could be the australian one slightly different than the uk one or it could just be that you know it is what it is and i'm just um you know perhaps can't quite you know maybe i don't know i did have a bit on its own before and as i say it did taste of dairy milk but um but sometimes i think in the uk one it's a bit more stronger taste but as i say you normally have it in thickest chunks than this so that could be what we're explaining that really so it's probably something nothing as i'm saying i did i did get that donut taste and just not as strong so it probably is just due to the size of the chunks the amount in each chunk um but yeah now i really like it's a really nice really nice um um sort of chocolate bar it's a lovely it's a lovely novelty it works really well it's properly white and it's probably white and dark milk chocolate you know it's not one of those other let's say that christmas edition or whatever it is or winter edition cadbury's one they do in the uk where the christmas tree yeah it's christmas trees sort of segmented and chocolate in the christmas tree or pattern where the white but the ones that are you know milk and white chocolate christmas trees but the white ones are only half it's only the very top that's white chocolate so it's basically 70 milk chocolate it's nothing like that this is probably 50 if not more um cabbage dream or white chocolate yeah or cabbage dream um so it's really um yeah it's very it's really really they really have you know they've not cut corners it's what you'd want it's what you'd expect um and it's what you hope for and so yeah it's great so i think a five out of five for me it's really good i love the presentation i love the top deck name um everything about it the president it looks beautiful you know i mean there's only three quarters of it left now but it looks really nice doesn't it i really like it yeah no it's it's got it all right i think i would say i really like it yeah thought outside for sure okay guys let me know what you think as well um yeah if you've had this as well let me think what your memories are of cadbury stream as well um you know you know i know if you've had the australian one let me know what you think about that as well i might have to try and get a hold of one to get a review of it at some point so maybe do a comparison between that and uh cadbury's whites and also um milky bar as well because i think they're the three major

"hello youtubers this is Len Mooney and crime nuts me today we're going to be taste testing a European chocolate that is called Ritter sport dark chocolate with marzipan and we're gonna see how it tastes yeah cuz what the heck is marzipan yep and I've read about what it was on YouTube not YouTube Google on Google and it had something to do like it has sugar almonds on the almonds and egg whites in it that's what marzipan consists of and we've never tried marzipan so we're gonna see how it is but yeah the package on the back looks like this and there's the front and I know we open it kind of good job you already broken an eye I'm horrible with opening stuff harder harder alright but that's it harder okay move that of the wafer right now yeah chocolate so yeah grab yours grab yeah it looks like that on the inside so I'm going to take a little square piece like kind of like so like this you're gonna try it sloppy yeah it's really soft in the inside kind of reminds me like a marshmallow in the center it doesn't taste like a marshmallow but um its fluffy kind of reminds me of coconut the dark chocolates really nice mmm I'll say it's pretty interesting yeah it's a I don't know what I was expecting I think I was kind of expecting a little bit of something different but it's still really good the crunch is a little mm-hmm and yeah that's what like one of these looks like close up and the stuff inside out of a one out of 10 10 being the best for me personally I would rate this as a I guess seven seven out of ten what would you rate it cry about the same that's what I was thinking probably about a seven okay have any of you guys ever tried the Ritter sport chocolate bars or is there any other types of chocolates that you guys recommend now when it comes to chocolate

video review this time we have the milka happy cow yeah so i'd look at this one it's very nice um i like the you know the idea of it the design of it and uh yeah it's a very special looking one i like the concept it's just such a nice happy flavor yes you see it's basically a mix of milk alpine milk and white chocolate so um yeah i don't know why they call it happy cow specifically obviously they have a sort of logo or slogan or mascot of a cow there you can see clearly there there's alpine cow but um yeah i quite like the sun this one looks very nice yeah so it was typical milk or size um i read a lot of milk products and then which brings you all nicest i've done about 650 reviews now so in this corner you'll see um a link to a playlist of all my reviews so um yeah so once you've liked this one you subscribed and um and watched it and you can go and watch the rest of my videos as well and of course if you're in a position to do so i do have a patreon so please check out the different tiers on that and if you're in a position to do so please uh please back me there as well we really appreciate it truly would um but your presence here and just you watching is um wonderfully appreciated as well so thank you so much okay so answer the review um yeah so this one because you've seen some of the cadbury equivalents of this as well they've done like a sort of yeah basically a bit of a white chocolate medley and with their sort of products as well and then an interesting one so i'd look at this one i've got this one from home bargains in the uk and basically they're sort of the place to find milka products essentially um yeah so let's see it's a standard size bar 200 grams yeah what's the calories yeah so the whole bar 100 grams it's um 530 calories 27 grams of fat 18 of which etc and it's a 5 by 3 bar you know so it's segmented so and uh basically per which 20 grams for three segments and it's a per three segments basically 20 grams it's um 106 calories 5.8 grams of fats 3.5 of which etc so there we go yeah that's the fifth of the bar basically so one roux i guess yeah sometimes i'm sure they do six by four ones but this one's um a five by three so i don't know why that is but there we go it's a lovely color i like this purple color as well and in all the um it says hundred percent alpine milk at the bottom i think it's there anyway yeah and 100 alpine milk chocolate um yeah and all of them they've got like a sausage we've got a picture of the alps as well so you can see it's like a slightly different color as well normally a bit more obvious it's a different color but this one's like a darker purple than the rest of it and so usually if you stack them up you'd have different colors here for the different ones so the dye one for instance is red and you know et cetera it's quite a nice thing to do um yeah purple's my favorite colors this one's very much up my street so i like this lovely purple here in this one so i usually prefer this blue end of the purple spectrum so this is yeah definitely up my street yes very excited for this one um i'll say i like the name i think it's just all nice really and coco life is on the back as well um let's say this is the polish version of the bar but uh yeah mandalas paul scripts has a thing um yeah there we go yeah so very excited for this one i think um if we get into it let's give it open let's do it okay i'm also going to open this milk a happy cow so yes basically um a mix of their sort of alpine milk chocolate and their their white chocolate i don't think he said white chocolates alpine milk chocolate as well i'm not sure but it did well it did say it's on their white version so i don't yeah it's not milk chocolate so i don't quite understand what it means by that i don't know if it just means there's alpine milk used in it but yeah either way i'll just measure the flourishes so i think um i should know these off by heart now but i forgot unfortunately eight and a half i was going to say that as well typical just got a little bit we can open it here it gives you a little pointers how to do it where is it there it feels a bit soft in my hands this bar actually as i'm holding it i feel like it's caving in a bit so it's not a warm day in the uk really relatively so we're let's give it an opening so it was 89 centimeters i think this is mainly milk chocolate um i don't know if i gave the description did i before when i looked at it so yeah it's now 15 and a half so it was 18 and a half yeah so it's three centimeters really so yeah about fifth there which is within my tolerance what did it say the actual description was um alpine milk chocolate 85 with white chocolate 15 so there we go there's not much white chocolate in there okay yeah you can tell from the look of it but i think that looks really nice actually look at that it's just like a pattern on the cow where you'd say relatively um well you know stylized one of course but yeah i think that's nice might be way around really more white than them brown on the actual cow butter yeah i think that's really nice mmm you see the mocha logo as well yeah the cadburys do do an equivalent of this one as well so it's clearly just i don't know the same ingredients or the same process just put in a cadbury mold i think because they are owned by mandalas and both of their chocolates have been presumably made in the same place now i don't think they're made in bourneville in the uk like they used to be so let's say yes so the the width 15 and a half or the height rather than the width is seven and a half and that's a typical milker size i think this one about um about point eight centimeters point seven five point eight centimeters high from the lowest points highest points and then the lowest points of the in between the segments is 0.6 millimeters just about something that's really nice i really like the look of that so shame is not more white chocolate involved it's mainly as it's 85 milk chocolate but uh still is quite nice let's give it a bit of a snappage gonna ruin it unfortunately so yeah you can see there it's it's really just the top there's white chocolate you know it doesn't go that far down at all yeah the pattern is pretty good but you can see here the way it's bled in a bit in these little bits there so you can see which is a bit of a shame but um i think it still look great i didn't notice it too dramatically yeah it's very nice but so mia has to say a shame let's say the the white chocolate doesn't really go down that far you can see it's really just only on the top really yeah i think if i just try and cut one a segment yes it's really just that bit at the top so you can see it does go that far down it's not just literally on the top but it doesn't go into this part of the chocolate here so as if they've added it on top of a bar of chocolate they've added the top part or something like that there we go yeah so that's why there's only 15 percent white chocolate yes it measures about two and a half millimeters this whole thing is about 8.7 centimeters seven millimeters all right well i'm very excited about so it looks very nice as i say hopefully it'll taste good so yeah i think we should get into it let's give it a taste okay i want to give this milk a happy cow taste a mix of well 85 milk milk and milk chocolate and 15 milk of white chocolate so yeah all right let's give it a go then so i'll give give this segment a guess mini cut off i did let's give it a taste let's do it what does it expect you've mainly tasted the milk alpine milk chocolate and it tastes nice actually you're going to get some segments like this one hardly have any white chocolate it doesn't go it's not below the surface ever you know what i mean it's only ever at the top so you can see snap that segment in half yes it's not like his white chocolate hidden in the middle either so this is mainly just milk chocolate which is the problem with the bar i think but um you know yeah suppose what you think it's not it's not as much white chocolate as milk chocolate basically but uh which is nice i think even in the sections though where you do get lots of white chocolate seemingly half and half you're not really because in the middle as i say it is uh mainly milk chocolate so you see you're not easily tasting the white chocolate it's more about the appearance this one i think they're really having a white chocolate experience i'm sure you had them regular milk and this one side by side you could taste the difference but hmm i think having it just on its own it's hard to taste the white chocolate really um makes you feel it's a bit more of a gimmick rather than there you know i don't know um it is nice though as i say but you're mainly just having sort of milker milk chocolate really because the um white chocolate sort of distributed over various layers and things it's not really easy to taste you might think because it's always 15 or whatever you know but um as i say it's not equally distributed um so swings around i don't know what to say really i'm not sure i think it's disappointing that you don't get much of a white chocolate taste as it was a case in the cadbury's equivalence of these but in the cadbury when they did one they did distribute their white chocolate very evenly over it did it with the christmas tree one i think there's lots of pine trees and the segments were kind of christmas tree segments and then on the top of some of them like you know i don't think half but well maybe half of them were white chocolate topped ones where basically the segments were christmas tree shaped and some of them you know in the same way that these have white chocolate and we're top with white chocolate but it's evenly distributed so you could kind of perhaps i don't know get more of a distinct feel for the white chocolate button you don't really get that in this one i don't think um even in the cubby one it was very much um milk chocolate affair you know hmm i think it's nice overall but it is really just mmm as i say out of these of the the milk alpine milk chocolate you don't really need much getting much of a white chocolate taste it's mainly just the appearance really which is a nice one um you know i'm sure there's a slight taste there and obviously as i say if you've had them side by side but regular alpine milk couldn't they in this one you could probably think oh yeah it is a slight taste of white chocolate but it's really hard to detect i mean when you're just having it like this it's a bit where you think well probably may as well not be there really hmm well you know it's still nice so it's hard to know what to say really because obviously i think it fails in the insofar as giving you a white chocolate sensation but as i say i think it's more about the appearance and the concept that happy cow it's a nice name it looks nice the pattern did look like it they've got another of a cow you know it doesn't say some of it had blood you can see these of lines of white chocolate here and things and then when i opened when i had the pa the sort of packing very open it felt like my i was doing indenting so it felt soft like i was breaking it by pushing into it but um and squishing it but that's not happened so overall i do like it you know um it just seems disappointing the white chocolate's just not prominent enough it'd be nice if there was more white chocolate something and that would i think i would make it better and i think that's what you're expecting you're probably expecting really a 50 50 split if you look at the front there you've got like this roll of white chocolate and this roll of just curl or whatever you have milk chocolate you know and looking at that you might be thinking oh yes 50 50 really and i think that's what what you'd expect and i think that's what would make it more interesting but the fact is 85 15 that's a massive you know it's not even like two-thirds one-third um you know it's yeah it's it's there's hardly any white chocolate in it and you hardly taste it result so i think for that that's despite how it tastes pretty nice actually it's only because it just tastes really of the regular milk or alpine milk chocolate um so i think i've got to kind of mark it down for that really i think you i think you are expecting a 50 50 split even though on there you could argue there isn't clearly in this segment there isn't a 50 50 split but i think you probably would want that or expecting at least more than 85 15. so i think i've got to mark it down for that i think i think i think you you'd probably be disappointed if it was a quarter you know um you know 75 75-25 um so i would say it should really be two-thirds mil chocolate i think 50-50 might be a bit much maybe um but i still think you know i think that's probably what you'd expect but i think i think you know 60 40 probably would be yeah an acceptable amount um well 65 35 i'm just kind of keep going changing the numbers but either way i think you get the point i think that would be more exciting where it should be really where the white chocolate is at least detectable i think that's just what i'm trying to say and that isn't and isn't the case with these um these ratios here so if i'm going to say three enough out of five i think i think it would definitely be more if it was what you'd expected and you could taste the white chocolate it's more prominent um but that's it you can't and it really may as well just be the regular um milk or alpine milk chocolate bar you know with no white chocolate at all i think is the gist of it so that's why i'm giving it free half out of five but yeah i know you think if you've had this one if you've been disappointed by if you thought it should be more white chocolate am i certainly expecting more definitely more than fifteen percent as i say um it's a real shame i think and i missed missed opportunity really i don't know why they've done that very strange yeah but it's a nice looking bar as i say and the branding is good i like the name of it happy cow um but just a shame yeah the white chocolate is pretty much really lacking i would say so yeah three and a half out of five okay i hope you enjoyed that review and leave a comment for free it's always good to see it for me

coffee and the cream chocolate bar the net weight on this thing is 200 grams and let's have a look on the back here this is a Germany product we can see that the calories are 190 calories and serving size is 5 squares which is 33 grams for those people that are watching their diet I'm going to read the ingredients here real quick I'm gonna flip it over it contains milk chocolate which is sugar cocoa butter dry cream chocolate chocolate liqueur dry whole milk nonfat dry milk lactose so listen and natural vanilla flavor also contains white chocolate which is made from sugar cocoa butter dried whole milk dry cream nonfat dry milk lactose dry buttermilk soil ishutin salt natural vanilla flavor who knew all that would would take to make white chocolate anything interesting also contains less than 2% off coffee for the coffee flavor contains milk and soy may contain hazelnuts almonds peanuts and other tree nuts in case you may be allergic to this type of stuff ok and of course it's gluten free for people that you know have gluten issues so let me see how can I open this up ok there's a Tabler I'm gonna pull on this eye like so and I'm going to yank it it looks like it's a foil type of wrapper inside so I'm gonna pull this out I'm gonna pull this whole thing out so it's easier to view I like a saw let's say what this be here yes let's do that and I'm going to unwrap it and all boy doesn't that look awesome that looks amazing I'm using this is actually one of my favorite chocolate when it comes to even with coffee amazing okay I'm bill advice when it comes to this I'm gonna break it off and we're just gonna take a bar the whole bar out whole five pieces out I'm gonna set this aside here so it's not in the way and looks just like the picture doesn't it okay I'm gonna break one piece off you can see that it's milk chocolate on top and or white chocolate on top and milk chocolate on the bottom so it's coffee flavor Chocolat okay I'm gonna put one piece in my mouth mmm-hmm before you even bite into it you can smell or taste the coffee flavor hmm I'm grabbing a knife here real quick and hmm it melts in your mouth but it melts pretty slowly which is great with coffee when you when you take this with coffee oh man instead of putting sugar in your coffee just get this this is what it looks like when it's cut in half the white chocolate and milk chocolate melt at the same time in your mouth which is great and melt slower which I like so when you're sipping a coffee your mouth is like coated with this stuff so that way you just have a really good after taste and flavor in your mouth while you're drinking coffee on top of this or black tea if you're into that it does melt in your hands a little bit here but I really like this this chocolate I always have so I'm a bit biased but if you're if you like you know white chocolate with combination of milk chocolate and coffee flavor inside you will like it so that being said there is a link in the description if you're interested thank you so much for watching don't forget to subscribe I will have a lot more videos have a good day bye bye", "LEbDNtJhoIU": "so today's video is going to be a twofer two for one that is so before your eyes is belonging chocolate from ikea so we've got with lingonberries here um with wild blueberries here so they're both milk chocolate let's see what they're both like so let's start with blueberries so if you need to know what's found within i'll probably just show you them both so that's why it is in english at the top and that's what's in the lingerie one got it excellent so let's crack them open by crack me and do this really slowly whilst everything just nothing happens so yeah let me know in the comments below how many what kind how was your preferred product food wise from ikea obviously you may eat furniture and i'm not going to comment and if that's how your you feel about those kind of things but you may prefer like the meatballs or maybe you want dime or any of those things what's your favorite thing from ikea in terms of food outside the restaurant so blueberries on this side the ring berries on this side yeah i should probably really do this off camera but hey we don't do things off camera here do we no no we don't do that except when we do so let's grab a bit of the chocolate so this is what it looks like you can see the berries inside there's partially there's a few in there you definitely smell a hint of something hmm let's nibble yep you get the blueberries somehow they're blueberries with suffering this has edged its way into the chocolate it's not super strong flavor but it's prominent and it's there okay that one's good let's guess this one's gonna be good as well because we've gotta crack a little bit off and then crack another bit off so revealing the lingenberry chocolate not pulling out the whole bar just want to wee bit because pretty much it looks like this and the other one looks like guess what that so this is the lingenberry one yep they're in there they're a bit more prominent in this bar than they are in the blueberry at least in that piece so hold on panic cleanse nibble time didn't get the initial hit of berry flavor like i could taste through with the blueberry hmm maybe the lingeries aren't quite as at least in that bit robustly breaking through well they're definitely prominent not prominent they're definitely there yeah between the two the berry flavor at least on this initial tasting this one has a much more prominent berry flavor than this one i'm not saying it's not there but this was more up front than this however both are really good bars of chocolate because pretty much most of these are really good bars of chocolate and i've recently found that there's going to be a blueberry based cadbury bar so maybe maybe they're quite similar maybe which one will be better that's an interesting question so anybody will have managed to have both this and the cadburys by the time this comes out or afterwards so yeah comment below ikea foodie things would you like also like share and subscribe all of that dooblydoos and i shall see you after honestly i won't be eating all this chocolate just so you know i'm not eating all the chocolate i need some of the chocolate not all of the chocolate see you later", "uwdJ5bSAYoc": "hi today's review is for Karl fazer

in here so half a bar is 500 calories see so that's all the information that we have here so let me open it and take a look okay so it's definitely dark chocolate so a half is 16 squares so 16 squares is 500 calories so eight squares this 250 calories for squares 125 calories two squares is 62.5 so this is 30 1.25 per square I think okay I broke it in half it just and you can take a look see little chunks of orange in here so break off a square there you can also see the back the back is interesting it's got lots of texture on the back nope doesn't seem to break off cleanly so okay let me try this and let me know what you know what I think okay i love these one of my favorite things ever is dark chocolate covered candied orange peels and i didn't know what to make of these orange crisps that were in here but whatever they've done to create these orange crisps they aren't candied orange peels but whatever they've done to create these things they are really potent in terms of their chocolate flavor so you get a real explosion of chocolate fillet of orange flavor and then it feels like the chocolates just enrolled over it it's very very good that the chocolate is smooth on top of it a wonderful flavor I can't say enough and enjoyed this one a lot so this is Carl fav phasers orange and crisps made in finland if you like these reviews please select subscribe on this channel and if you have any suggestions for ones you'd like to see a review for please put that in the comments and thank you very much for watching bye", "N9RJBaowHH4": "alright this chocolate bars killing me I have to try this now so I want to turn the camera on and give this a go this is the Milka bar that was sent to me from Austria it's put out by Kraft Foods so someone mentioned they saw at Walmart in you know in the States I don't shop for candy and Walmart I mean I don't really shop for candy anymore period when I got some different chocolates to try I got a net like my grocery store but who knows then Walmart that's awesome anyway I would assume there's different types of mocha bars milk is probably the brand this one is ALP en mi l CH I'm gonna boat trip and I'm gonna make a guess anyway al pijn milk mooch I don't know but it sounds good so here we go get a Boston to it give it a try say I think this little piece of it right here milk chocolate color down the hatch hmm okay well that is it's best chocolate around my life it is ridiculously tasty Wow all right well I thought that um that alpine milk chocolate stuff was good it doesn't even hold the can list this is um it's really really good it's extremely extremely creamy and rich it's very sweet obviously tastes like good milk chocolate but there's definitely something else going on there it almost tastes like a coconut flavor in there not as strong coconut flavor but it's subtle that's what I pick up on it I know it's not flavored anything it's just no chocolate but if you guys ever get a chance to get this stuff you have to get a bar it is really really good it's actually it's close to the chocolate the milk chocolate that Cadbury uses you know for their Cadbury eggs it kind of has that thing going on but like even better even a deeper flavor it's really really really good I want to melt this and pour over a good rich cold vanilla ice cream but we have another ice cream I mean a nice to come in like a year and a half but wow it's just so good oh my god Wow yeah I can easily say this is my my favorite chocolate I've ever had my life it is it was really worth it it's like if you like Hershey's bars you just like regular milk chocolate Hershey's that would be there to be an analogy Hershey's milk chocolate is to ground beef or let's say Hershey's milk chocolate is to burger on the grill whereas milk up milk chocolate is to a perfectly cooked beef wellington you know they're both chocolate they're both meat it's not really a good example but I think you get what I'm saying with that they both are chocolate but it's so much more like a just a more sophisticated flavor it's not just like just chocolate nothing more chocolate I love chocolate my favorite thing in the world to do is eat chocolate while watching really walk in the chalk affector ii particularly when they're talking about the chocolate River that is uh it's pretty cool actually you know what I would tell you a story time video because we're watching you my friend Chris it's a really Wonka story so yeah we don't thought about this video I'll make another story time video because it's pretty good one it's a has to do with chocolate so keep the stay tuned for that but yeah this is just I mean if I had three hands to be three thumbs up there's nothing wrong this it's delicious creamy rich very sweet not like candy sweet but just you know just sweet enough it's really the perfect chocolate I've never had anything that's better so um did I admit to you that soon as I shut the camera off underneath the rest of the bar right now to the second so let me go enjoy this in peace thank you very much the person sent this it's uh it's amazing stuff so that's all if you see this stuff and you like chocolate you missing out if you don't buy it I promise you that's it hope you guys enjoy the rest of your day take it easy", "_fgZ5ckp7OA": "[Music]  goddamn tripod yeah still crooked awesome so this is dick

fact in front of us very exciting it is silky smooth it is from the Mars company I have attempted to review the dove bar before and then I ran into some problems with the I don't know what I ran into some problems with the system with my what do you call it camera so this is take two but that was about a year ago that I tried to do that review so here I am now with what I'm gonna consider the the real final review although that said I have reviewed a couple of other dub products or something similar because Mars makes dove and dove is kind of like their core brand like if well if milky way's Mars is core candy bar dove is their core straight chocolate bar although most places or a lot of places will know this as the galaxy right so dove and galaxy are actually the same products they're made by both made by Mars they're both kind of core bars although the difference is that they do come in different SKUs dove comes in milk as well as a dark mm-hmm look at a review of that and some time soon almond cookies and cream and one more which is escaping me mint whereas galaxy comes in things like a caramel which I've reviewed fruit and nut i reviewed as well both of which i liked it it has nothing to do with of the toiletries from Unilever it's maybe a little melty hopefully not too bad they're trying to get into it quick before it gets all melty melty melty dove okay sorry for the noise guys blue nosing around here today but duh yeah it's a good looking good smelling core Mars and chocolate you know at hittin stuff like simple basic but like solid Mars chocolate at its finest came around in the in 1956 from a Chicago company and in 1986 it was bought out by Mars the galaxy launched in the UK in the 1960s in 1960s so I'm not a hundred sure Galaxy was its own brand or was or was initially part of the Dove company or if it was a Mars product and then when Mars bought of they unified the brands I'm not 100% sure but I do know they now dove and galaxies are the same products essentially but the chocolate is just great just really really solid milk chocolate mmm man you guys are not gonna go wrong DUP comes in also large sized bars which is great I like the fact it comes in small sized bars it's not always the easiest for me to find I find I feel but um when you do get it you're not gonna go wrong they also have a lot of other like ancillary products I got a pack of Dove chocolate covered blueberries that look fantastic I might review those as well in the near future Doug it's a good bar and I got a recommend it I really like Mars chocolate if you've seen any of my other reviews you'll know that I am a big fan of Mars products in general what was I seen in the UK galaxy was rated the core galaxy bar was rated the second best chocolate bar after the dairy milk so people seem to like it and there's a good reason it's really sweet it's really smooth that's really solid milk chocolate guys walking candy I was gonna rape the dove milk chocolate bar a 5 out of 5 for you know mass-produced non you know artisanal chocolate you're not gonna go wrong with the dove bar it's really good so I definitely recommend it guys thank you very much for watching um you guys

to the her shoes white chocolate milk oh my god guys this is really good and Kasich up like if you put a peop um a milk shake from mcdonalds or whatever and you put mixed together chocolate and vanilla milkshake and mix them together and put it into one cup that's what that tastes like it is really good I get the chocolate and it's like a creamier so it's really good so you guys do this in

"vxpH99zd48s": "amiable okay so I went to a karate party a few weeks ago and we gift exchange and I got a box of lint Randle endure chocolate truffles there were six different times color-coded for my convenience three of each kind in the box so 18 of these little chocolate balls and that's one of the color codes go well read here is milk chocolate pretty standard kind of like a Hershey's bar this is not dark chocolate milk chocolate very diluted half strength very creamy I did enjoy that nothing special but I thought it was here blue is dark chocolate complete with all the cocoa and sugar rush very intense very rich and black is supposed to be the extra dark chocolate which is like a blue ball and a half super intense blue was the sea salt chocolate which is a kind of a new taste it's like a more diluted milk chocolate with a little bit of Tang enos to it I like it it's my favorite I really kind of lot more does almost really good orange was the caramel chocolate which wasn't bad I like your standard Twix bar honestly but I like cooks bars and I like the addition of caramel the chocolate so that's okay I did enjoy this and this yellow one here is white chocolate which was disgusting it's not even real chocolate it's like wanna be a vanilla that has that nasty expired tang to it it tastes almost like vanilla for the first few seconds and then it just gets disgusting after that like almost like you're drinking some expired milk I honestly only ate this one because it was part of the pack otherwise I would not have screwed with it but yeah don't go for this one and that's my review of the Lindt brand Lindner chocolate truffle box I think I might want to get a couple more sea salts maybe got more caramels if I can find it individually but that's what I think anyway",

excellent time at lavaloja chocolate factory if you're ever on the big island this is a place that you need to go to not only do you get to sample all the chocolate you get to learn how it's made and you get to taste an actual cacao [Music] fruit [Music] we're going to take some chocolate if there's one thing on this planet that laura loves more than anything it's some chocolate so today we're gonna go see how chocolate is made here on the island at a private tour i'm so excited [Music] we had to make a call to get into here we sure are yes we have an appointment for 2pm thank you we are doing a chocolate tour basically to see how chocolate is made here on the island like mike said and this place is called lava loja oh this really is pretty far back there we're turning to the right lava loja chocolate farm tours it's a chocolate farm you guys this is great oh look at the view this is great oh so what is what is the premise of this tour what are we doing here let's check out some of our uh cacao trees we're gonna start off with our younger fields and then go into our more mature orchards [Music] [Music] here they have these trees wrapped because they're just young and pigs and beetles will get to it so they're covered up for now keeping them safe until they're about two or three years old before they'll grow up and sprout right out of there and they won't need the bag anymore [Music] everything that we've just passed all the way back here is all run by only four employees or farmers if you will what an awesome place what an awesome job way at the back here are the trees that are about 10 to 12 years old and fully matured [Music] so what we're looking for is like a bright pumpkin color okay oh there it is that's right right there wow there's the pumpkin color this one's gonna be good i can tell so it's a thick husk so the scratch test does not harm them whatsoever okay this is so stupid of me but no no questions okay i imagined that like the inside would look like chocolate it might trick ya oh my gosh that is hot right now okay okay and uh you can suck on the nectar around it and i think it might surprise you slippery little suckers so don't see the bean itself but the cumin or the pulp is around it the rum is full of sugar citric acids and oils and it helps it kind of tastes like cooking process oh my god it's really good i think you're supposed to eat the middle you keep the middle it's a bit bitter if you like dark chocolate you can mix the whole thing together and if you feel like having another seed you can bite through it look at it and you'll notice the color change slime don't worry about spitting seeds anywhere yeah yeah i kind of want a little more this is for you got a little jewel box and everything thank you what that's so awesome so after being able to taste the inside the raw fruit of cacao it's the most crazy flavor it tastes like the starburst of fruits the whole fruit on the outside of the seed is white and it tastes kind of like a starburst it really is like the sweetest fruit crazy delicious it's delicious it's my new favorite food staying ahead of the curve is a big deal especially here there are about 12 other cacao farms on hawaii but this one specifically the lavaloja has been around the longest so they're really developing these plants to be some of the best on the island [Music] we would use these rather prehistoric instruments yeah it's really difficult to smash a pod open with this thing it'll just exhaust you later on we kind of uh modified a machete to be more of a guillotine and this we still use but we needed to invest in one of these guys well and all the way here from brazil and is the envy of all of the cacao [Music] growers [Music] rather than your yard that smells like so when again this stuff gets wet it'll smell even more like chocolate ho lee moly that smells like that smells great yeah you said this fertilizer why is that fertilizer that's crazy we don't want anything that's the best smelling fertilizer i've ever smelled and i want to buy that for everything last but not least we're visiting the chocolate lounge it okay that so with extreme pressure and a little bit of heat this is how we extract our cocoa butter so we're done teasing you this is the tempered version and this is our absolute dark this is the 90 this is not the regular 90 that you would try on the ordinary smooth aftertaste you don't get that accurate burn it's like coating them the flavors that are coming through on this are incredible oh great these are 70 [Music] i'm actually tasting the fruity notes that you're saying did you get that banana right away yeah totally whoa yeah she's not getting that banana not [Music] although i liked both of the other ones too but that one was like yeah that makes you like here we are back at the visitor center we're going to try some of their white chocolates with with powders in it so it's like she said it was like a cookie and cream experience [Music] oh my gosh i guess i have to whoa not good no joke white chocolate these are my favorite but that doesn't taste like a it's like wow it's like milk chocolate yeah it's all chocolate if you're ever on the big island this is a place that you need to go to not only do you get to sample all the chocolate you get to learn how it's made and you get to try the beans and the beans just like we showed you they are wrapped in like a flesh and it's so sweet and delicious those people are awesome huge thank you to melissa justine and jeremy they were awesome hosts and they were excellent tour guides so today we're gonna go see how chocolate is made here on the island at a private tour that we just bought i'm so excited yeah you get to try the seeds not seeds what are they beans beans beans beans you get to try the beans all right it's that way we're going the wrong way it's getting a little bumpy in here it's okay you can take it stop you're doing that on purpose oh my gosh that's disgusting orchards of some type right no yuck ew spirit get it get fit a lot of times we see like this rat squirrel weasel thing crosstalk oh mangoes what mongoose yay we're walking through the woods pollinated by bees they are pollinated by midges which is a little grass fly and they jump up not little people yeah not little i thought that first when you had the bridges not the other ones with 12 other kakawa uh cacao there are about 12 other cacao farms on we're heading towards the processing bay okay this is the milk truck this is so we are no longer in vegan territory wait what makes it what milk powder no milk yeah none of the dark chocolate has any milk it's such a tummy what makes you cheery here we are back at the visitor center with a new battery finally and we're gonna try [Music] you", "fd1idUDq1HQ": "hello and welcome to sweet talk with Kay today I'm taking a look at the Kit Kat white bar I didn't even know they made a Kit Kat with white chocolate its crispy wafers and cream so it looks like instead of from the picture on the front looks like just instead of the milk chocolate they are using white chocolate so let's open it up and take a look so if I looks just like a KitKat bar and white chocolate so you have to break it it's the rule with a KitKat and yeah it looks just like a regular a regular chocolate cake campfire with white chocolate so let's try it out that's good um I like it it's very um it's really something similar to a regular KitKat I guess obviously and I was um pardon me I was a little skeptical of white chocolate a lot of times with the less expensive candy bars when they use white chocolate it has a chemical taste to it this really doesn't it almost just tastes like the milk chocolate um it has a very that has a very distinctive KitKat chocolate Kit taste it kind of carries that distinctive taste over but it's a white chocolate which is a little bit lighter but it's good it's not chemically so if you like white chocolate and you like a KitKat I think you would like this it's um it's good it's good it just tastes like a KitKat with some white chocolate on it so um two thumbs up that was a good one and I thank you so much for watching and I hope you have a sweet day", "GQ9cH9IStrI": "A chocolate bar is a chocolate\nconfection in bar form, which distinguishes it from bulk chocolate\nproduced for commercial use or individually portioned chocolates such\nas pastilles, bon-bons, and truffles. In most of the English-speaking world,\nchocolate bar also refers to a typically snack-sized bar coated with or\nsubstantially consisting of chocolate but containing other ingredients.\nA chocolate bar made exclusively from chocolate contains some or all of the\nfollowing components: cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and milk. The\nrelative presence or absence of these define the subclasses of chocolate bar\nmade of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate. In addition to\nthese main ingredients a chocolate bar may contain flavorings such as vanilla\nand emulsifiers such as soy lecithin to alter its consistency.\n\"Chocolate bars\" containing other ingredients feature a wide variety of\nlayerings or mixtures that include nuts, fruit, caramel, nougat, and fondant. A\npopular example is a Snickers bar, which consists of a nougat mixed with caramel\nand peanuts. Chocolate bars are often loosely called\ncandy bars in American English, a term that encompasses similar treats produced\nwithout chocolate, such as the Zagnut and Bit-o-Honey bars.\nA wide selection of similar chocolate treats are produced with added sources\nof protein and vitamins. These include forms of energy bar and granola bar and\nare sold as snacks and nutritional supplements.\nHistory  Up to and including the 19th century,\nconfectionery of all sorts was typically sold in small pieces to be bagged and\nbought by weight. The introduction of chocolate as something that could be\neaten as is, rather than used to make beverages or desserts, resulted in the\nearliest bar forms, or tablets. At some point, chocolates came to mean any\nchocolate-covered sweets, whether nuts, creams, caramel candies, or others. The\nchocolate bar evolved from all of these in the late-19th century as a way of\npackaging and selling candy more conveniently for both buyer and seller;\nhowever, the buyer had to pay for the packaging. It was considerably cheaper\nto buy candy loose, or in bulk. In 1847, Joseph Fry found a way to mix\nthe ingredients of cocoa powder, sugar and cocoa to manufacture a paste that\ncould then be molded into a chocolate bar proper for consumption.\nSubsequently, his chocolate factory known as the Fry's chocolate factory,\nlocated in Bristol, England, began mass-producing them and they were very\npopular. The firm began producing the Fry's Chocolate Cream bar in 1866. Over\n220 products were introduced in the following decades, including production\nof the first chocolate Easter egg in UK in 1873 and the Fry's Turkish Delight in\n1914. In 1896, the firm became a registered private company and was run\nby the Fry family, with Joseph Storrs Fry II, grandson of the first Joseph\nStorrs Fry, as Chairman. Although chocolate bars had their\nbeginnings in the 19th century, their sales grew most rapidly in the\nearly-20th century. In North America, Ganong Bros., Ltd. of St. Stephen, New\nBrunswick, developed and began selling their version of the modern chocolate\nbar in Canada by 1910. The Hershey Chocolate Company took the lead in the\nU.S. The world's largest \"chocolate bar\" was\nproduced as a stunt by Thorntons plc on 7 October 2011. It weighed 5,792.50 kg\nand measured 4m by 4m by 0.35m.

have a piece of chocolate here and it's my chocolates I like white chocolate good structure mom and there's a rather full taste I like this chocolate usually table vona we see it in the milk chocolate version it has a very cheap story the action it's called and they have this white table homeless so every now and then when I visit the action sometimes take this and then these particles particles compartments are just the right size but I always stick two or three anyway it's a very distinctive form for a chocolate bar looks like a mother I think I really think I'd taste the honey have these when you when you eat it you have these pieces in your mouth so you taste a white chocolate but you also you these little pieces I think you can see them here these are slightly harder that's the almond I think and now it's quite time for our hero well a hundred grams is a hundred grams month I'm going to take one more piece I see for the first time that our letters here oh and the N I see I didn't know that [Music] not going to put it back now it's a very good packaging usually chocolate bars are you know they have just the sheet of paper around them but this is just cardboard so it's a

bars these are chocolate bars they were $5.99 each at the Fresh Market I have white chocolate raspberry popping candy and I have the 32 percent milk chocolate hazelnut so - it's just 28% white chocolate so it's a huge bar I agree - yes so yes it is $5.99 however it is myself to see how it's cut you can see the difference in there it says there are six servings in the bar so you have to weigh em because it's good stuff yes the way they're cut that's the only that's the only negative thing it's neat that they're just kind of like sporadic the way they're cut but then again if you are trying to divide it up evenly it's almost impossible so 1/6 of the bar 30 grams is 160 calories it says hi there we're cha tony's chuckle only we exist to end modern slavery and illegal child labor in the chocolate industry our mention is 100% flava free chocolate not just our chocolate that's all chocolate worldwide the more people join us and share our story the sooner 100% slavery chocolate becomes the norm the choice is yours are you in it is made in Belgium and it's distributed out of Portland Oregon but made in Belgium so it's www.oneonone.org does our children oh yeah Wow and so this is the Belgian Fairtrade white chocolate with freeze-dried raspberries and popping candy ooh either at all a little bit of popping candy in there not much nobody kept the house I think it's the white chocolate it could be with the raspberries the raspberries to use my raspberries I don't really think takes very good no we've had free strawberries another thing you know what I just think it's about I think the raspberries are very incredibly tart and even a bitter yeah they're on the bitter side mmm yeah and they're very very strong no and and the chocolate is not a very sweet chocolaty right so it doesn't help that once it right do your left for this is like a bitter cup the white chocolate does not taste like a typical American white chocolate because it is lacking the sweetness and the popping candy and they it doesn't have as much popping candy yeah probably that's like a Cadbury though that's popping candy this doesn't have it has some but not near as much I just I do not care for sorry no I would do it and I do think it's it's primarily because those freeze-dried right there yeah tastes like yeah so this one is the milk chocolate with hazelnuts and it is one sixth of our 30 grams is a headset so 160 for the white chocolate raspberry 170 for the milk chocolate hazelnut gonna find a good piece of breakers for 32 percent milk chocolate yeah that's what I'm saying it's neat to have the shape but then again river yeah it's not because there's no way to divide about mm-hmm yeah you can see the hazelnuts sticking out all of them are so bad chocolates good the the issue isn't with the amount that they give you because just like with this raspberry one it's long it is absolutely full of raspberries they're sticking out the hazelnut no they put plenty of hazelnuts in there but they're yellow so it was it's not how much they give you plenty of those raspberries yes if they were freeze-dried ice cream these I agree with you completely and I like the hazelnut a lot better oh yeah and still it's a very it's mainly a milk chocolate bar no you do you do taste hazelnut but not like it's not strong no I mean it's just you get the size of that mousse else that's what's giving it to flavor you're right and the chocolate from yous just okay it's not like we've had much better milk chocolates good that way this looks good but it's not as good as some of the other right so if you're looking for something different like a funky looking bar you know something different a special gift to give somebody I think these are good I would definitely choose the milk chocolate over the white I would just would not recommend that one at all unless you've had freeze dried raspberries and you like those because like I said Kevin and I have reviewed things what's free seurat of raspberries in the past and it's never gone well but it's not something we would ever choose to eat we made sure there have the fresh raspberries so honestly both of these would be a pious for me we've had other ones that we liked a lot more yeah yeah what Mike said the head looks good it's just not great because they have some absolutely delicious bars out there these just weren't

bar and what chocolate 12 Wow you've been on one isn't it seems to fade in noodle there so it kind of looks a bit like it's been you know in the Sun or something so it looks like I can't quite you know yeah this looks like it's going bad reflection but it's just elated looking back on in the camera REM yeah can't quite read it well anyway Bailey's original Irish cream it says in the form of 12 sauce very nice doesn't it yeah I think you would say I'm not much of an alcohol person I don't drink too much I'm sort of like things like babies and stuff I can manage to wear a glass or two of them so yeah so Justin see how this is that I mean oh yeah I dare say it's probably doesn't really have Bailey's babies I mean you're gonna drunk off it but Tim you know they would go probably flavored or whatever really - you in there it says on the back here bear least original Irish Cream Liqueur milk chocolate roll bar so ingredients baklava bar does it actually have Bailey's in there mmm I just say babies yeah it does I Bailey's in there six percent so that's the year alkoxides each other I said this contents in there but anyway that's quite nice you can split seat bears got the nice base packaging probably saw the baby's logo yeah I think it is it was quite nice yeah well he's random bars you get really I mean I think I'm starting home bargains they sell them all the time at home bargains but you know there's biggest supermarket seems to pay around Christmas time don't it but I did how do you have had this for a few months and I really mean to review it getting there its sell-by dates as well step up so nobody really matters everything from there we go yes it was very nice calorie-wise what's one those annoying ones where gives you pounds of grams and it's why soda great gives you power go there's a 90 grand bar so take off 10% for this mmm yes basically it's a probably 75 calories 40 grams of fats twenty four point three weeks of saturates here forty two point seven such as a fats 24.4 et cetera so if you take off 10% it's roughly 57 calories off mmm so basically yeah yes well I'll probably do a caption for it really but it's roughly 520 calories isn't it then temperature roughly thirty six point seven grams of fat then roughly twenty one point five thirty three of which is such as roof Li so again okay right so it looks quite a nice little bunnies tub bars again you know bit you know I did I do see Bailey zoom ones in a stir regularly in supermarkets but some tend to be sort of not this bar itself I don't know different you know different ones them yeah interesting okay let's give me an opener Fink's ghost got funny let's want the best way to open the top here it's a two by six five Utah State no easy ways you have to rip the file to open up things which I don't like I guess it seals the freshness in but well okay death they smell Bailey's crikey yeah it definitely says the bar it's up so bitter might say a bit too plain mmm you know 2x6 yeah it's 12 yeah bit too plain is not even any logo or anything on the honest things here she's a bit disappointing you know nothing they're just plain you know okay I am yes a bit Sam yeah bit dis so it disappoints him doesn't look too great that's all right there bit different but it's you know quite quite ergonomic having you've nice thing feels quite nice it's not saying yeah hmm feels quite big is your face feels quite nice yeah yeah what about who's quite smooth we go oh my god well the result it's come to this we've been shocked on the face but yeah anyway so there we go so he's quite yeah so hmm looks quite nice feels right smoo it's not melting my hands it's quite cold day there we have got heating on what's there yeah okay okay so that's Sam let's measure it shall we yes profligates so we're yeah about 15 just a 50-point to sense of ease as long at the bottom we've wise at some points for height wise that point zero nine go zero point nine centimeters there we go yeah okay yes again of curves up in the middle seems to curve up in the middle I know if actually does nothing it does but feels like it is from the bottom because it's kind of you know there's little indents at the bottom and it still feels a bit like it curves up them okay that's it get it cut in half there's still a bit sir in your kings okay so it's not liquid so truffle so where they go you can see their trophy sensor your death has a Bailey's smell to it hmm traction so uses quite a lot of chocolate in there as well you know that's quite nice did have an official description on the back I think I might vary with it but yeah yeah babies with Irish Cream Liqueur chocolate roll bar yeah there we go okay I don't think is much more to say I think we should get it give it a taste oh yeah let's say definitely smell of Bailey's when you open the bar and then obviously when you slice it theirs as well as well so see all right sir give one whole segment a taste mmm mmm good surfing I'd prefer to be a bit more creamy is quite doesn't really liquify in your mouth the truffle um just not chewy Iver you just doesn't really do anything you know so I think as it's Bailey's it expects to be more liquidy a bit more runny innocent I don't know if a truffle does it much favors really just tastes a bit like Bailey's but um hmm one mass of yourself hmm minkum the tacos okay well nothing great meaning you can't really taste the chocolate too much mother rough context that's that kind of al khali taste that sort of you know when I don't what the word is really just our collie tasting and that sort of taste that's a bit strong keno has that sir hmm that's awful the face quite quite does liquify but it doesn't liquify liquify you know which is a funny one then I mean possibly because you expected it to taste bit like Bailey's in there it does our side taste to it but hmm I feel like it should probably let you know liquid Bailey's in there really or something a bit more liquidy to simulate may is a bit better than the truffle just doesn't quite work as well as it you should do I don't think yeah well a lot of chocolate there as well and kind of detracts from the Bailey's taste as well really mm-hmm it's not like great a taste of chocolate it's not like green hmm it's a bit term somebody please not really anything the chocolate it's kind of like a bit of just err just suddenly have a taste to it you know yeah it's not unpleasant or anything but hmm it's not really soft milky it's not dries just he just exists [Laughter] hmm because it's quite lots of it it was even less baby sensation in there please okay though um well I think the fact it's a truffle doesn't really work really well for me it's not it's not a really a pleasant truffle um it's not very fluffy don't really have much of a texture to it II just kind of semi melts in your mouth but doesn't melt enough to it to feel like you having a bit of Bailey's you know mm-hmm it's okay I think I probably if you have so far for me these I think they're just to be average you're Pleasant quite nice mmm there's a small taste of Bailey's yeah but the chocolate is not pleasant but it just isn't anything really mm-hmm quite disappointing I think doesn't doesn't feel like a premium product the name kind of implies it will be feels a bit cheap mmm so maybe I can get him a place at home bargains I don't know yeah I just doesn't really have a literary taste that great with chocolate doesn't have a great Bailey's taste to smelled it baseline book mmm you know just not really not really it just misses the mark a bit really here's the gist on all fronts so there we go yeah shame but no there we go as long as you probably I don't know if you spent a bit more offing from the product address I

wait to see if my dogs are barking - could you guys hear me let me tell somebody tell me you can hear me is the is the mic on I need to wait and find out if there might be the mic is on yes you can't hear me fantastic well um I'll make this quick we've been talking about chocolate milk as you know because it's it's the greatest drink in the world and I and I love chocolate they're gonna have a lifelong love of chocolate milk and then I discovered a couple of weeks ago that you could put ice cubes in chocolate milk to make them even colder and even more delicious as if that's possible so we talked about that and of course I got the you know the amount of grief you might expect from the less enlightened of those on the Kevin Devine show and um and then Allie McKay you know her the this is why you failed lady she says to me she says what about instead of ice cubes made of water you do ice cubes made of chocolate milk and that way there's no danger of watering down your beverage that way the only thing that happens is when the ice cubes melt you've just got more chocolate milk which I thought that's genius like why is that not in the Bible right I mean that's that's just brilliant so I promised I would try it and I thought since you've been on this journey with me why why try it alone so here's what we got we got why why won't it work somebody says it won't work it's ice cubes right I didn't even know you could freeze milk and then I was reminded there's a thing called ice cream so apparently yes you can freeze milk so we have a glass which is really a mason jar we have dere gold chocolate milk this is how the walking-dead started someone said very funny we have milk I don't I should say this upfront maybe I'm a little bit of a lightweight but I don't drink straight chocolate milk because you know sometimes you're driving sometimes you're conducting surgery sometimes you have complicated things that you need to try and you don't want to be under any kind of crazy influence oh ma I got to go yell it to lightness so I'll be right back alright we're worried so yeah you don't you don't want to just drink straight-up chocolate milk especially if you're not if you're not used to it if you haven't to prepare your body up to it or something like that so that's why I do a mix of regular milk and chocolate milk just to kind of diffuse it a love it straight chocolate milk is the devil thank you very much I appreciate that all right so here's what you've been waiting for ladies and gentlemen these are the chocolate ice cubes all right so which goes in first I don't know if there's a I'm sorry this is a massive all right so I think I'm gonna put the ice cubes in first and then I'm gonna add the somebody's making fun of the Seahawks this is their Super Bowl xlviii championship t-shirt that was the last year they had a Super Bowl I don't know if you notice this or not but they didn't even even play the Super Bowl last year so the Seahawks are still the reigning champs cuz they won 48 all right so Ice Cube's first well I didn't predict this oh man I think I just broke my ice cube trees oh no my cheap-ass plastic ice cube trees I can't get the I can't get the kid I can't get the cubes out are you kidding me I cannot party hang on oh no are you seeing this the ice cube trays are breaking but the ice cubes are not coming out this is a colossal disaster this is the biggest waste of chocolate milk ever I filled this ice cube tray with chocolate milk and now I can't get the cubes out this is unbelievable oh no this is a brand new ice cube tray that I just bought at the Safeway all right this is not exactly this is a an experiment that apparently will have to wait for another day because I have to get the ice cube chocolate milk out of the tray well I think this was a great experiment and I think wait until they melt a little what warm water you're saying that's the that's the absolute that's the opposite of what we're trying to do here don't use water it will compromise the experiment yes absolutely let me grab a spoon let me submit me try a spoon this I can't even I didn't this is alright so now it's like a Shawshank Redemption type deal on the bottom of the tray get a knife on the bottom of the tray what are you talking about all right hang on ladies and gentlemen one ice cube alright so you got that going let's get a couple more out of here oh yeah they come out with a spoon you get the edge of it with a spoon there and they actually do pop out all right all right now we're in business all right this is not a disaster it's not the most elegant beautiful thing I've ever seen but we are getting closer okay there we go we now have chocolate ice cubes in the worse than the ferry ride how dare you at least you can hear me this time maybe that's why it's worse than this very right all right now we're gonna add a little bit of dairy gold chocolate milk let's try some of that all right I don't think I need a full glass and now to top that off a little bit of regular milk try toothpicks next time that's a good idea hi from Colorado hi from Seattle all right a little bit of milk there all right here we go you guys I mean look it's a little bit anticlimactic because there's no way that this can be anything other than excellent because it's chocolate milk for god sakes I mean it's hard to screw up chocolate milk so let's mix it up a little bit and here we go well I mean you know it's it's chuckling mooing and is he going to be tired all weekend now no visitors yeah that would be cut this is actually pretty exhausting this is a lot of work all right well I mean it's chocolate milk right but I guess I'm not getting until I get to the ice part I'm not really gonna get to the to the full majesty of the experiment but I would have to say that this is a success except for the fact that I need to work on you know I think maybe metal ice trays it might be the answer I think that might be what we need so anyway I just wanted to know I did I did follow through was it all worth it no absolutely was not all worth it but I want to thank everybody for joining me and go Seahawks and enjoy yourself some chocolate milk as well and this was fun right right okay see you guys tomorrow morning for a Friday Kevin meet you yes the payphone works it's an actual phone that I okay bye you guys

is forensics has to do with answering questions of a legal system so of course computer forensics answers questions of a legal system where it relates to computers so any sort of legal issue whether it's a trial or some sort of civil court case or any other legal proceeding that has computers involved with it in some fashion we're going to be talking about computer forensics so computer forensics may be doing something like analyzing a hard drive or looking at network data in order to find answers to questions that have been posed in a legal setting forensic investigations are concerned with maintaining evidence integrity so we want to make sure that the evidence that we gather is going to be admissible within the context of a trial of some sort or another the whole purpose is to find facts that further the case that is being presented in the trial or the court case so in order to do that one of the things that's really important is a chain of custody in other words we have to make sure that the evidence that we gather has a clear line of ownership so if i were to gather the evidence and i were to hand it off to somebody else there would have to be documentation as to the fact that i gathered the evidence and handed it off to somebody and we would both have to swear to that hand off when it happened and the state that the evidence was in all of that information really important in this chain of custody because the chain of custody is going to be brought up in the legal proceedings so we'll be investigating what happens on computer system that relates to the case that is being tried or looked at forensics examiner's may also be called as expert witnesses and this is when a forensic investigator gets called to provide testimony in a court trial if you are called as an expert witness your ethics and integrity may or will be called into question and so they are very important anything that you do must be very ethical and your integrity must be above question otherwise the evidence that you bring is immediately called into question and may not actually provide any benefit to the legal case that is being tried in other words your evidence may just be thrown out or ignored or thought to be inaccurate or not relevant or maybe even damaging in the end to the case that's being tried so forensics is related to courts and trials evidence is collected by forensic investigators and in the case of what we're talking about here the evidence relates to computer systems whether it's personal computers or servers or something going on on a network we're talking about investigation of computer systems related to court cases or court proceedings or legal proceedings forensic investigators may become expert witnesses in which kkkkkk kay Kay kay Kay kay

out what exactly it is it's different I'm glad I tried it you don't know that I'd do it again the chocolate is delicious lindt chocolate is is yummy but I feel like this is a little bit too much so little ambitious to try and get a strawberry cheesecake into a candy bar it feels a little chemically or taste a little chemically to me the cheesecake flavor and the strawberry flavor it's a very strong strawberry flavor it's a little chemically where the chocolate is not so not my favorite but I did chill it I did have it in the fridge which I think helps I think if it was not chilled I don't think I'd like it as much as I do but if you like strawberry cheesecake I'm taking it a try it definitely has a cheesecake flavor to it but again a little bit chemically for my taste so let me know

another chocolate review continuing with this brand which is Masseria Roth this particular one is the dark orange item in I don't know why I'm speaking like that I'm actually not French or German this is a German product as you can see here and the weight of this is 125 grams or four point four ounces so far I've had good luck with this type of chocolate seems to be a bit fancier type and meaning that it's a little bit more expensive but so far I've had luck with the at least with the first one that I've tasted which you can check out on my channel anywho this one is dark orange element so it's put me like orange flavor with bits and pieces of almond and we shall see about that first let's look at the some ingredients real quick we have serving we have five servings per container serving size is one of our and that one bar is 140 calories for those watching their diets we have some ingredients here the first one is chocolate which is made out of chocolate and let Keira cocoa butter sugar almonds let's see here I gotta flip this around to see concentrated orange juice so that's pretty interesting concentrated orange juice let's see here contains a less than 2% of apple puree that's very interesting natural flavor soy lecithin emulous fire and then we got some pineapple so the meme let me see if I can flip this around to reduce pineapples sodium alginate alginate and then we get citric acid and then vanilla powder also can contain soy and almonds contain soy and almonds may contain milk milk hazelnuts peanuts and other tree nuts I don't know why I struggle but that last part anyways if you're allergic to nuts kind of check it out to make sure you don't know you get allergies again it's made in Germany and we got five bars total now let's have a look this does have a nice fancy package package and the way you open this you pull this tab up like that one thing I've noticed well I'll tell you about it here in a second once you pull on it like this you can actually push it back down and - like if you want to receive it there's a little little catch thing there so if you I want to just to reseal it for later I can just do that it's kind of cool anyways as you may have noticed these come individually wrapped so this is why I think it's all that more fancier chocolate which is cool if you want to just grab one one of these it's 140 grams which is something really cool you can just grab real quick before you head out to work or whatnot just to have a little snack after your luncheon you know exactly how many calories anyways going to bring out my plate as usual I'm going to put this back in real quick reseal action for the presentation and then we're going to open this package up to see how it looks like and how it tastes like of course alright fairly simple to open just like my just like the other work you can already see the pieces of almonds inside then we're gonna do some snapping action I'm gonna snap it in half after we take a look off the other side which has the branded missa missa off and you can see a little dimples of the almonds almond pieces I bet thinner chocolate a little bit fancier looking oops but I'll put this aside and then we're gonna do some snapping action oh there was a little snap okay this kind of like is this these might be pieces of orange actually inside you see that I think these are pieces of orange you can also see it here I think this is a piece of orange oh that's interesting I'm gonna do another snap here I'm gonna do this one actually it's less of a snap sound but there's no crumble like very little crumble it's very it's usually sign of a better chocolate I'm gonna try this one that has a little piece of orange in it I think hmm hmm oh wow oh wow I like this I'm already tasting the orange I'm tasting the orange already sorry I'm trying to kind of capture capture the taste of it I'm pretty sure these are orange pieces you see how it's kind of like a bit there's a bit of a spring to it almonds are there but I'm not sure how much they add to the flavor they do add to the feel of the chocolate so there's a bit of a crunch action it does go well with the orange I have to say moments are usually very plain unless you put them in things like chocolate like this very classy taste is exactly what I said from the previous brand that our previous flavor that I reviewed which was this one there's a classy there's a classy taste to it very nice not overwhelming of anything but there's a really nice taste of orange inside of that which I really like actually it's very very not like assaulting your taste buds so you know what I mean it's like sort of like a respect to your taste buds in a way where it's the flavor is there it's something you would enjoy and you feel like you've actually bought something a bit more expensive because this chocolate is pretty expensive because it supposed to be like you know higher whatever I was going to say great so but as far as I know it is definitely a better chocolate type of chocolate that I've tasted very classy in the sense that the flavor is there but just the right amount nothing overwhelming and it's definitely it's definitely not dark chocolate it's it's more of a milk chocolate I like it I like it I really like it just like the other one I actually really like it we'll see how how it fares because I do have quite a few more of this same brand to review we'll see if that type of trend the person well there you have it guys that's the review of dark orange almond by Monsieur Rath German chocolate review

wife and two cats to feed not not every episode can have the budget of episode 1 and so I came across this for about 35 pence Mars chocolate milk now we all have a mars bar so I was intrigued so I bought this not much to you helpful instruction a consume on they are opening I hadn't really been planning and splitting this over two or three days but there you go right so let's have a will you look at this I get it she get out of it you do things properly now lovely chocolate milk colored you can see it's nice and rich in creamier doesn't just wash to faster back then [Music] this smells doesn't smell like a mars bar this smells more like yeah like hot chocolate drinking chocolate and I suppose there is a option heat treated milk that is nice that is really nice it's like play it creamy good feels it feels quite rich but it's not it's not overpowering that I overpoweringly sweet or anything this is and this whole thing there's 17 grams of sugar about 20 percent sugar Li not that much not what you get is he drunk so high I can recommend that that's like a I'd say four out of five because it's not late I have to go buy another ball right this minute but it's good night but hey if we're going to do a proper comparison what we really need is we need something to compare that against so what I'm going to give you I look at you Tony wait no that's how unique your Don investor that can be the real stuff doesn't have to be delta heat-treated stuff what chart clip don't know how much you use it's a bit of trial and error will see how we go and then a blitz it's actually a bit more vigorous I expect there's a bit more vigor listening spectrum it doesn't dissolve so well because there it's use design for whole milk oh that feels so fresh I don't know if it's there bubbles there's a bit more than in there that would compare by de Meyer skills retro the melt feels richer feels that it feels thicker and that's nice but this feels more refreshing and that's nice - oh the bubbles there is partly the bubbles they help oh yeah I guess I'm going for seconds and this sooner means that this one must be better so am sad booty I guess you win I don't know but

so how much flour 85 grams of flour and as I said only everything down below if you want to make these but you haven't been actually listening and stuff so you couldn't read it in the description line and 42 grams of cocoa smell need to do this song get 40 grams of cocoa we haven't got anything a bowl but I'll show you where ever you do sign beaten kind of strap goes a bit shiny oh and I'm just trying to show you there's the pan she's just greasing it with all of that happens and so I'm gonna try and make it so you would be able to see BM everything go in in me foul so cocoa powder and camera then we have e n 185 grams of flour and e 40 grams of cocoa how much should i do we need a key two hundred and two hundred and seventy five grams of sugar for the brownies so yeah I'm just

flour and cocoa we all do I want to do exactly so you're going to need three eggs but you might start with the sugar e you're going to want to put the sugar in a separate bowl and you can see over here and three eggs into these sugar here and I have them in a larger and make sure they are large eggs thick and creamy like there's a there is a bit of shell under the egg there there's three bits of shell if we take this over here and it will be bit easier come on oh no go ahead on the camera there's I got my community well looking good over here wait and I'm sure to come the chocolate there's the chocolate so far that's Nick chopper in the butter before just mixing it so just mix it so it gets along we drop the jug lid i think i just can show you the eggs there's a piece of shell in there again michelle so you have then you would have some exile unease now mix them up right then the legs and me sugar together and then just going to mix it with full 50 grams of white chocolate and 50 grams of milk truck flips and ice chunks nice shout always risk up like a milk consistency so can i drop the cash up the chopped up because i know how to break it break it into little bits first break it into little bits and want to quickly stop and then quickly stop and then name show you why are we and wait so you need to click that whisking it like that just really quickly until it's like a milk

50 grams of white chocolate so I'm just going to break them up into tiny pieces just move that over there a little bit we haven't got enough room on the table Oh everyone else so just moving the trailer it's in a little bit more rooms from your quick pop milk is really tiny just like with you has ahem mix this again the egg together for about five minutes and then using an electric wizard so you just going to do that I think it's like just so it goes like a bit of luck much like meringue text rugged a little bit of a my own texture so it means that I just now to be not be proud of

series of recipes and foodie chats for saint magnus cathedral during lent 2021 and if it is well what a brilliant way to go out with the chocolate tasting a chocolate tasting of ethical chocolates now if you decided that you'd like to join in and you did in fact get the chocolates that we told you about at the end of last week's honey ice cream video then this is the order that you need to have them ready to taste in front of you we'll be starting with the little bar the peruvian one then going on to the divine chocolate and then we shall be tasting the seed and bean then the and co and finally we will end up with the chocolate from love coco and i'm going to be joined in this by jill smee who is the secretary of the orkney fair trade group and she's got lots to tell us about all the different standards that are involved in chocolate production and ethically sourcing cocoa for chocolate so without more ado i must apologize a little bit because the quality of the recording isn't brilliant jill lives in dernis in the middle of nowhere and i live in the middle of nowhere in grimness so it's not professional quality but it's lickably good i hope so we're just starting off and we start with jill and i sniffing and thinking about our first chocolate which is the lidl she doesn't know that yet but if you want to join in that's what you need to have in your hand yeah okay this one is a 60 coco solid so it's got a lovely smell doesn't it yes if we were judging this we'd snap it right you get a really good sort of snap with a high cocoa solid so you do so there's a lovely aroma on this it's quite less than earthy and you've no idea what it is unless you recognize the the pattern on it but if we were doing this properly we'd let it melt on our tongue and it's actually quite bad form when you're judging to chew it but you know we are going to lose a lot of friends if we make this last too long really nice it's dry and quite earthy but quite fruity as well it is um concentrates the mind doesn't it just sort of slurping away at chocolate there's a lot of interesting flavors in there yeah do you like it i do do you think it tastes expensive slightly weird question well it tastes like a quality chocolate i mean you can tell that it's got plenty cocoa solids in it it's 60 percent and actually this of course is a fair trade one but it's little's jd goss it's there yep 60 cocoa solids and you will love it because there it is the fair trade logo well that's impressive because i've um i mean littles of a good range of fair trade chocolate they do yeah they really do some of it i haven't particularly like the taste of myself it's a really personal thing but this one i do this one i would certainly buy and of course how long have you been intere in involved with fair trade jill well i mean i've bought fair trade for years probably since since the label started 26 years or more ago but without really thinking that hard or knowing that much until uh the orkney group was was set up in 2011. right okay so i thought it might have been a bit older than that so it's your 10th anniversary it's coming up to yes fantastic party well of course nobody can plan a party but i'm sure once you can you will do something special yes i think we'll wait till we don't have to do it online maybe yeah as a group you know within the highlands and islands group which uh i know a few people down in venezuela uh the auckland group is regarded as fantastically innovative and you know really energetic in what you do yeah it's thank you it's it's good to hear that we've had some some very good links with the aberdeen group as well yeah who are they're also quite quite go ahead and have given us quite a bit of support actually from the early days which was yeah yeah fantastic right well let's taste our second chocolate are you up for that oh now when i actually asked you to do this it sounded to me a bit as though you had kind of a preference for um filled chocolates rather than bean to bar which is my favorite so i've tried to select some bars which are really quite uh flavored and this is one of them so this sample number b or sample b is much smaller and it's it's not as dry on the nose i can't find anything on this product that tells me how much cocoa is in it and it certainly doesn't have that big earthy hit that uh the um peruvian chocolate had no quite powdery hmm are you okay with us jill yes praise the lord because this has got hazelnuts in it yes no i'm i'm okay allergy free fortunately the snack does it no no it's definitely a low cocoa mass but it's dark and as it melts there's a lovely flavor of toasted hazelnut yeah if you like tasted hazelnut that is gorgeous i'm not getting so much chocolate no well that's always the balance isn't it you put a filling in and you drop the cocoa solids down but oh i love whiskey we haven't talked about whiskey but with whiskey tasting you talk about the finish and this has got a lovely finish that's really quite lingering it's very nice and it's not oily no so this is from divine again uh you know a fair trade as well where's my camera favorite but in in black and white not the colored logo but it's there and i was really intrigued because they've now added a medallion saying empowering women oh good right i have followed this company since very early days and um it's it's basically um the vast majority of the cocoa in divine chocolate comes from ghana with a little bit from sayotomi the chocolate is actually made in germany but it's all about empowering the women farmers um so that they can improve their lot but also the lot of their children and i guess that this is a message you find an awful lot within the fair trade movement oh hugely yes and then and there's such a big um in west africa ghana and quote specifically you know that's where the the major issues are around child labour yes yeah uh slavery and uh and in fact child trafficking into cote d'ivoire for the cocoa industry so you know there are some some campaigners who argue that you shouldn't buy cocoa from west africa at all because it's so difficult to have be confident even with fair trade chocolate that you haven't got child labour in the in the production um process but i think it's so important that there are companies like devine that are in there working to address it yes just turning their backs and and abandoning it yeah yeah and in fact in the very early days i can't find it on the wrapper at the moment and this is the divine deliciously dark smooth hazelnut but in the early days one of the things that really interested me about this was the fact that some of the finance began it started came from the body shop foundation and i used to have a delicatessen in sussex years ago um near uh little hampton where the body shop was and anita roddick was a customer of ours and it was always good for a 15-minute chat on the saturday about putting the world to rights but when fair trade became really big in the supermarket i did ask her what she thought about it and of course she was all for it in terms of getting the message out there has been a lot of sort of debate over it in over the years what what's your gut feeling it's difficult i mean we tend certainly an awkney fair trade group we're we're very passionate about our local shops and supporting local as well as fair trade so we tend not to promote the supermarkets other than the co-op which of course supplies a lot of our particularly the island shops yes and uh and the small doonby co-op but we tend not to promote the supermarkets but i think on a you know speaking out with orkney i'm it's a constant challenge this whether you work with the big boys or not yes if you don't you are just not going to have the reach yes unity and the supermarkets can tread a path between ensuring that there's decent pay for the producer and at the same time that they're keeping the costs down for for consumers and for a lot of people that's still you know quite challenging in this country yeah yeah the great thing about divine of course is that it's so widely available yes absolutely but i think we should try chocolate c yes ready for that one yep again quite a high um [Music] cocoa solid not well we don't know what the divine was but we basically had peruvian cocoa ghanaian cocoa and now we're going to the dominican republic all right and this is a 58 very earthy on the nose isn't it it is quite sharp as well though yeah well that could be fulfilling because this is another flavored bar right and i oh yeah i snap yeah well i love your snack so um we're going to have to do a bit of crunching i think to get this going now this is lemon lemonade cardamom or cardamom also it is isn't it oh i got the lemon first and then the cardamom that like anything cardamom it's very palette cleansing but the the lemon is making my mouth water oh and i'm really liking what's going on that's lovely but you do there's a good good chocolate taste with that as well so this is from oh there that's steed and bean so that carries your fair trade logo on it as well very proudly now i know i've seen sedan beaten locally i think in shearers yes um so i think so too might have been in curtness and gory i'm not sure but possibly even the brig larder they yes they carry into chocolate sometimes yes indeed but yes i wish that was seed and bean were more often more available locally because they are it's a lovely chocolate that is very nice and it's also a vegan one um you know there's a lot of vegan and dairy-free chocolates coming through now but um i've had their sea salt cornish sea salt and lime as well which was very nice um but that was more of a milk chocolate so knowing you're putting um porsche for higher cocoa i'm a plain sort of girl but those three that we've tasted to date have all proudly borne the fair trade logo but one of the problems in choosing responsibly made chocolate is that so many people are going off and doing their own thing and there are many different accreditations well that's absolutely right rosemary it is it's a minefield and when you say you know ethically sourced you really i actually did do a little bit of research about some of the different chocolate companies that we might be looking at and it is it's very hard fair trade are certainly moving a lot faster now on environmental issues and i mean yeah that's right they have needed to be yeah and that's you know i think there's there's certainly much more guarantee that you're going to find environmental issues being addressed with the fair trade label than there might have been in the past yes um the rainforest alliance have been the leader on that but unfortunately in terms of chocolate they do not um do anything about the low incomes or the producers and that is a critical issue and on a scale it's a critical issue environmentally as well because if folk are not making a decent living then they will be exhausting land clearing land and moving on yeah absolutely and looking for higher profitability crops it is very difficult because the next chocolate um but only two more to go jill are you okay well i can bear it because i have kept i've only been eating tiny pieces so i've got all these leftovers and chris knows what you're doing i'm going to be okay and i'm lining them up it's my favorites yeah lining them up in order right so um d big big big coco hit it yes yeah now this thing in central america and this is a colombian coco this one has got one star in the great taste awards which is a very um reputable and and you know it's a good marker really uh again it's flavored oh it's flavored in a very trendy way jill yes i'm going to struggle i think it's so trendy i'm not going to know what that is well the packaging will give you a a clue b b my goodness b pollen is incredibly strong and it's giving it that slightly granular texture like cocoa nibs give to chocolate yes it is i've just caught a piece of that but again on the finish it's quite an earthy chocolate you know it's sort of deep fruity almost tobacco-y flavors but yeah quite smoky it was what distracted me from the idea of it being honey but you know if you lick around sort of down at the bottom of your bottom jaw where the pollen is sitting there's such a huge honey hit but actually there is in the pollen wow who's whose mic is that and cone oh that's cops and go yeah that's a very small producer isn't it it is and all their cocoa comes from the lucca cocoa estate or co-operative so they don't have the fair trade logo but they're going that step further where they're originating their coco yes and sometimes you know sometimes they may be paying a farm gate price that's higher than the fair trade premium we just we just don't know of course unless you've got transparency around that um that's a huge flavor tremendous yeah let's finish off uh with chocolate e now this is 71 chocolate cocoa solids rather and the thing is oh this is colombian again so it's the same country of origin as cox and co but you're going to know immediately what's in this somebody lighter smell yes it is lighter but this is flavored with english mint and the mint in this um is a strain that was grown originally in mitchum in surrey there were huge mint fields and this traces the mint back to there gosh and it's you know there's minted mint just like there's chocolate and chocolate and this is immense this isn't going to be like an after eight jill why not they were exciting in their time remember oh gosh yeah weren't they it's very smooth very silky chocolate um i have silenced i have silenced you i'm just enjoying it now multiple of them all now because i'm basically a food writer who loves to drink i'm intrigued by this because on the back of the package it says pair this with beer something dark and smoky i have to say if you're a whiskey drinker it would probably go with an island malt or if you're thinking um highland park it would probably go with um dragon dragon legend i think it's called or with fresh mint tea and you can imagine that a synthetic mint were not a synthetic mint tea but you know a tea mint tea bag would just lose itself compared to this that's a lovely aftertaste that's right it's super isn't it this comes from uh love coco ah and this has no fair trade logo on it at all but it says it's slave free plastic free no palm oil single origin and eco packaging but it also says for every bar sold or one bar equals one tree so for every bar of chocolate that's sold one tree is planted um and it's it says actually in here the world's biggest producer of coco is the cote d'ivoire and that they lost 85 percent of their forest between 1990 and 2015. so again it's kind of that balance but i think one of the most interesting things about this is made by james cadbury who is the great great great grandson cadbury who started cadburys so this is ringing bells for you i can tell yes it is i had a good look at their website um yes um and uh met him there indeed yeah yes yes yes and that i mean they are clear about not um about where their their provenance is that they do work with them just a very small group of producers in colombia yes yeah i think i think one of the issues for um small chocolate producers is that the heroes will come and go and really having a label or an accreditation like fair trade will always give um you know what's the word i'm looking for it will give continuity well jill that has just been such fun to actually have a good chat with you um and to really congratulate you and and the rest of the fair trade gang on on your successful fair trade fortnight do you think you're all a bit shattered now but all zoomed out but also fun just to explore chocolate with you and [Music] you know to to to taste and get your enthusiasm because as i say chocolate is a food of love fair trade is moving other things on you know we can move on from tea and coffee and um you know chocolate and you know you've recently got a wonderful gold mark established so and i understand that's moving into silver as well you know why should the token of love be collected in such a dreadful way yeah yeah often with child labour involved in that very dangerous circumstance and the same unfortunately with uh with gemstones yes yes that will come as well yeah yeah yeah well what are you going to finish off with i don't know just to cleanse my palate actually i'm going to go back to the peruvian because it was the biggest piece i think it's funny we both really enjoyed that and there's a monday to wednesday chocolate i think that's perfectly accessible but it's terribly two-dimensional after some of the others but it's an incredible price it's only just it's fantastic value little fair trade chocolate it really is absolutely super so i mean all credit to them for that yeah well jill thank you so much and uh i'm going to stop recording now and uh it's just been wonderful to chat with you and thank you so much thank you and thank you for the chocolate", "p2BnXmBgE2k": "we make the best chocolate take some chocolate milk you see some Hershey's chocolate [Music]", "I4eYsjqsQFI": "otherwise so say I'm doing with this came that albino

eggs but there is no milk and eggs in the chocolate bar so let's try these chocolates I'm gonna try this one first only because I really like oat milk and I'm curious I'm curious the packaging is pretty cute I like the colors umm the bar looks like this I'm not sure if you can see these textures and these are ridges but oh my god so cool so cool I'm excited okay it's like melting in my hand cuz I didn't put in the fridge this little piece let's get it hmm oh this 58% Wow okay it starts off really dark because it is dark chocolate but then you can taste like the old milk and it's so creamy like the chocolate is really creamy mmm yeah the chocolates really creamy oh that I mentioned its cane sugar free oh it's really good I like this one okay guys you have to try this it's vegan

marshmallows makes this sweeter so it's not as bitter I like this one it's still bitter but with the marshmallows and mix it a lot sweeter and what this raka the oat milk makes it creamier so it's nice sweet as the chocolate sundae one the chocolate marshmallow sundae one but it's um creamier and this one is just really sweet it's like bitter and sweet together very good Wow I hope you guys

Scott I'm gonna go in my dad's shirt Oh", "rWPDps1IrRg": "hi welcome to today's little bit of chocolate education this is the first time I've done one of these and I've had a few requests to do a chocolate expert reacts type video because one of the things I often say is not all chocolate is created equal and it's true but it's also really difficult to tell what good quality chocolate is and when I run my online master classes this is something that we help educate people on because it's a question people always have they go okay your chocolates grade but how do I know if something's good easy answer of course is to buy from me but you're going to go out there into the big wide world at some point and need to buy yourself chocolate and the problem is there's a lot of what I call wolves in sheep's clothing but the packaging looks great it has all the right words on it and then you buy it and it tastes pretty poor and that happened to me recently I do like to try a different brand and I did find a chocolate that had all the right things on the packaging but when I came to eat it wasn't exactly that thrilled and I'm not going to tell you what brand it is because my initial reaction wasn't very positive to be fair I've only tried it once I'm going to try it for the second time now because I want it to be a very genuine reaction but what I'm going to do is compare it to another chocolate i discovered recently from a brand that i stock and cell which is michelle quiz L which I and I love and this chocolate is potentially becoming my new favorite now when I ordered from Michelle Clues L recently which is the stunning French brand there's one bar of this left so I will be getting wrong in stock I'm selling it soon but I decided to make it all for me this one now a few things about this one it's from Mexico and specifically it's a single plantation now that becomes important when we compare it to single orange and they're two very different things it's a 66% but as always percentage is a guide only because this has if my memory serves me correct I haven't tried it a lot it has a really rich decadent chocolate flavor now what we're going to compare it to is this one whose brand I don't really want to show you but this one here now I found it in a coffee store recently something that made me suspicious wasn't necessarily going to be great with the price 6.95 here in Australia which is actually quite cheap for a really good quality chocolate bar the reality is you cannot buy good quality chocolate for a cheap price because there's very few flavor beans in the world that are amazing and they cost money the problem is you can pay a lot of money for poor quality beans or poor quality chocolate so price isn't everything but you're never going to get good quality cheap so this was 695 little on the cheap side for good quality I to be expecting to pay somewhere between 10 12 13 maybe even $15 for something really exceptional now I have lots of good things on the packaging 75% from Madagascar love chocolate typically from Madagascar it's a very rich flavored chocolate full of lots of red fruit flavors one of the best producing countries in the world very different from African chocolate African chocolate and Madagascan should not be confused and when we do our online chocolate tasting classes we use Verona Manjari for example which is a rich beautiful indulgent chocolate now this also has some other things that sounds quite good on it it's a single origin but single origin is a little bit problematic that would be like saying a wine comes from Victoria or even if that it comes from Australia that would suggest there's no specifically in the beans as there wouldn't be in the grapes if he said that hopefully for that that wasn't necessarily the clearest thing the other thing they talk about here is they do themed about processing which is really cool the best chocolate in the world has bent above and they're talking about that so that's sounds good in theory and they use the word crafted a lot which always makes you think it's going to be great and if I understood this correctly I got the impression that it's both the beans are grown in Madagascar and processed either in Madagascar Africa they keep referring to Africa and I find it very strange because typically in the chocolate world as I mentioned Madagascan quality's amazing African quality is often really really poor so let's have a look at the two chocolates now to look at them they both look fine there's nothing you know who didn't want to show you the bread they both a lovely color they're both tempered well there's no there's no bubbles on the bottom or anything along those lines smooth or good on the smell but the smell is really important is a huge part of taste Michelle close L really fruity a little bit as the city comes a little bit like raspberries that's good and then our non-disclosed brand a freakin brand it it smells fermented acai here in Melbourne I'm a cyclist and here in Melbourne is a brewery of some description there and I go riding some mornings and you can smell that fermented yeast smell for the brewery it's like a little it's sorry fermented it's like going past a brewery okay that's not as a bad thing fermented is a I just had to leave that we ferment it is a valid taste okay so I'm going to start on the non-disclosed African very slash Madagascan brand one so I'm gonna pop it in my mouth as always short a few times move around let the flavors develop let's see what happens because I can't remember what I tasted with this trade I'll just start okay it's very fermented still okay there's a bit of smooth nuttiness coming through it was a bit funky but now we're going back to him oh that's not nice okay so it was a really nice mellow moment in the middle lingers terrible of nuts and smoothness on things that it's all these fermented funghi mossy add add earthy sort of flavors and it's not what I expect from a Madagascan chocolate I'm so disappointed anyway I have some water somewhere here excuse me for a moment it's so poorly done so not pro with this video I was going to try and get that flavor out a little bit okay let's give them a shell who's over there I haven't tasted this for a while either I'm bearing in mind I loved the assembly making sure that the right one um when I tried it and I thought oh my god this is my new favorite chocolate so let's see what I think of it it's hopefully gonna be better than that that's very strange chewing whilst filming yourself this week in a dark chocolate sweet lab from the flavor of the beans smoothie at the times I've been ill on really well-rounded really hearty smooth chocolate flavor oh yeah here we go because now oh that's delicious now there's lots of red berry flavor not even red berries fruity flakes maybe more sharp than that arm so maybe more raisins I'm a beautiful strong you little hit of flavor like raisins and there was smoothed off I was very balanced oh that's delicious that's so so nice okay then we're just gone off to this biscuity finish with just little hints of that raisin flavor almost like those um Garibaldi biscuits but not with many reasons terrible explanation that is such a different experience and that's the difference of good quality chocolate so that just goes to show why not all chocolate is equal so great thing to do grab a chocolate you know it's great if jump on my store for ideas or to buy something whichever works and then grab one to experiment with and try them together because it will really highlight whether one is good or not it's fine for it to taste different that's normal what's fine feed not to like something but obviously the reaction I had to the non-disclosed brand was not what you want in your chocolate longest video have record it now thanks for staying tuned go and try some chocolate and see what you think and enjoy happy chocolate

it's no secret I love all things Oreo and cookies and cream so when I found out that Milkha and Oreo came out with the Oreo chocolate bar I knew I had to get my hands on one well while these are available in over 20 countries internationally they're barely making the way to US stores which means it's about dang time we just made our own right so I'm just going to prep my loaf pan with parchment paper and then pour 1 cup of melted milk chocolate into the bottom of the pan place it in the freezer to set and then just pour 1/2 cup of white chocolate over the milk chocolate layer and put it back in the freezer now I know that's a lot of pouring and freezing and pouring and freezing but it's totally worth it to get those perfect layers next we're going to pulverize our Oreos in a food processor and then add in our cream cheese [Music] spread this out in an even layer over the white chocolate and press down so there's no gaps pour another half cup of white chocolate on top return it to the freezer and then one more cup of milk chocolate and then back to the freezer I am so excited [Music] oh my God look how amazing this is all those fun chocolatey layers it's so pretty

so we'll be right back when this is all melted okay so that cocoa butter has now fully melted I'm pretty sure you can see yep that the color has completely changed I'm just going to add my coconut oil now now I am using unrefined coconut oil because I don't want that coconut flavor in here I don't mind it but I'd rather not have it if I don't have to doesn't want to come off the spoon there we go you do want to be careful cuz this is hot these are oils essentially so is this healthy nope do I care nope okay so now we just gotta let these both like the coconut milk or coconut milk coconut oil fully melt and then I will bring you back for the next step and we'll be in a different spot at that point because we got to whisk the sugar and vanilla in so we'll be back in a few moments okay so the coconut oil is now melted and I'm just gonna use my hand whisk you can use electric whisk if you like it's just I don't feel like making another dish dirty because I only have the stand mixer we're gonna put in 1 cup of sugar I'm actually a little shy on the sugar cuz I don't want all of that sugar add it in there see I stir that up really really well [Music] mrs. powdered sugar as well I'm gonna write the recipe down below that I'm using okay now I'm just gonna add the vanilla you need a teaspoon and a half of vanilla and you wanna whisk this until everything is incorporated so not gonna make you sit here and watch that so we'll be right back okay so this is oh very well incorporated now I forgot I have an immersion blender I pulled that out and use that it worked great okay so I'm gonna pour half of it into this mold here which isn't a mold it's actually just a cake pan but I'm gonna pour half of it in here or about give or take half I'm going to cover this and quickly get it into the freezer so this can set so two seconds okay and with this half what I'm going to do is we have some candy canes down in our basement so I just took a little tiny candy cane and grind it up I got put that in there I'm gonna mix that up oh that smells good now I'm gonna pour this in this mold and I'm gonna do the exact same thing quickly pour it in and then quickly get it into the freezer because you don't want those oils to split and then into the freezer for an hour and I'll bring you guys back in about hour or so so right back oh I'll kick you okay so I just rolled this one out of the freezer the other ones still in there I can stay in there until I'm ready to deal with it now I'm just going to try and peel this back because I guess when I popped it in the freezer I shook a little bit so some of the chocolate cut right into the plastic but that's okay I'm probably the only one that's going to eat this so where is that started the other one oh I might have to bring you guys back in a minute right where I can so I think oh wait hang on I just do this mmm boy okay be right back I didn't get all the plastic off I don't know why I did that I completely forgot so I ran and says problem last time to use parchment paper guys so we're just going to cut this now so this needs to stay in the fridge of the freezer I leave it in the freezer this isn't a chocolate that you can just leave sitting out which is okay because it tastes good frozen mmm oh my gosh now this is just the plain one this one doesn't have the little bits of candy cane in it either way it's delicious so I'm just gonna cut this up hmm into pieces and pull off more of the cling wrap as I go and put it into a container so I hope you guys enjoyed the video and lesson learned don't do it I just didn't don't use plastic wrap use parchment paper I knew that too so I hope you guys have a good one and I'll see you soon bye", "fl2T7NoIoWU": "jump or toaster dot-com and this is McArdle or kinesio ricardo

what gummy if you say so so let's go get a medium to large sized saucepan chucking 250 grams of butter add 3/4 of a cup of milk one and a half cups of sugar in 200 grams of white chocolate now I just want to stir this over low heat until it's completely melted and combined we don't want to boil this all right that's pretty much ready oh yeah ha ha turn the heat off and we'll just call this into a large bowl and I just pour it into a large bowl now just leave it in here let it cool to room temperature and we'll get on to the next part that could take 45 minutes to an hour now get 1/2 a cup of self-raising flour and one and a half cups of plain flour and sift them and pour this in you can pour it in stages I usually just do it in one and just fold it through add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and two eggs that you've lightly beaten and just mix this in now get a cake tin I use a push-up base I find that makes life a lot easier this is a nine-inch ooh that should do and just pour the mixture straining oh look at that now pre-heat your oven to about 170 to 180 degrees Celsius which is about 350 degrees of Fahrenheit it should take about an hour to an hour and 10 minutes just check it out throughout 50 55 minutes if you stick a skewer in and it comes out goopy it's not quite ready if it comes out crumbly or even just just a little bit moist it's all good all right even that is looking awesome now just leave it in there to cool we want this to be cold or cool down and then we'll get on to the next part get half a cup of thickened cream you can also use pure cream whipping cream and bring this to a boil now while this is warming up get 350 grams of white chocolate now just pull that over the top once it's boiled and you mix it it's all melted all right looking good now you can spread this over the cake whatever consistency you want this to me is a bit too runny so put it in the fridge for about 10 or 15 minutes then give it a stir and if you feel it's thick enough or if I feel it's thick enough then we'll spread it if not do it again for another 10 minutes then give it a stir so it just gets thick enough to spread without going everywhere but that depends I mean if you just want it to go straight over the top of the cake not not a big deal but if you want to do the sides as well then it's probably worth just getting it set a little bit there you go and then spread your yummy white chocolate frosting whatever you want to call it put it as thick as you want just have it on top put it down the sides what ever the cake is done now just cut it into whatever size piece you want well I hope you like this look at top 100 hey the try cake oh okay but try it's a mud cake so it's wha you tell me what you think of that so yummy look at it I'll see

and do me a favor and click the thumbs up button for this video leave your comments down below I'd love to know your thoughts after you watch this video about whether you like that chocolate whether you like dairy milk chocolate or whether you just don't twitch auklets that's all people say sometimes that chocolate is bad for you because it's higher in antioxidants minerals such as zinc magnesium potassium but milk chocolate just tastes so much better why is that well we'll have a look in a minute so how much can we actually eat of either chocolate without putting weight on let's be clear about this it's not all bad for you chocolate isn't necessarily as evil as people think or what you need to understand this that is all about moderation sure people have told you in the past that everything in moderation is acceptable and we'll explore why because it's a natural balance of proteins fats and carbohydrates which is all that food and made up of however it's the balance of those carbohydrates fats and proteins within the food that you need to be mindful of so for example you wouldn't want to be eating pure just carbohydrates full of sugars because your body doesn't respond very well tonight we're storing fat and you can't eat as much of it as perhaps you would have some other foods that would not fill you up as much and require higher quantities of it before you have your calorie or energy balance reached for the day if you stranded on a desert island and somebody came to you and said all the food on this island that available is an orange or a chocolate which would you be better having well the answer would clearly be the chocolate because that would keep you alive for longer why is that orange has only one macronutrient there whereas chocolate has a number of balance of fats carbohydrates and proteins so therefore it would keep you alive longer now I'm not saying that's one reason why you should go out and eat as much chocolate as you want you absolutely shouldn't you should do it in moderation however it's all about context here and context not only in terms of our island scenario but context in terms of eating as part of a healthy balanced diet forget about all foods out there you know your vegetables your other foods that you eat whether it's Rice's pastas meats proteins they're all bill of the building blocks of macronutrients which eat carbohydrates fats and proteins and as I've said it doesn't really matter what sauce you get your carbohydrates from it just matters that it's a carbohydrate so if you're eating quite a lot of fatty foods it means you're going to be getting more fats in your body than you should be getting and your body will respond differently to laughs because it will produce different hormones it will affect you different rate at which you metabolize fat it will affect your insulin your body when you've got high levels of sugar and all these different things that you need to consider you don't need to get too much in the technicalities of it but what you need to know is that the good balance of carbohydrates fats and proteins in your diet is what you need in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle and chocolate can perfectly form a part of that let's take a look at this and explore this a little bit further over here we've got a breakdown of our fats carbohydrates and proteins within the chocolates so as you can see here the carbohydrates completely different in terms of the balance what you actually find the dark chocolate says it's got a higher actual calorie content so for example if you took this and you talked to this which one looks bigger well actually you would get more calories from the dairy milk because it's a bigger bar or per hundred gram what you would up to the end up doing is he in five hundred and sixty six more calories from dark chocolate so if you ate the same amount of dark chocolate your energy balance and your calories for the day would be high you're actually eating that but let's have a further breakdown of actually what that looks like in terms of where those colors are coming from so looking at this you have 56 grams of carbohydrates from the dairy milk chocolate now all those carbohydrates different types of carbohydrates such as sugars and longer-lasting high glycemic index carbohydrates and low glycemic index carbohydrates sugars you want to reduce as much as possible refined sugar as that Picchu in Chile helps makes your body metabolize fat and sugar really in my opinion and a lot of opinion of the experts out there is really the enemy now you look at this for dark chocolate you've actually got 34 grams of protein for grams of carbohydrates upwards 29 of sugars so your sugars are nearly half or you carbohydrates and all your carbohydrates that you're getting from the dairy milk chocolate come because of the sugar content where it is it not quite the same your fat content is around 41 grams but the issue that you've got here and you'll see there's not much difference in terms of the protein content now protein is good because protein helps control your hunger it also helps with cellular repair when you build in muscle and it's an essential building block that you need so you're looking here your protein values are very similar all you doing is you're having a high fat content and that makes up for the additional calories now your fat content daily should equal around 25 to 35 percent of your overall calorie intake with the balance being split roughly between carbohydrates and protein we've protein being approximately one to one and a half gram perhaps for a normal person per kilogram of body weight so you can see here that actually when you break it down into its micronutrients and what you're looking at that actually overall eating that chocolate doesn't put you in any better position than its evil twin brother dairy milk chocolate it's key to remember here that actually as long as you're eating it as part of a healthy balanced lifestyle and the key to regulating a healthy balanced lifestyle is having a good balance but making sure that the calories that you're eating don't over expend the calories that you're burning we've gone over it from time to time in these videos and I think really that's the key enjoy chocolate you can eat it as part of a healthy balanced lifestyle but what you need to remember is that it's all about moderation if you're one of them people that are going to have dark chocolate or light berry milk chocolate and you're gonna have not just one slice of it but you're gonna have the whole bar and then you're gonna have the next one then really you need to think about not even opening that bar and having chocolate is part of a healthy balanced lifestyle but one chocolate bar from time to time can be perfectly healthy - what's managing a healthy and balanced lifestyle and a healthy and balanced diet once again I hope this video has been useful I'm in a serious dilemma now because I have two chocolate bars and I don't know which one to eat hmm dark chocolate get in the chocolate [Music]", "7zfsK1m6lhU":

chip cookies take a look at those so good I had to take the bite so we're gonna start with a large mixing bowl with one cup of white granulated sugar 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and two sticks of room-temperature softened butter we're going to cream the sugar which means blend in the softened butter and you want to make sure that it is soft because this is ridiculously hard to do with butter sticks straight out of the fridge and once you have it looking something like this we can add in our wet ingredients which are 1 and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons of and one egg mix this together until you get a consistency of a thin toothpaste something like this we can now add one cup of all-purpose flour 1 and 1/4 teaspoons of salt one teaspoon of baking soda baking soda not baking powder baking soda and once that's mixed together pretty well and add another cup of all-purpose flour mix that together and then we'll add a quarter cup of all-purpose flour I find it easier to mix if I add it in stages instead of two and a quarter cups all at once and once we have it mixed together and we get something like this we can add our chocolate chips for this video I'm getting a little fancy and add one cup of white chocolate chips and one cup of milk chocolate chips blend that together until you're confident that you will get some chocolate chips and a scoop and here I'm using a melon baller and bake in a 375-degree oven for about 12 minutes you'll want to check them at 10:00 to see how they're doing and there you have it our chocolate chip cookies with milk chocolate and
