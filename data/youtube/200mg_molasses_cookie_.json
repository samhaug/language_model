{"vfSoP80zAnk": "- Do you love soft, richly spiced cookies that just scream holidays? Say hello to my molasses cookie recipe! This easy to make a little cookie is gonna be your new holiday favorite that you wanna bake all year round. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen where I, John Kanell,\nteach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. This molasses cookie will be ready in snip because there's no chill time. So let's get started. First off, let's sift\nall those dry ingredients starting with two and a half cups or 300 grams of all purpose flour. Sifting is optional, but I love it. You will never stop me from sifting. These cookies are getting\na big punch of flavor from three quarters of a teaspoon of salt. For leavening we're adding\ntwo teaspoons of baking soda. So one and two, in you go. Now it's time for the spices, and there are a couple of must haves and then some optional ones. One and a half teaspoons of cinnamon, one full teaspoon of\nground ginger as well. After these two it's totally up to you as to what you wanna add. Do you love cloves? Add a quarter to a half teaspoon of that. If you don't like them, meh. My favorites, as you\nmight know, are allspice, so I'll add half a teaspoon of that. And cardamom, cardamom adds just like a wonderful,\nalmost citrusy punch. For good measure I'm adding just a little bit of grated nutmeg. Sift it out. This is all done right now. Give it a good whisk,\nwhisk, whisk, set it aside. And now it's time for the butter, molasses, sugar, and the rest. These cookies are so good. I can't even tell you, because as you know molasses is not tasty at all. It's like, blegh. But when it's in a cookie, magic happens. (bright music) Just gotta put that out there,\nin case you're wondering. You can do this step either in a big bowl with an electric hand mixer, or using a stand mixer\nwith a paddle attachment. Both will work really well. One and a half sticks of unsalted butter at room temperature. And this is the magical ingredient. It smells like sin. I don't know who thought about-- You can tell me where this came from. Anyhow, one third of a cup, 80 mL. Drizzle it all in there. It looks beautiful. I just personally am\nnot a fan of the taste. Let me know in the comments,\nif you've ever like had a little sip of molasses, that mmmmm, delicious. We're gonna cream this up now. And yes, I will be scraping the bowl down, but get a nice kind of\nhomogenous mixture, if possible. (cheerful music) (machine whirring) I'm back. Okay, that looks pretty good. Let's scrape it down One more mix. (machine whirs rapidly) Okay, my butter and\nmolasses is nice and creamy. So it's time to add in\nthree quarters of a cup, of that is 130 grams\nof packed brown sugar. This is dark brown sugar,\nbut light will work too. You know that sugar mixed with\nmolasses makes brown sugar. That's all it is. Cream this up, light and fluffy. (machine whirs) You know the drill. (machine whirs rapidly) Once it's nice and creamy, just scrape the bowl down one time. That's all you need. I saw the comments by the way,\nwhere people were joshing me for saying just one more\ntime to scrape the bowl down, but then I scraped it down twice more. So sometimes it's an estimate. A little bit more of a mix. (machine whirs) While it's going lets\nadd in two teaspoons, or 10 mL of a nice vanilla. Ooh. Last wet ingredient is a\nsingle room temperature egg. Okay, let's get this nice and creamy. Okay, this looks great. Just so you can see it, we have a creamy mixture. And if it breaks a little bit, meaning it looks kind of granular almost, that's totally fine. The flour will fix everything. Speaking of which, it's time to dump in\nour flour-spice mixture. In you go. We're gonna mix this on\nlow until just combined. (machine whirs rapidly) You're always gonna have a couple of bits of flour here and there. So just use your spatula to fix that up. This looks great. Time to roll it out. One of the wonderful things\nabout molasses cookies is no chill time needed. You get to bake them up right away. Let's scoop the cookie dough out. I'm using a medium ice cream scoop. It says number 24 on there, but I have no idea what that means. Roll it in your clean palms, then roll it in sanding\nsugar or granulated sugar. If you haven't had molasses\ncookies, listen, I get it. You're like, what is this? It seems kind of weird. I like chocolate cookies. I like ginger snaps, whatever else. These are holiday\ndelicious, amazing cookies that I would have all year round. They are so good. No chill time needed, and\njust the depth of flavor the molasses and spices add is beyond. You'll have like a regular sugar cookie, it'll taste like cardboard, but not my sugar cookies,\n'cause those are amazing. (bell chimes) Click up here for that recipe. I guess this is like a gingerbread cookie. Hmm, there's ginger, and\nmolasses, and spice in it, but more heavy on the molasses flavor. These aren't gonna spread out a ton, but you will wanna give them\nabout two inches of space. My first batch of cookies is\nready to go into the oven. So we're gonna bake these at 350 Fahrenheit for 12 to 13 minutes. The edges will be set, but the\ncenters will still be soft, and will continue setting\nas the cookie cools. And if you wanna make these\ncookies batch by batch, go ahead and do that. Or you can freeze the\nrest of the cookie dough, roll them out, roll them\nin the sanding sugar and freeze them on the cookie sheet. Once they're frozen hard,\npop them into a sealable bag and they'll keep for\nlike two to three months. You can have on demand\ncookies so much more quickly. My cookies are out of the\noven, cool enough to touch. And just so you know, they're supposed to have\nall these cracks on top. That is a signature look\nfor molasses cookies, so don't worry if you see it. These have all been claimed. Everybody wants one\nbecause they are amazing, but we're gonna eat one together. Before I take a bite, if\nyou liked this recipe, check out my holiday cookie playlist, all my favorite holiday cookies\nin one playlist for you. But now it's time for a bite,\nand take a look at this. So rich on the inside. (soft holiday music) That is so good.

But first, I don\u2019t know if you know this,\nbut when I lived in San Francisco my husband Kevin worked at Zynga on one of the worlds\nmost popular social mobile games, Words with Friends. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it. This is actually when I started playing the\ngame. So I\u2019m delighted to tell you that this portion\nof the video is actually sponsored by Zynga\u2019s Words With Friends 2. So I\u2019m 7 months pregnant and I\u2019ve recently\nbeen thinking about how I\u2019m gonna stay in touch with friends and family once the baby\ncomes and also find time for myself. And that\u2019s where Words with Friends 2 comes\nin. I can still play my friends and family in\none on one gameplay, but now there are loads of new modes like solo challenge events, and\nfast paced team matches in the all new lightning round. Plus I can stay on top of my word game with\ndaily wordplay puzzles, which I\u2019m probably gonna need for a bit of relaxation, especially\nif I\u2019ve been up all night. Download and install Words With Friends 2\nthrough the link below and may the best friend win. Thanks again to Zynga and Words With Friends\n2 for sponsoring this portion of the video, now let's get stuck into our soft and chewy\nmolasses cookies. In a nice large bowl add in your egg, vegetable\noil, sugar and molasses. So molasses is the same as treacle, but if\nyou don\u2019t have it in your country do not worry, I\u2019ve got a really easy substitute\nthat you can make and it works perfectly. So you know me, I love when I can make something\nfrom start to finish by hand and this cookie dough is just that, so with a whisk we\u2019re\ngonna whisk all of these ingredients together. So these are our wet ingredients, just move\nthem over to the side, bring in a new bowl and now we\u2019re going to mix together all\nof our dry ingredients. So add in your flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger,\nsalt and baking soda. And then mix all of these ingredients together. So these ginger cookies have a lovely crinkle\non top and that\u2019s because of the baking soda. The chemical reaction gives you that lovely\ncrackly finish. Ok lovely so that\u2019s our dry ingredients,\nyou just want to mix it together so everything is really combined. So simply what we\u2019re going to do is bring\nback in our wet, and add all of our dry ingredients in there. It already smells like Christmas. So once this is ready we\u2019re going to pop\nthis into the fridge, I love to chill all of my cookie doughs for a minimum of 2 hours. It just kind of helps them set and makes them\nreally easy to scoop. So we\u2019re gonna pop this into the fridge\nand afterwards we\u2019re gonna get ready to scoop it, also you can freeze it at this stage\nit\u2019ll freeze really well for up to 6 weeks. So our cookie dough is chilled, it\u2019s ready\nto scoop so now let\u2019s bring in our cookie sheet. So line your cookie sheet with parchment paper. Now here I have a tablespoon measure and all\nyou want to do is use this to scoop your cookie dough, you want to be generous with your cookie\ndough it is Christmas, Nice big cookie, then just give it a rollie pollie in your hand,\nand then toss this in some Cinnamon sugar. And I have the recipe on BiggerBolderBaking.com\nfor the cookies and the cinnamon sugar. Get it nice and coated, this just gives the\ncookie a little bit of extra something. And we\u2019re all about being extra here on\nBigger Bolder Baking. And then just pop it onto your baking sheet. Then just continue with the rest of your cookie\ndough. So this cookie dough will make a lot of cookies,\naround 25 or 26 or so, nice big guys, so I\u2019m just gonna bake off one tray right now, so\nwhat I like to do is keep some dough in the back of the fridge then I always have it ready\nto go for when people drop over during the holidays. So there you go, that\u2019s our last one. Now with these cookies you don\u2019t want to\npress them down you want to leave them as nice little balls because they will spread\nout during baking. Also make sure you\u2019ve got some space between\neach cookie because like I said they will spread out and you don\u2019t want them to bake\ninto each other. But for right now these guys are ready to\nbe baked off. Bake your cookies off at 350\u00b0F or 180\u00b0C\nfor roughly 12-13 minutes. You don\u2019t want to overtake them so they\u2019re\nnice and chewy. So in no time at all your cookies will be\ndone and my kitchen smells amazing, just like the holidays. I\u2019m really happy with these because you\ncan see they\u2019ve got this lovely crinkle on top, really defined, and they\u2019re really\nkind of gooey in the middle which means, they\u2019re gonna be nice and chewy when they cool down. With this cookie recipe I guarantee you\u2019ll\nbe the most popular bold baker this holiday season. Oh my gosh, honestly, if Christmas had a flavor,\nthis would be it. It\u2019s warm, it\u2019s comforting, that molasses\nflavor, it\u2019s chewy, soft and chewy, just absolutely delicious and with all those lovely\nspices in there. This cookie is without a doubt a winner. I\u2019ll see you back here really soon for more\nBigger Bolder Baking.", "rAWMd4fXMrU": "hey everybody brother chef travis here and today we're gonna make one of my favorite cookies a ginger molasses cookie i first had this cookie at bake sale betty one of my favorite bakeries in oakland gosh almost 20 years ago and i found out this recipe is actually from a woman named alice nedrick so check it out first thing we're going to do is mix our dry ingredients together in a bowl so first we're going to take two cups of flour this is all-purpose to our flour we're gonna add two teaspoons of baking soda [Music] two teaspoons of ground ginger [Music] one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon [Music] half a teaspoon of allspice and a quarter teaspoon of salt now just whisk your dry ingredients together just to incorporate the mix [Music] all the spices smell really really good now we're gonna chop up about a half cup or so of crystallized ginger we need a half cup chop it's about two ounces um you can find the crystallized ginger in your grocery store looks like this and all you need to do here is just really finely chop it [Music] now it's time to mix our wet ingredients we're going to take eight tablespoons here of melted butter [Music] you don't want the butter to be super hot it's okay if it's warm but make sure it's not hot to that we're going to add a quarter cup of dark molasses half a cup of brown sugar and that's light brown sugar half a cup of granulated sugar and one egg [Music] now we just want to mix this well now we're going to go ahead and work in our dry mixture [Music] once i get to here before i add all the dry i'm now going to go ahead and add in my chopped crystallized ginger because i want to make sure that it is evenly distributed throughout the [Music] cookie [Music] [Applause] now it's really just to mix to until that flour is incorporated you can go pretty slow at this point you could do this with a spoon if you wanted to by hand or you could use an electric mixer [Music] that's it now i like to transfer this dough this cookie dough into a plastic container and i like to let it rest overnight you definitely don't have to do that but highlight so just pop a lid on it [Music] then we can move out to the fridge now that our cookie dough has rested and cooled we are ready to scoop and coat the cookies and sugar first thing you're going to need is to get your coarse sugar ready to go today i'm going to be using nielsen massey's madagascar bourbon pure vanilla sugar as you can see here it is coarser sugar which won't fully melt into the um onto the outside of the cookie so it provides some extra crunch and texture i need about a quarter cup or so um for these it's cool because once you roll them in there you can put all the excess right back into the container you could also use demerara sugar or turbinado sugar which is the less refined and also coarse sugar so either one of these is gonna work great the vanilla sugar will add a little bit of vanilla flavor um this will not so it just depends on what you're looking for now i've got my cookie dough here i'm just gonna go ahead open it up i'm using a two tablespoon scoop here what i'm shooting for is about inch and a half size balls and one of the best ways to measure is to use your temp sensor so here i have the temp sensor this is one inch up to this mark and this is at the right that mark right at my fingernails an inch and a half so [Music] let's go ahead and just make all five balls first now let's go ahead and roll them in the sugar it's really as simple as this [Music] roll it all around and i like to do my cookies in bravo in five for about the size of cookie so i'm gonna put this one smack dab in the middle of zone two right in the center of the tray and then the other four are gonna flank it like that [Music] all right problems preheated so let's get these guys into the top shelf all right let's see how we do it these are gorgeous", "3NW_r8J5jWA":

rolling right into another cookie recipe molasses cookies which are my mom's favorite cookies in the whole wide ropes you actually makes them year round we're gonna start with 3/4 cup of melted butter I just melted it in the microwave we'll pour that right into our stand mixer and then to that a cup of sugar okay so we're gonna blend these together perfect next we're going to add one egg and then we need some molasses so here's the trick it's really sticky so I'm just gonna spray this with a little nonstick spray and then pour the molasses in in that way I mean now you get the same slower than molasses here we go but that way the nonstick spray will help prevent everything from sticking so it all can easily be poured into our Bowl worked like a charm no molasses left behind I'll put this back down together perfect alright now we'll do all the dry ingredients so we need two and a quarters cup of all-purpose flour and then all the spices so we're gonna need a half a teaspoon of ground cloves to start and a half a teaspoon of ground ginger which is gonna give this nice really like kind of subtle spicy flavor and then we need one full teaspoon of cinnamon and then two teaspoons of baking soda if my mom was here she would tell you she would add chocolate chips and butterscotch chips but I like it pure and simple so just pop this back on and turn it on really low so the flour doesn't explode everywhere that wouldn't you [Applause] you can hear it starting to slow down which means it's done I just take this off look at that doe where it's gonna scrape all the dough down clear off our workbench and then we'll get to rolling we just have a baking sheet we have molasses cookie dough and we have a little bowl of just regular granulated sugar which is going to be the crispy parts on top so let's go ahead and just scoop out 12 cookies to start we're just going to roll each one of these in your hands warm it into a bowl and then we're gonna drop it into the sugar and roll it around and then we'll put it back on the baking sheet and repeat that process for all 12 of them so these are just going to go into a 350 degree oven for about 10 to 12 minutes look at those beauties we're going to take these off of the baking sheet and transfer them to a clean surface I can tell they're gonna be amazing they're chewy on the enzyme crispy on the outside everything I've ever wanted in life you can grab the full recipe on West Bobby cooking calm and I'm just now and we left alone [Music]", "q70Ug8c-UWM": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make molasses cookies and this is what they look like these are a really nice sugar coated cookie they have a soft and chewy texture and a really nice spicy flavor really hard just to eat one so to make our batter if you have an electric stand mixer like I have here use your paddle attachment you can use a hand mixer or really you could just use a large bowl with a wooden spoon for this so the first thing you will need is a half a cup 113 grams of butter I like to use unsalted butter you could use salt it and just leave out salt in the recipe and have your butter at room temperature I'm just going to beat this like a medium speed just until it gets nice and soft okay and next I'm going to add one cup that's about 200 grams of firmly packed dark brown sugar this will give us help to give us a really nice flavor to our cookie now in a pinch you could use light brown sugar and what I like to do is just to go with my hands because sometimes I find brown sugar can have lumps so if you just run your fingers through that just to make sure there isn't any now I'm going to beat this on medium high speed just to get a little air in there get everything all mixed together so for maybe a couple minutes okay so see ya eggs all mixed together we got a little error and I'm just going to scrape down the sides and bottom the bowl make sure everything gets mixed together and the next ingredient we're going to add is one large egg have your egg at room temperature and along with a half a teaspoon two grams of pure vanilla extract that's just for flavoring just going to beat that in okay and of course we're making molasses cookies so we need molasses so I'm going to add a third of a cup 80 milliliters or about 115 grams I'm using a light unsalted molasses and whenever you're measuring out a sticky ingredient like this what I like to do is either you could lightly oil the inside of your measuring cup or spray it with one of those nonstick sprays because then it will come out a lot easier this adds such wonderful flavor to our cookies and then I'm also adding two tablespoons 20 grams of a flavorless oil you that could be like vegetable corn canola sapphire and that's going to give us that nice soft kind of chewy texture to our cookies so I'm just going to be fat in as you can see that molasses is what gives us that really distinct color so now in a separate bowl I have two cups that's 260 grams of all-purpose flour you may know that is playing flour to that I am going to add one teaspoon four grams of baking soda quarter of a teaspoon one gram of salt I like to use a kosher salt I find it's a little milder tasting than say a table salt but either one is fine and then for the spices because nice spicy cookie one teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground ginger and a half a teaspoon of ground cloves so nice I mean it's really hard to eat just one of these so I'm just going to I'm just using a wire whisk you can sift all your ingredients together you want to really make sure that that baking soda is mixed in with your flour okay and then I'm just going to add my flour and beat this in till everything's all combined you want to start on a low speed so you don't want that flour coming up in your face it's pretty good so I'm just going to add some flour on the sides my bulbs get that down I'm just going to beat that just for your seconds longer that's our batter now we will have to chill this because it's you can see it is a soft batter right now so I'm just going to put it in a bowl cover it with plastic wrap and put it into my refrigerator you want it to be firm so I mean that takes say two three hours at least what you could do is I find you can leave this in the refrigerator for a couple days so you can make the batter today and then bake off your cookies tomorrow so that's what we're going to do and then when we come back we will bake off our molasses cookies so now when you are ready to bake off your cookies pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit which is 190 degrees Celsius and then you will need to you can line your baking sheet with parchment paper or you could just lightly butter it or spray the pan with one of those nonstick sprays so you want your batter well chilled and then what we're going to do is to roll it into one-inch which is two two and a half centimeter round balls if you have a scale as you know I'm always going on about you could just weigh which I find easy you will need 20 grams for each round ball and then just some roll it and then on a plate or a bowl just put about a half a cup 100 grams of granulated white sugar because we're going to roll our balls in the sugar if you didn't want to use I'm just using regular granulated white sugar you could use one of those sparkling sugars if you would prefer a little Sparkle so just coat it nicely in there and put it on your baking sheet I find they will spread out so space your cookies about a couple inches about five centimeters apart and then once you have all your the round balls cookies on there just take a glass or something flat and then just just flatten your cookies just a little that'll help them spread out so now and then if you want sometimes I do you could once you flatten them you can put a little extra sugar for good luck on the top so now for baking everyone's oven is a little different whereas with all cookies you know a minute or two can make a difference in the texture of your cookies you may want to just for if this is the first time you're baking these you might want to do like just a couple cookies just to kind of get your baking time in your oven down but what we're looking for if you can see these cookies there they do have like cracks or crinkles in the top so what happens is they spread and then as they bake a little longer you start to get these cracks and that's when you want to take them out they all want to me if you want them nice and soft my family they like them soft and chew then take them out where you kind of look at them and go I don't know maybe they needed another 30 seconds no take them out if you want them soft of course the longer you bake them the more firm and chewy they will be so I find somewhere between the eight and the ten minutes okay so our molasses cookies are done so put your baking sheet on a wire rack you can see nice cracks they kind of look it's one of those where I kind of well should I bake them a little lot no I'm going to take them out whenever you're baking cookies but halfway through the baking time rotate your baking sheet front to back just so they bake a little more evenly so now these are very soft I'm going to let them cool like in the baking on the baking sheet for about five minutes and then just use a spatula to transfer your cookies to the wire rack to finish cooling and then when we come back we will try one so now let's try one these are still just a little warm that's how I like them nothing like a freshly baked cookie the outside especially the day there may is a little crisp and then really nice and soft and chewy just how my son's used to like them and the flavor you know the molasses and then you get the dark brown sugar and then you know the cinnamon ground ginger clove I mean all that adds up to a really great taste including lots of flavor so it is really hard to eat just one so try these ones and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Joey baking calm you", "q4Ss1GeR9YI": "hands down these are the greatest ginger molasses cookies in the world these cookies are the ultimate spice cookie they have loads of ginger and molasses flavor a little bit of a salty sweet vibe going on and the inside is soft and chewy with a beautiful crunchy sugar topping when the anthony

gonna add two generous teaspoons of ginger to the mix it's not a spice cookie without the cinnamon a teaspoon of cinnamon going in and last on the spices we're gonna add a half teaspoon of cloves also going into the dry mix we're gonna use one teaspoon of baking soda not to be confused with baking powder one teaspoon of salt and we'll just whisk it all together if you are not in to the salty sweet thing cut that salt back to about a half teaspoon and you all remember you never ever ever have to remember any of these increments they're going to be written out for you at the anthonykitchen.com

gonna add some canola oil this is going to make your cookies extra extra delicious and moist so that was a three-quarter cup of canola oil and i know that it's irritating when you have to use two different measuring vessels but this really really makes a difference and how easy the cookie dough is to work with and how moist and tender your cookies bake up so we're gonna add an additional two tablespoons to the mix now to that we're gonna add some molasses here's a little tip be sure that you measure your oil before you measure your molasses and it'll make your molasses come out of the measuring cup way faster just add the molasses straight to the bowl now you're going to crack one large egg in there we're going to mix this on medium high speed if you don't have a stand mixer you

gonna add our dry ingredients with all those yummy spices and it's gonna smell even better this time we're gonna mix on low so that we don't over develop the gluten and your cookies stay really nice and soft the dough is looking fantastic and now we're going to ready our baking sheet you want to have it lined with either a silpat or parchment paper i'm going to come in with my medium sized cookie scoop and get a nice big scoop and then as you can see this dough gets kind of crackly on the top even when you use a cookie scoop so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just pinch it a little bit with my hands and then cup them and roll it into a perfect little ball just going to do this on repeat a few more times until all the dough is scooped the dough balls are ready for their makeover

which I don't like because most of the beets nowadays in the US are GML okay but the point is that unsub lack strap molasses comes from typically comes from sugarcane so here they take out this refined product which is pure white sugar okay and brown sugar is just a little bit of molasses okay but then they shoot away this waste product where they just sell it as molasses molasses is where you have all the nutrients specifically the minerals certain B vitamins I mean it's rich with potassium and zinc and silica and the trace minerals massive amounts so it's really I think a good product and a small amount for kids or people that are not trying to lose weight and don't have a blood sugar problem I know some people are like well can I start having this and like we'll hold on just use it as needed as a tool to solve a problem if you want like a spike of minerals but again it will stop weight loss because it does have some carbohydrate a little bit of carbohydrate and they're not compared to white sugar but it does have some sugar in there because they haven't completely taken it out but here's the point I I like the benefit of this in certain situations with women that have anemia specifically if they have like a fibroid issue or heavy bleeding with their cycles this is probably one of the best sources of iron okay so that's one indication and the other one is that for kids that are hyper and they're like running all over the place and eating all this white sugar white sugar depletes you of potassium and minerals blackstrap molasses puts it right back in potassium is a physiological tranquilizer it helps the nervous system it helps apply to fight system it calms the nervous system down the Tassie 'm helps you store sugar in your liver as glycogen and how so you go longer without those dips in the blood sugar issues so it's good for certain types of low blood sugar issues but black mass a black sunsoft word means that it doesn't have the sulfuric sulfur dioxide that they put in there so it's a lot healthier if it's unsalted and again you know keeps them in your fridge use it if you have anemia make some recipes for your kids or yourself occasionally if you're not trying to lose weight but I think it's a really good remedy and natural remedy because it has so many minerals and thanks so much for watching and before you go click the link below and take my quiz and find out the root cause of your problem", "5NRorikjEvg": "Cream the room temperature butter. Add brown sugar and beat until incorporated. Don't mix for too long. Add in the egg, then mix to incorporate. Add the corn syrup. Whisk to combine. Combine the AP Flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking powde, baking soda, and dark brown sugar together in a bowl. Sift into the butter mixture, then use a spatula to mix. Mix only until the dry ingredients are not visible. The dough smells like spices. I like ginger powder and cinnamon powder, so I put in a little more for a stronger scent. The amount of Ginger powder or cinnamon powder should be adjusted according to your preference. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes Divide the dough into portions that weigh 20g each. There's a lot of cookie dough in the video but the recipe listed has been reduced. It yields only about 15 cookies. Roll the dough into a ball, then roll it in cinnamon and sugar. Since the cookies will spread substantially, please space the cookies farther from each other. I baked for 8 to 9 minutes at 180\u00b0C (356\u00b0F) The cookies are very soft when taken out of the oven. They look really beautiful too. I really like the chewy texture ^^ It's sweet and chewy. Thanks for watching^^", "2QJuzAL_Osw": "today I want to share with you what I call the busy Mother's sourdough and this is for all of you who have written to me in email or comments and shared your frustrations with trying to get a sourdough starter going and then trying to make sourdough bread and having it all just become a bit of a disaster either you can't get your sourdough starter going or you think you've got it going and you try to bake bread with it your sourdough bread doesn't kurai as it doesn't come out well and you're just ready to give up well don't give up because I've got a little tip here for you that's gonna change everything and even if you're not a busy mother but you've struggled with sourdough this is for all of you hi sweet friends I'm Mary and welcome to Mary's nest where I teach traditional cooking skills for making nutrient-dense foods like bone broth ferments sourdough and more so if you enjoy learning about those things consider subscribing to my channel and don't forget to click on the little notification bell below that'll let you know every time I upload a new video now I can't take credit for this very clever idea this was developed by a girl friend of mine many years ago we were homeschool mothers together and she was definitely a busy mother she had six children but she really was very devoted to making the transition from a process foods kitchen to a traditional foods kitchen and she wanted to be able to incorporate sourdough bread into her family's diet but so many times she tried to start the starter and it wouldn't work out or she'd forget to feed it or she'd finally get it going and put it you'd get ready to make her bread and have her dough and then she would get distracted because she had to take her kids somewhere or do this that or the other thing and then the dough would over rise and sink it was always one problem after another but then she got an idea she came across a book which at the time was new but now there have been many versions of this book and it was the book bred in five minutes a day but she thought what if I make the dough as is described in that book which we're gonna go over today but instead of using so much yeast I use just a very tiny little pinch of yeast and then I put everything in the refrigerator and let's see what happens well that's what we're gonna do today and we're gonna see what happens well what my friend theorized was could she mix all of this together put it in a plastic container and then not worry about it and just put it in her refrigerator and then when she had the time to bake bread take it out take out as much as she wanted to make a loaf or a couple of rolls whatever the case may be give them time to rise and bake them and be done with it not have to worry about scheduling everything so perfectly about the rise you know the mixing and the rising and then the punching down and the rising and so on and so forth and what she learned was that in fact yes you could do that and this was all outlined in the book bread in five minutes a day but she wanted to take this one step further an experiment what if she put three and a half cups of flour a cup and a half of water these other ingredients the salt the sugar and a little bit of yeast in here let it rise in the fridge pulled it out to bake and took three cups of the dough or a little more whatever the case may be to make her loaf of bread and left enough in her little bin that was maybe equal to about a half a cup and with that half a cup she then went and added three cups of flour and 1 cup of water and maybe a pinch of sugar a pinch of salt no more yeast though mixed it all up with that little bit of dough ball that she had left in there and put that in the fridge would that be enough to allow the next set of dough be able to be turned into into a nice loaf of bread and what she discovered was yes it was sufficient and then she further theorized that over time it slowly took on yeasts that were just in the air in her kitchen and became her busy mother's sourdough starter because she never added any more yeast she just fed it once a week with more flour and water of giving her some dough ready to bake bread or rolls or whatever the case may be she went on to double the recipe often in a bigger container never adding any more yeast just leaving that about half a cup of dough in there scraping down the dried sides on her container leaving the lid off while she'd be working in the kitchen hoping some natural yeast would be coming in there and what she found over time the taste of her bread started to mature the texture started to mature it looked more like sour dough tasted more like sour dough so as far as she was concerned concerned it was sour dough and I think that this can be a wonderful solution if you have been struggling with trying to make a sourdough starter or sourdough bread well to try this method what you're going to need is some flour it can be all-purpose flour or it can be bread flour but I really recommend just starting with plain flour not a whole grain flour in future videos we'll talk about how to transition this and do this with whole grain flours but just to get this going I highly recommend you use something just very simple and plain next you're going to need a teaspoon and a half of salt I've just got a plain fine ground sea salt here but use whatever you have and then I've got a tablespoon of sugar this is an organic unbleached sugar but again use whatever you have in your kitchen and if you have made the transition to a traditional foods kitchen and you are incorporating whole sugars into your diet you can certainly use the dried cane juice known by the name sue can add or anything along those lines maple sugar will work date sugar would work any any type of sweetener you just need a little something and then you're just gonna want a quarter of a teaspoon of yeast and this can be active dry yeast or instant yeast it doesn't matter and next you're gonna need about a cup and a half of water and this can just be plain tap water you don't worry about it being hot or cold it doesn't matter room temperatures fine and you're gonna need one more thing and that's some type of container this is just a plastic food grade Rubbermaid container and I like using these type because they're easy to put in my refrigerator and we're gonna be putting all of this into our refrigerator but if you have a flat plastic container again that's food safe that's fine or a glass container that's fine too whatever you want to work with it just needs to be large enough to hold three and a half cups of flour and one and a half cups of water and room to stir it all together and it has to have some kind of cover on it now the first thing that we're gonna do is to our water we're just going to go ahead and add in our sugar and then we're going to go ahead and add in our yeast and don't worry if it's just room temperature it doesn't need to be so warm we just need to mix that up before we go ahead and add it into our little bucket here now I'm using active dry yeast if you're using instant yeast you can go ahead and put everything in to your container in one fell swoop you can add in your flour your salt your sugar your instant yeast give it a real good mixing and then add in your water but since I'm using active dry yeast I'm going to dissolve it first in water with a little sugar and if you want a discussion of the differences between instant yeast and active dry yeast I cover that in another video and I'll be sure to link to that so if you want to watch and I'll put the time stamp in so you can watch that discussion but all you need to know is you can use either or here now I'm just using the little plastic measuring cup that came with my flour container and this is very forgiving so don't worry you don't need to be super exact but I'm just going to go ahead and measure out my three cups we're gonna put a total of three and a half cups in here and then that's just my final half cup of flour then we'll go ahead and get our salt in there and we'll just give this a real good whisk around just to make sure we get that salt very well distributed throughout the flour and I just want to mention I'm not worried I just wanted to mix this yeast throughout the water with the sugar but I'm really not worried about the whole blooming process my yeast is well within its expiration date and the only reason that I'm mixing it with the water is to just make sure that it's well distributed since it is an act of dry yeast I just want to get the little bit out of the bottom there because I know many of you have told me that you really don't even worry about blooming or mixing your active dry yeast with water if you know that it's well within the expiration date you use it very similar to you the way you do instant yeast and you just throw it right in so that definitely is an option if you're comfortable doing that then I'm going to take a wooden spoon and I'm just going to start mixing this right in the container now you want this to be very wet and Shaggy the wetter the dough the better so if you feel that it's too dry by all means add more water now the consistency of the dough that you're looking for should be very wet and shaggy like this and I'm going to take a close-up video so that you can see what this dough is like very wet like that see how that's just falling right off the spoon then just clean off any extra dough that's on your spoon and get that down into your container a little bit of a sticky wicket I don't like to waste anything and then we'll go ahead and move on to the next step next all we need to do is put our lid on and it doesn't need to be super tight this doesn't need to be an airtight container nothing like that even in this case I'm just gonna kind of leave this corner a little loose there and now I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna put this in my refrigerator and I'm just gonna leave it there for a day day or two and then I'll bring it out I'll show you how the dough looks and we'll proceed with making bread and then we'll try to make another batch of dough to put in the fridge and then over time I'll follow up with future videos showing how the texture and the taste of the bread changes over time to being more of a true sourdough well I left this in my refrigerator for two days and I am so impressed with all the beautiful bubbles that have formed in this dough and I'll take pictures and I'll overlay them from the front and the side here beautiful bubbles and it's amazing just from that little tiny bit of yeast and the aroma is quite lovely not the least bit heavily yeasty or / yeasty it's just a very very mild aroma well now let's take out about three cups worth and we'll make a loaf of bread the first thing I'm gonna do is just flour my board but very lightly I don't think we want to get too much flour into this dough because we do want to keep it very wet because apparently keeping it very wet is what really helps make a lot of that carbon dioxide gas which is what creates all those wonderful bubbles and hopefully now having a little bit of flour on my hands will make getting this out a little easier so as you'll see this is very wet and gloopy now what I did was I kept scissors handy just in case I had trouble pulling off that little bit that I want to leave left in there and that's actually it's not quite a cup I'm gonna add a little more but I think my friend was never particularly super exact about it she would just leave maybe somewhere between the size of a golf ball and a baseball so maybe a half a cup a cup she wasn't really exact about it which is kind of what I really like about this now it's very wet and gooey but you shouldn't be able to pull your hand off of it there'll be some some dough that'll stick but it's really not too bad so let's try and just shape this the nice thing is this is no need so all we need to do is just get a nut flour on our hands to just do the tuck and shape method so to speak where we're just going to shape this into a bowl now what can really help with this process is having a little plastic bench scrape like this or if you don't have it don't worry a spatula if you have a little plastic spatula that'll work well too but I'm just trying to get a little more flour on my hands here but not overdo it and scoop it out like that and just trying to shape this just that little shape and tuck method it's quite sticky I'm resisting the urge to put too much flour and if it I just keep flouring my hands and trying to tuck this little ball under without picking it up it seems like when you pick it up it's just a little - a little too wet but doing like this is working well I just want to get it into a nice smooth ball now one thing I want to mention if you have a pizza peel and a baking stone you can do what I just did right now on my board on your pizza peel and then when we get ready to bake this you can just shake it off your pizza peel and put it into a right onto your baking stone but I know a lot of folks have its appeal and a baking stone so the other options are you can just take a baking sheet put down some parchment paper or aluminum foil whatever you want or you could even just bake it right on your baking sheet but what you want to make sure that you do is put down a little cornmeal or a little flour so nothing sticks and then you can use that to bake it with another option is you can go ahead and do the Dutch oven method with this bread you can put it on parchment paper and lower it down into your hot Dutch oven and bake it with the cover on and bake it that way or if you want you can just pop it right down into your hot Dutch oven some of you have asked me do you really need to use the parchment paper and the answer is no the original method of that Dutch oven bread by Sullivan Street Bakery they didn't use the parchment paper they were just dumping it right into the the hot Dutch oven the parchment paper is really basically I don't have to say invented but started primarily by home cooks who were a little nervous having to get the get their dough and drop it down into that hot Dutch oven so but you can do it either way and but I thought that the easiest way would be to do this on the baking sheet because most folks have bacon have a baking sheet and if not you can take a couple of sheets of aluminum foil and sort of turn it into a mock baking sheet and bake it like that so I've got my baking sheet over here and I've just got a piece of parchment paper on that and I'm just gonna try to pick up my little dough ball here best I can and get that onto there nicely shaped and now we're gonna let that rise for about an hour and my girlfriend never covered hers so I'm just gonna leave it uncovered but if you feel more comfortable to cover it you could use a dish towel and just make sure that it's brushed with a little flour that so it doesn't stick now a couple of tips number one I understand that you may not see a lot of rise out of your bread but don't worry about that it should get a little bit of rise a little bit of what they call the oven spring when you put it into the oven and speaking of the oven you'll want to pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit 20 minutes before you're ready to put your dough in so as this is rising for that hour 20 minutes before that hour comes to an end be sure to pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit now I have a very small oven so I tend to bake my breads in the lower third of my oven because if I put breads on the middle rack they're actually very close to the top heating element and I find that they can Brown too quickly so that's just a little tip I want to share with you if you have a very small oven like me you may want to put your rack in the lower third of your of them but if you have a big oven and you're used to baking breads and so on and so forth on your middle rack and everything comes out fine then that's great now we come to the fun part I haven't here maybe about a half a cup of the dough and that's just what you want you just want to have some in there to help give our next stage a nice boost and what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and add in our three cups of flour we're just going to do three cups because basically we've got more or less that 1/2 cup of dough in there this is my third cup of flour alrighty so we've got that and now I'm gonna go ahead and add in 1 tablespoon of sugar very much like we did the first time around I'm going to do this just until I feel this gets established once I feel that I'm seeing a nice rise in my container and a lot of nice bubbles I'll pull back on the sugar and I'll just let the yeast that's growing in here eat the flour and you get its nutrition from the flour and no longer add in the sugar because sometimes if you add too much sugar you can encourage the growth of good bacteria now that's not necessarily a bad thing because both the yeast and good bacteria can rise your bread but there are taste differences as opposed to if you have the natural yeast which we're hoping to encourage to grow in here rise our bread versus the good bacteria and this time around I'm going to add just one teaspoon not the one and a half teaspoons of salt and the reason for that is since we do have about a half a cup or so of the dough left in here which has some salt in it I don't want to add too much salt so I'm just going to go ahead and put that 1 teaspoon in there and then to start I'm going to add about 1/2 in a cup a one and a half cups of water and this is just plain room-temperature water and that's just about a cup and a half we'll see how it goes it may need more if it's if it's very dry we may need to add more water because you do want this to be a very wet dough if for any reason we added too much water and it's too soupy we can always add an extra flour it's very forgiving now if you have one of those Danish dough whisks you can get in there and and mix this up or you can just use a wooden spoon or if you watch artisan bread with Steve he always likes to use the handle of his wooden spoon and I think that's going to work best for this type of preparation so I'm just gonna get in here and mix this best I can well this is mixing up nicely but it's a little drier than I would like so I'm gonna go ahead and just add a smidge more water just maybe about a quarter of a cup or less and I'll continue mixing it till I get to the consistency that I like and I'll show you how it looks well I think that little extra bit of water was perfect and I'll overlay a video so that you can see it's hard using just it's hard scoop it it's easy mixing it with the handle of the wooden spoon was a little hard scooping some out but I want to show you how wet this dough is and I think that's perfect now I'm just gonna clean off the handle of my spoon and then we'll put the lid on and we'll pop this in the refrigerator so I'm gonna put my lid on again not airtight I'm actually gonna leave this little one on the end a little loose and I'm gonna go ahead put this back in my refrigerator and we'll check on it in another day or two and we'll see if we got any bubbles and how things are going and maybe we will make another loaf of red and see if there's a significant difference between our first loaf but the bottom line is with this bread we're with this dough and with this method hopefully over time we are creating a sourdough a sourdough starter and one that maybe a little easier than the ones where you've tried just doing flour and water on your counter and hoping for the best we are cheating a little starting off with a little bit of packaged jeast but you know sometimes when you're on this continuum of moving from a process foods kitchen to a traditional foods kitchen and there is a particular area of traditional foods that you're struggling with sometimes it's nice to get a little helping hand and maybe just start with a little bit of package east in our case just a quarter of a teaspoon and then over time hopefully you've got a good sourdough starter going well my oven just came up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit so we'll get ready to put our dough which has been rising for an hour into the oven and hopefully it will come out great now I just want to give you one tip if you're doing it like me right here on a baking pan but you want to try to mimic the Dutch oven effect the the steam that is created by putting your bread into the Dutch oven you can take a little pan and put it on the lowest rack in your oven and oven safe pan and fill it with some water and you've just some water I've got my tea kettle over there just some water that you've warmed a new tea kettle and pour as you open your oven pour it into that pan it'll start to create some steam then put your bread in on your rack close your door and hope for the best well I've got my bread in the oven and it's gonna bake for 30 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit now you might wonder why I just put the bread in straight away as it was I didn't slash the top and the reason is I decided to just let it crack basically wherever it wants to give it the most rustic look that's what my Fred used to do but if you have a LOM that's the little razor blade for cutting bread or just a very sharp knife you can certainly make some slashes in it with any design that you want and let it bake like that and I also want to say that everyone's oven is slightly different so even though technically we're going to bake the bread for 30 minutes I highly recommend taking a little peek at your bread at about 25 minutes and if it looks done if the top is nice and golden brown and you take it out of the oven and when you tap it on the bottom it sounds hollow you're good to go your bread is baked however if you find that it is browning on top but it but it turns out to not sound hollow and you need to bake it a little longer but you feel that it's gotten already golden brown enough and you're worried about it getting too dark on top you can just cover it with a little bit of an aluminum tantalum aluminium foil tent and continue to allow it to bake for the remaining five minutes so that the interior bakes but that the top doesn't get too Brown well this turned out to be a lovely loaf of bread I had it in for 30 minutes now it didn't split or anything which is very interesting and it did have some bubbles on top right on top of the dough and I noticed them when I was putting them in the oven and I was thinking maybe I should just take a little toothpick and deflate some of them but then I forgot it but it turned out okay I think they're gonna be probably kind of little fun and crunchy on the top but something that I want to mention is I did tent this with aluminum foil partway through the baking because I checked it and I noticed and it was those little bubbles they were browning quite quickly but also the loaf was browning relatively quickly now I have a very small oven and I did have it on the lower third rack but it still was browning browning quickly so I might lower the temperature to 425 degrees Fahrenheit or maybe even 400 degrees Fahrenheit I'm going to experiment with the next loaf we do and see how that comes out but for now I'm quite pleased even with having to tent it but I wanted to let you know about that so that if you do this keep an eye on it and if you have a small oven probably in a bigger oven it won't be as much of a problem but I have like the smallest wall oven I think so just keep an eye on it and you don't want to you don't want it to burn on top so you may have to tent it well this is still quite hot but hopefully you can hear with the microphone it's got a nice top to it and oh the bottom sounds nice and Hollow so that's perfect I'm gonna transfer this now to a cooling rack will let it cool completely then will slice it well I let this cool for a little bit but it's still warm I think it's hard to resist warm homemade bread so we'll go ahead and slice into it and I'm gonna go right down the middle and then I'll open it up so we can see exactly how the crumb came well this looks quite lovely it's very warm but I'm quite pleased you figured for 1/4 teaspoon of yeast and in the dough left in the fridge for a couple of days oh it smells nice I'll take some close-up shots so that you can see exactly what it looks like you will see yeah these were the little air bubbles that I talked about that I didn't pop before it went in but yeah that's okay but I think it came quite lovely well I'm gonna cut a slice here and we'll give it tastehh well I really love how soft the interior is hmm mmm it's quite hot it's very tasty I'm really pleased now we've got our second batch of the busy mother sourdough starter in the fridge I'm gonna leave it in there for a couple of days and then we'll take it out and we'll see without having added any extra yeast if that little bit of dough that we left in there and then mixed in more flour and water and sugar and salt was able to rise and get some bubbles in there and then we'll bake one more loaf and we'll see how that comes well I left this second batch in the refrigerator for three days and I'm very impressed with what I see it's definitely risen there's a lot of bubbles in here and all overly pictures close-up pictures so that you can see this both from the front angle here as well as the side angle but it's loaded with bubbles so that's definitely a good sign now I want to see how the aroma is oh it smells wonderful mildly yeasty but definitely not overpowering definitely closer to when you have a nice sourdough as opposed to a heavily yeasted dough where you've used commercial yeast I'm also going to take a picture of the top looking down into this so that you can see up close now I don't I don't know how well it's going to show on the camera but there are a lot of little bubbles on top and they're not super translucent so it may be a little difficult to see but there it's it's very bubbly on top it's like bubbles that are like little air pockets that are coming up now what I'm gonna do today is I'm just gonna flour my board I'm going to take some of that dough out and make another loaf of bread I won't walk you through all of that since we did that earlier in the video but I will show you what the bread looks like at the end and we can compare and contrast at least with pictures from our first bread and then in a future video as I nurse this along and keep it going I'll see how it goes assuming that if it continues to say like this and create nice breads I'll definitely do a follow-up video you know maybe like a month or so from now so that we can do a true evaluation of this process well I took out some of the dough and I shaped a little loaf and I left in maybe about a half a cup a cup it's hard to tell exactly but I took a picture so you can see what's in here and it was really wet it was a really wet dough when I took it out so I floured my board and then I floured my hands real well and I used my bench crepe to get this into some semblance of a loaf but it was relatively easy to work with but it is definitely a very wet shaggy dough but not unlike you know so a lot of your typical no needs so now what we're gonna do is just like we did last time we're going to put three cups of flour in here and I'm still gonna continue to add a bit of sugar so I've got that one tablespoon of sugar I'm gonna sprinkle that in and then one teaspoon of salt and then I'm gonna take about a cup and a half of water and this is just plain room-temperature water then I'm gonna take the handle of my wooden spoon and I'm just gonna mix this up like we did last time well I've got this all mixed up and I even use my bench scrape to try and scrape down a little bit of the dried dough from the side and it's the same consistency as last time I'll overlay a little video so hopefully you can see that but it's just the same wet shaggy dough well now this is all ready to go back into my fridge and on the second batch I had left it in the refrigerator for three days so now on this third batch I may let it go a week and see how it does and see if I can still bake a loaf of bread with it so if someone was a very busy mother and they didn't get to it for a week how would it be that'll be interesting to see so I'm gonna go ahead and put this in the fridge well I've got the dough on my parchment lined baking sheet now I'm gonna let it rise in a warm cozy place then we'll bake it and I'll show you how it looks well I baked up this bread and I've got to tell you I'm really surprised this was the second batch that we took out of the refrigerator that I had left in there from three days ago and we added no more yeast that second time around we just added the flour the sugar and the salt and it's got a pretty good rise now I want to tell you that I preheated my oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and then I went ahead and put the dough in I had it on the lower third of my oven where I like to bake my bread and I forgot to lower it down to 425 because if you remember I told you that it browned up a little too quickly and so for the next time I was going to lower it the experiment and lower it to 425 well I forgot till it was in there for about 10 minutes and what happened was this spot right here definitely got a little over browned this is one of those bubbles and so I quickly lowered my oven to 425 and tented my bread so I just want to give you a heads up on all of this as you're experimenting with this busy mother sourdough monitor it and learn your oven and learn how this bread bakes up in your oven because you may find that it Browns quicker than you expect it to well now let's cut this down the middle and I'll show it to you and then what I'll do is I'll get the picture from the last loaf we made which was the very first loaf and I'll try to put it side-by-side so that you can compare it to how this loaf looks and we'll see what direction we're moving in all righty here we go whoops let's oh my gosh it looks great look at this I'm really impressed well I'll take some close-up pictures and I'll overlay them so that you can see this bread as is and then what I'll do is I'll as I said I'll try to put it side-by-side with our original loaf but when you consider this was baked with dough that had been in the refrigerator for three days and part of it was in for two days so some of that dough was in the refrigerator for a total of five days no extra yeast was added the second time around I think it came pretty darn good well this really turned out to be a lovely bread it's very nice it's tender let's give it a taste now and you know I'm thinking I'm going to experiment and I'm gonna try doing this in a loaf pan I want to try out doing a lot of different things with this maybe making rolls maybe even try cinnamon rolls with this dough I think it might turn out quite well well let's give this a taste mmm very good it's tasty I'm impressed well I look forward to sharing more with you about this busy mother sourdough and if you've been struggling with sourdough starter I really hope you'll give it a try I think you're gonna be pleasantly surprised and if you'd like to learn more about how to bake bread with yeast without yeast maybe with sourdough starter if you're up for that then be sure to click on this video over here where I show you how to make all kinds of different breads and I'll see you over there in my Texas Hill Country kitchen love and God bless", "Re0DptU8lkw": "today i want to share with you how to make five healthy make-ahead mixes to stock your pantry these are all shelf stable and i'm gonna show you how to make a pancake mix a cornbread mix a brownie mix a biscuit mix and number five is an all-purpose baking mix that's a perfect substitute for bisquick sweet friends i'm mary and welcome to mary's nest where i teach traditional cooking skills for making nutrient-dense foods like bone broth ferments sourdough and more so if you enjoy learning about those things consider subscribing to my channel and don't forget to click on the little notification bell below that'll let you know every time i upload a new video well all these healthy make-ahead mixes rely on using some whole grain flour now because we are using some whole grain flour the shelf stability of these mixes is six months if you decide to substitute and use all all-purpose flour some of you may know it as plain flour or white flour or bread flour for that matter then the shelf stability of these would be one year and when i say shelf stable i mean that these can actually go into your main pantry or your extended pantry they do not need to be refrigerated or frozen but if you want to do that you certainly can and that would extend the shelf life now i'm going to go over all the ingredients for each of these make-ahead mixes but don't worry you don't need to write any of this down underneath this video if you open up the description there'll be a link it'll say recipe and there'll be a link next to that and if you click on it it'll take you over to my website and you can read all the ingredients online or you can print it out also in each recipe i will tell you how to take this mix and turn it into what it's intended for so we're going to start with the pancake mix so i'll have the list of ingredients for your make-ahead mix and then i'll also include a recipe for how to turn your make-ahead mix into pancakes or into the cornbread or into the brownies and so on and so forth now i want to let you know these are completely dry mixes you may see some make-ahead mixes that add in the fat and i'm not going to do that because adding in the fat even if it's a relatively shelf-stable fat like a coconut oil or like lard the problem is when you're making a make-ahead mix with whole grains letting them be exposed to the moisture that is in those fats will lower the shelf life so if you go ahead at this point and add in your coconut oil or add in your lard then you're probably going to push the shelf life of these mixes closer to three months versus six months so what i prefer to do is keep them completely dry and then when i get ready to make whatever it is whatever mix i'm using and whatever i'm making with it at that point i like to add in my fat and my liquids now what i'm showing here today for my whole grain flour i'm using whole wheat flour because that's the easiest flour for most of us to find at the grocery store however if you want to upgrade it and use one of the ancient grains like a whole grain spelt flower or a whole grain ein corn flour you can certainly do that also to some of these make-ahead mixes i do add in a little all-purpose flour and that just helps lighten the mixture overall but never feel bad about mixing in a little all-purpose flour with your whole grain flowers because even our ancestors would lighten their whole grain flower by sifting out a little of the bran and the germ so we basically imitate that process by just adding a little all-purpose flour to help lighten our whole grain flour since most of us are buying the whole grain flour from the store we're not grinding it and sifting it so in order to replicate something like what our ancestors did we add in a little all-purpose flour however that said if you have a grain mill and you're grinding your your grain and you're making your whole grain flour you can simply sift out a little bit of the bran and the germ and then you can just proceed from there without adding in any all-purpose flour and i will definitely explain all of that and go through all of that in the written recipe and one other thing i want to mention is if you are not grinding your own grain but you're using an ancient grain maybe a whole grain spelt or a whole grain ein corn and you do want to lighten it a little you can certainly use your all-purpose spelt flour or your all-purpose ein corn flour in place of the traditional all-purpose flour which is a wheat-based flour a modern-day wheat-based flour that's most commonly found at the grocery store well let's start with our make ahead pancake mix what you're going to need is three and a half cups of a whole grain flour as i said i have whole wheat flour 100 whole wheat flour and i'm just using the whole wheat flour you may also see at your grocery store something that's becoming more common now called white whole wheat flour and that's not all-purpose flour that's actually a whole grain flour just from a a slightly different breed of wheat and that does create a slight a slightly lighter baked good but so if you find that you can certainly use that as well but i've just got your traditional 100 whole wheat the common whole wheat from the grocery store three and a half cups and then i've got one cup of all-purpose flour or plain flour next you're going to want two and a half tablespoons of baking powder and the baking powder that i've got here is an aluminum free baking powder and next you're going to need a half a tablespoon of salt and i'm using a fine ground sea salt whatever salt you use you can use the pink himalayan salt you can use the real salt you can even use table salt if that's what you have but you want whatever you use you want to make sure that it's a fine ground salt so that it mixes well and then you need a quarter cup of some type of dry sweetener i'm using sukinat which is simply the dried sugar cane juice so it has all the vitamins and minerals still in it as opposed to white sugar where those vitamins and minerals have been stripped out and if you're not familiar with sukhanat uh it sometimes is sold under that name sukinat which stands for sugarcane natural it's just a little compilation of the letters from those three words and sometimes it'll just be sold under the name dried sugar cane juice that's one option you could use maple sugar you could use date sugar you could use coconut sugar any sugar you like certainly in a pinch if you're still in the transition of transitioning from a processed foods kitchen to a traditional foods kitchen and all you have is white sugar you can still use that at this point and you're just going to need a quarter of a cup now you just want to get a whisk wooden spoon spatula whatever you have and you want to get this really well incorporated so that everything is thoroughly mixed together and just keep twirling it around until you see that sugar blending in that's probably the easiest thing for you to see blend in because it's a little darker color and once you get this all mixed up you just want to transfer it to whatever you want to store it in and i'm going to just store it in a canning jar and this is a half gallon canning jar so i should have plenty of room to get all of this in there once i get this into my jar i like to put in a little silica gel pack and i'll just put that right down in in there and that'll help keep this very dry and those silica gel packs are very helpful especially if you live in a humid climate so that's just a little tip to keep in mind and you can pretty much find those anywhere they're always usually available online at amazon i'll put a link in the description below to the ones that i like but just keep your eyes open sometimes you'll find them at the big box stores or somewhere maybe around the canning area in your grocery store so definitely keep your eyes open but those are great at making sure that your mixtures stay nice and dry but don't worry if you don't have them it's fine they're still going to hold up well now when you're ready to use this you'll mix this with your milk and your eggs and you'll be able to make your pancake batter and i'll have all of the details about that in the written recipe but for now this goes into the pantry and one thing i do want to mention before i put this in the pantry what i like to do is label what this mix is and then i'll often attach the recipe for how to use it so when you're over at my website you can print out the recipe for how to use this in terms of adding the milk and the eggs so on and so forth and you can print it out and then scotch tape it to the jar or right inside your pantry door whatever works best for you but be sure to label your mix so that you don't get mixed up to make our healthy make-ahead cornbread mix what you're going to need is four cups of cornmeal and i've got a stone ground cornmeal here then you're going to want three cups of whole wheat flour and one cup of all-purpose flour to this you're going to add a quarter cup of baking powder and lastly you're going to need two teaspoons of salt now i'm just using a fine ground sea salt you can use any salt you have then just like we did with the pancake mix we're just going to give this a good whisk around until we get everything well mixed together and nicely incorporated once i get this all nicely mixed together i'm going to start transferring it to my jar and i've got another half gallon size canning jar here now i'm going to put in my silica dry pack and these are food safe i just want to let you know that and then i'm going to put my lid on and into my pantry goes the cornbread mix and again just like with the pancake mix in the written recipe i'll have all the instructions on how to turn this into cornbread now we're moving on to our healthy brownie make-ahead mix and the wonderful thing about brownies is they lend themselves beautifully to whole grains and whole sugars and that makes me really happy because if you've ever looked at a brownie recipe they generally call for a lot of sugar actually in comparison to how much flour you're using so if you can use a whole sugar like a soukinet or a coconut sugar or a date sugar or a maple sugar the nice thing is you can help at least bring back some nutrients into the brownies some vitamins and minerals that are in those natural whole sugars or whole sweeteners now what you're going to need for this make-ahead mix is two cups of whole wheat flour and one cup of all-purpose flour now i just want to mention something about using whole wheat flour or any whole grain flour for that matter because sometimes i get this question as to recipes can you use sprouted flour in place of just traditional whole grain flour a whole grain sprouted flour and yes you can for any of these recipes whenever we've called for whole grains you can definitely substitute with a sprouted whole grain flour and if sprouted whole grain flour interests you i'll i have a video all about how to make sprouted flour how to soak the grain how to sprout it how to dry it how to grind it and make your own sprouted flour it's actually easier than it sounds because a lot of it is down time on your part but if that's something you'd like to learn i'll be sure to put a link in the description below to that video but getting back to our mix we've got two cups whole wheat flour one cup all-purpose flour and then we're going to need two teaspoons of baking powder and one teaspoon of salt and just a fine ground i'm using a sea salt like i always do this is a fine ground sea salt but you can use any fine ground salt you have now for this make ahead mix you're going to need four cups of sugar now as i said you look to try to use a nice whole sugar or whole sweetener what i've got here is a dark coconut sugar sometimes you'll see light coconut sugar sometimes you'll see dark coconut sugar if you can find dark coconut sugar that works very well in brownies or any time that you're baking with anything to do with chocolate it gives a richer flavor it's richer in nutrients and the dark color works well given that the nature of what you're baking with chocolate is a dark color now don't worry if you are still as i mentioned earlier on your journey where and maybe you're just starting out at the very beginning of making the transition from a processed foods kitchen to a traditional foods kitchen and you may have started already incorporating whole grains but you've not started incorporating whole sugars or other whole forms of sweeteners don't worry you can use four cups of white sugar for this sometimes it can be helpful to do these things in stages get your palate your family and friends palettes used to baked goods with whole grains and then start moving over to transitioning from white sugar to some of your alternative sweeteners and then last but not least the cocoa powder now what i've got here is an organic cocoa powder from my local grocery store and those of you who are texans will recognize heb it's like the best grocery store on the planet but in any event cocoa powder is often sold in an eight ounce container and you're going to need the full eight ounces to make this make ahead mix but in case you buy cocoa powder in bulk or you just happen to have a larger container eight ounces of cocoa powder is approximately two cups just shy of two cups so uh if you are using something that isn't just in an eight ounce container just measure out about two cups so we're going to go ahead and put in our baking powder and then we're going to go ahead and put in our salt and i'm first going to just give this a little spin around just to get the two flowers well incorporated and the salt and baking powder well incorporated before i add in the cocoa powder now i'm going to go ahead and add in my eight ounces of cocoa powder and now i'm going to incorporate all of this cocoa powder into our mix i like to do this in stages as opposed to the other two mixes that i just mixed everything together in one fell swoop because sometimes there can be little lumps and whatnot in the cocoa powder and this way you can really see what you're doing and get it nicely incorporated with the flour and then i like to add in the sugar last because using this dark coconut sugar it's quite rich and it in it in itself is a little lumpy so i'm going to uh add that in last and then really give it a good mix this smells wonderful if you like chocolate and who doesn't all righty i'm going to get this coconut sugar and i think i'm probably going to switch to a wooden spoon for this and i'm going to start mixing all of that in well i've got that sugar mixed in well and now we'll get ready to bottle it up and i've got another canning jar here a half a gallon size this should all fit in here and i'll just start scooping that in and now my silica gel pack kind of right down the middle there my lid on and now this is ready to go in the pantry and in the written recipe i'll have all the directions about adding the butter and the eggs and so on and so forth to turn this into brownies and i also want to mention in the written recipe i will tell you how many batches of brownies pancakes so on and so forth cornbread that you can get out of these mixes because you're going to use for example to make the brownies about two cups of the brownie mix per batch of brownies so you'll easily get four batches of brownies out of this mix and keep in mind you can double this triple this quadruple this whatever make as many drawers if you want or in larger jars so you can make as much as you think that you'll need over a six-month period well i think everyone loves biscuits the only drawback is they're usually made from all white flour all-purpose flour plain flour and so they're really void of nutrition but what's great about this mix is that i've found the right combination of whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour that still creates a nice biscuit however we bring in some nutrition thanks to the whole wheat flour now i'm just using regular whole wheat flour but if in your travels you come across whole wheat pastry flour which creates even a lighter baked good be sure to try that in this mix so for this healthy biscuit make-ahead mix you're going to need four cups of whole wheat flour and two cups of all-purpose flour next you're going to need some type of dry sweetener and i'm using sukinat but you can definitely use anything else you have the maple sugar the date sugar the coconut sugar whatever you like and if you're at the beginning of your journey from a processed foods kitchen to a traditional foods kitchen and all you have at this point is white sugar you can definitely use that and you're going to need 1 3 cup of the sugar next you're going to want a quarter of a cup of baking powder and then one teaspoon of a fine soil to fine ground salt i'm just using a fine ground sea salt again like with all the others use whatever you have on hand so i'm gonna go ahead and mix in this baking powder and this salt and then i'm just going to give this all a good twizzle around to completely incorporate then i'm going to add in the sugar sometimes sukinat like some of your other whole sweeteners can be a little on the chunky side so what i'm going to do is just make sure i get all of this incorporated first and then i'm going to add the sugar you can add it through like a mesh strainer i'm just going to break up it's such a small amount that i'm just going to break up any little lumps with my hands this isn't too lumpy just a few little lumps in there alrighty now i'm going to go ahead and add in that sugar and i'm going to go ahead and mix that in now and now we'll go ahead and decant this one up as well and something i want to mention to you about these half gallon jars these work very well for these mixes because technically yes they hold eight cups however the eight cup mark is right here so if you're making one of these mixes like we did with the brownie mix and you're actually closer to nine cups of total ingredients that's okay because you can come right up to here you still have plenty of room so these work very well and then goes my silica gel pack now lid on ready for my pantry and in the written recipe i'll tell you exactly how to use this mix to make some wonderfully delicious homemade biscuits well if you just want to make one healthy make-ahead mix this is the mix for you this is an all-purpose baking mix it's very similar to bisquick but this is a healthy version if you're new to the idea of bisquick or an all-purpose baking mix it is exactly as the name implies you can use it to bake a lot of things you can use it to make pancakes of course and you can use it to make waffles but you can also use it to make muffins and coffee cakes and quick breads there's so much that you can do with an all-purpose baking mix and in the written recipe i'll definitely i'll include some ideas for what you can make with this to begin with you're going to need five cups of whole wheat flour and then you're going to need one cup of all-purpose flour to this you want to add three and a half tablespoons of baking powder and you're going to need one tablespoon of salt and this is just a fine ground sea salt but again as i've said before use whatever you have next you're going to need one cup of powdered milk and this is a non-fat powdered milk and i'm using non-fat powdered milk because that helps extend the shelf life of this mix you can also use a whole milk powdered milk but because that has the fat in it and even though it's dried it still is a fat it doesn't have the same shelf life as the non-fat powdered milk so rather than this having a shelf life of about six months you'd push it back to maybe only about three months so i recommend in these make make-ahead mixes using non-fat powdered milk so we'll get our non-fat powdered milk in the mix and before i add the sugar i'm just going to give this all a mix because i am using a whole sugar and that can sometimes be a little lumpy so you can put that through a mesh strainer or this is such a small amount that we're going to be adding to this we can just break up any lumps like we did before with our hands next you're going to need a quarter cup of some type of dried sweetener and for this i find sukinat works very well but again like with the others you can use date sugar maple sugar coconut sugar you know whatever you have and if you're like i've said in the past at the beginning of your traditional foods journey you can certainly uh use white sugar and you just need a quarter of a cup now we'll just give this a good whisk around to incorporate all that sugar not all that sugar we're lucky it's only a quarter of a cup of sugar i've got this all jarred up i'm going to put in my food safe silica gel pack and that's ready for the pantry now if you would like to learn how to make more homemade mixes like a homemade cream of soup mix spice mixes homemade salad dressings how to make your own bouillon powder all sorts of things be sure to click on this playlist over here and i'll see you over there in my texas hill country kitchen love and god bless", "OfDIXH2sEPc": "[Music] and welcome back to love your food with those holidays coming up we have a really great recipe for you this is ginger molasses cookies now this has recently been repopulate offi chain but they are absolutely delicious and they are dead simple a little bit of customization available with this one but let's start with our basic ingredients so we've got some brown sugar obviously we have our molasses here we have one egg we have some baking soda and some baking powder we have a little bit of salt this is some grated ginger and some ground cinnamon of course we have our flour we have a little bit of plain white sugar this is just for rolling the cookies in before we bake them obviously we're gonna need some butter in there as well and we have a little addition of some crystallized candied ginger and this is optional we add it because it makes it an amazing flavor so we're gonna start with our dry ingredients so we're gonna get everything in together here with our flour we're adding the baking soda baking powder our spices of course all of the amounts are going to be in the recipe below so please do check the description for all of our recipe amounts down there so you want to give this a good stir and make sure that everything is well combined you don't want any pockets of the spices or anything like that you want to make sure everything is well blended in there now we're not adding the salt to the dry ingredients the reason is if we add it to the butter and molasses mixture it actually dissolves a little bit better and you get a little bit more thorough distribution of the salt through the cookie dough when it's made so once that's well blended we're going to move on to our wet ingredients so here's our salt here's our brown sugar in with the butter and we're gonna bring that over to our mixer now you can do this by hand we're digging a little shortcut here we're using the paddle on our mixer and we're just gonna give that a low-speed blend so once everything's in there and you're plugged in you want to get that going and we're gonna cream thoroughly cream together the butter and brown sugar with the salt we were hoping that would get the butter off the paddle there but it didn't so don't be afraid to get in there with a spatula and clear it off so that it works a little bit better and there we go so once again let's get that started and then we're going to keep going until it's nice and smooth like this well and thoroughly creamed together you want to make sure there's no pockets of butter or anything you want to give it a good stir stir it up so that the bottom gets mixed into the top and make sure there's no just like big chunks of butter hiding anywhere you want everything really well distributed through your cookie dough so once that is done we're going to add our molasses there we go so that is all of our molasses in there don't worry if it gets everywhere on the paddle and on the sides it's all gonna get mixed in it's no big deal and then from there we're going to add the egg as well once we got everything off of our spatula yeah there we go and then back in with the paddle and we're gonna make that all blended together again now this is gonna make a pretty wet batter but you do want to make sure that everything is well combined at this point before we get the dry ingredients in so this is our crystallized candied ginger we happen to have some of this on hand if you do have some of this it's I can't recommend it off it makes this really amazing gingery aroma in your cookie you get these beautiful little bursts of bright gingery flavor when you're biting into them it's absolutely delicious and it's just chop it really fine little dice and this will be a great addition if you have this on hand you can see chef caleb here is just giving it a nice fine chop and we're gonna add that when we add our dry ingredients there you can see about how how big we want that so there we go so now we have this all together here you see it's quite a loose batter this is all of our wet ingredients it's the butter the brown sugar the molasses the egg and the salt along with nothing else honestly yet so you just want to make sure that there are again are no little pockets of molasses or anything you want to make sure you give it a little scoop underneath make sure that everything's stirred up so there's no bits remaining anywhere so we're gonna add our dry ingredients now a lot of recipes will ask you to add like a quarter of them or a third of them and then mix things up and then go back we're gonna sidestep that we're gonna add it all together at once and what we're going to do is we're going to just pulse it at first instead of starting to mix it right away so just give it a little blend just a few little pulses to get things started so this is going to really slowly work everything together at the at the beginning and you can see it's sort of coming together there and then once you get sort of started there we're going to is just and get it going on a low speed and then we're gonna add our diced ginger and there we go so now we're getting everything blended together this is our final cookie dough blending here we're just gonna make sure that everything gets nicely blended together you don't want to overwork this because it will make your cookies a little tough you just want to mix it until it's well well blended everything is homogeneous you don't want again you're gonna mix it up on the bottom you want to give a good scrape down the sides of your bowl and along the bottom to make sure there's no pockets of any of your ingredients and then give it a little blend make sure that we're going only as far as everything well combined so once we're there and all this left to do now is we're going to make sure we get all of that off the paddle and off our scraper and we're going to start making these into cookies so unlike like a sugar cookie or anything like that where you'd normally be rolling this out as a dough this is more of a batter so we're just gonna be taking small balls of it rolling them into actual balls and you can make these whatever size you like but it will affect cooking time and then we're just gonna roll them in sugar and that gives it that really nice crystal sugar texture on the outside so just make sure they've got a nice little coating of the sugar on the outside and then you're gonna place them on either a Silpat or parchment lined baking tray and do give them a little bit of room because they are gonna spread out it's a lot of butter a lot of sugar in there and they are going to definitely flatten out into broader cookies once they've baked so that's gonna go into your preheated oven so we have that going at 375 and we're just going to start that at 10 minutes so after 10 minutes this is what they're looking like but they're not quite done yet so we're gonna give them another couple of minutes here literally just a couple so 2 more minutes in there if you cook them a little bit longer they come out quite crispy so they're more like a gingersnap which is fine for most people we do honestly like them a little bit chewy so we tend to cook them a little less and there you go they are done so they have that really nice crack texture on the top a little bit of the really nice crystal sugar texture on the outside as well once they've cooled a little bit but they're still pliable you can take them off the parchment or the Silpat and get them onto a cooling rack so they can cool a little faster a little airflow on both sides and that's it you are delicious they're really excellent around the holidays they're nicely spiced ginger and cinnamon the candied ginger of course a hundred percent optional but really makes a beautiful delicious flavor in there and that's really it so if you

[Music]", "G1Z5HTj_vO0": "today i want to share with you a healthy molasses cookies recipe these are soft and chewy and most important delicious [Music] hi sweet friends i'm mary and welcome to mary's nest where i teach traditional cooking skills for making nutrient-dense foods like bone broth ferment sourdough and more so if you enjoy learning about those things consider subscribing to my channel and don't forget to click on the little notification bell below that'll let you know every time i upload a new video well the nice thing about molasses cookies is that they lend themselves beautifully to being made with whole grain flours as opposed to all-purpose flour so for this recipe today i'm going to use whole wheat flour because that's easy to find at most local grocery stores but if you've already started incorporating some of the ancient grain flowers into your traditional foods kitchen like ein corn flour or like spelt flour you can definitely use those in this recipe and if you've started incorporating sprouted flours into your baking you can definitely use sprouted flour here and if you want to learn how to make homemade sprouted flour i have a video where i show you how to do that and i'll be sure to link to that in the description below now you don't need to write any of this down if you open the description under this video i'll have a link that'll say recipe and if you click on that it'll take you over to the printable recipe now to my whole wheat flour my two cups of whole wheat flour i'm going to add one teaspoon of ground cinnamon one teaspoon of ground cloves and one teaspoon of ground ginger now these are sort of traditional for making molasses cookies now i'm also going to add one teaspoon of ground allspice now you do not need to add this if you don't want i like the taste that the allspice adds to the molasses cookies so i'm going to go ahead and add that in you're also going to need 1 teaspoon of baking soda and a half a teaspoon of salt and all i've got here is a fine ground sea salt but use whatever salt you have next you're going to need one stick of butter and one stick of butter is a half a cup of butter now if you want to keep these dairy free you can certainly substitute the butter for coconut oil coconut oil actually works very well in this recipe and you'd want to use a half a cup of coconut oil now let's talk about the options for sweetening these cookies now i'm going to use honey because many of you have told me that you've had trouble finding sukinat which is the dried sugarcane juice it stands for sugarcane natural sukinat you've had trouble finding that at your grocery store and i understand completely my grocery store does carry it but they sell out very quickly so it's often not on the shelf and so you've asked what are some other options now if you're at the very beginning of your journey moving from a processed foods kitchen to a traditional foods kitchen and all maybe you have in your pantry might be a light brown sugar or a dark brown sugar you can definitely use that in this recipe or if you have sukinat you can definitely use that but if you use any of those dry sugars you're going to want to use one cup and i'll have this all spelled out in the written recipe but if you can ha if you can use honey if you've got honey and honey is usually easy to find and you want a nice pourable honey all you're going to need is three quarters of a cup now in terms of other dry sweeteners in addition to if you're using the light brown sugar or the dark brown sugar or if you've moved a little closer to your traditional foods kitchen and you do have sukinat you can also use other dried sugars and you'd use the one cup like maple sugar or coconut sugar or a date sugar all of those work very well in this recipe next you're going to need two eggs and we're going to beat these before we add them in but you will need two eggs and then you're going to need one teaspoon of vanilla extract and any vanilla extract you have is fine this is a homemade version but if you have the store-bought that's fine too but if you want to learn how to make homemade extract i'll be sure to link to the video where i show you how to do that in the description below and then the star of the show the molasses you're going to need a quarter cup of molasses and this recipe is very flexible if you have just the regular unsulfured molasses which is what i'm using here that's fine and if you have the blackstrap molasses you can use that as well that has a little bit of a stronger flavor so uh if you're you know maybe at the beginning of your traditional foods journey and you're introducing uh molasses to yourself your own palate or your family or your friends uh just starting with the unsulfured the plain on sulfur molasses works very well here well the first thing that we're going to do is i've got a little mesh strainer here i find this works very well just in the event any of the spices or the baking soda or the salt if anything has clumps this is a good way to just kind of sift everything into your bowl and i'm just going to go ahead and add in the baking soda and i'm going to go ahead and add in the salt and all of the spices then i'm just going to shake this all out into my bowl and if towards the end there are any lumps i'll just smooth them out and then we'll proceed on to the next step now we're going to go ahead and put our dry ingredients aside and we're going to move on to creaming the butter and we're going to cream the butter with the honey and with the molasses until it's nice and light and fluffy and this works best if your butter is soft at room temperature and nice and soft now you can do this by hand if you want or you can use a handheld electric mixer which is what i'm going to do or if you have one of those stand mixers you can certainly do that as well but i like to just sort of reserve that when i have a big job because i find it a little more challenging to clean but if you are using the one of those stand mixers you'll just use your paddle attachment for this now if you're using brown sugar or sukinate or one of the other dry sugars you would add that at this time and just in place of the honey now using the electric handheld mixer this is going to take about two to three minutes to do and it'd be about the same using the paddle attachment on your stand mixer and if you're doing it by hand it's just going to take a little bit a little bit longer but you can do it with a wooden spoon and you'll get a little a little workout well that took about three minutes and everything is nice and light and creamy so now i'm going to go ahead and add in my first egg and we'll go and uh beat that until it's fully incorporated and now we'll go and add in our second egg and we'll beat that again and heat it again beat it well into this batter and with each addition of each egg i'm beating it for about 30 seconds and now i'm just gonna go ahead and add in that teaspoon of vanilla and this sort of like the um allspice is a little bit optional but i really like to add vanilla almost to any cookies that i make so i'm going to go ahead now and just beat in this vanilla now at this point what we're going to do is start adding in our dry ingredients to our wet ingredients and this we just do by hand i mean you can do this with your mixer but be careful you don't want to over mix so i really like to just switch at this point to my spatula and just start incorporating the flour mixture into the butter and egg and molasses honey mixture now i'm going to go ahead and just add in the last of my flour and incorporate that into our batter this smells i have to tell you this smells so wonderful it's all those aromas that you associate with the fall so these are a perfect dessert for thanksgiving or christmas you know to have on your dessert table or just to enjoy with a cup of tea i was telling my husband i can't wait till these are ready because i'm looking forward to enjoying one with a cup of tea this is just to me like the perfect fall afternoon treat now you're done mixing once you don't see any more white streaks of flour you've incorporated all of the flour and you have this wonderful richly colored batter you're done and we're ready for the next step now all i'm going to do is clean off my spatula because this is a very wet sticky dough and we're going to actually have to chill this for a bit before we can turn it into cookies and i have to tell you that these molasses cookies were actually a viewer request i have a very sweet friend a very lovely viewer and his name is gary and he said mary can you make molasses cookies because i would like to make molasses cookies for my father and that just really touched my heart let me say hello gary i hope you're doing well and i hope you and your dad will enjoy these cookies now what we're gonna do is cover our bowl with some plastic wrap and we're gonna put this in the refrigerator for at least two hours we need this to firm up so that we can form it into little cookie bowls basically to put on our baking sheet but you can also let this chill overnight but at least two hours you might need a little longer you'll know because you want it to be firm enough that you can handle it well i actually wound up leaving this in my refrigerator overnight so it's chilled beautifully the batter is nice and firm and it's going to be much easier to work with now now what you want to do is get a teaspoon and scoop out about a teaspoon's worth of the dough and then you're going to take it off the teaspoon and you're going to roll it around in your hands to the point where you get a nice ball that's about you you're looking for a ball that's about one inch in size and just keep rolling it around in your hands till it gets nice and smooth and once it's nice and smooth and you've got a nice round ball we're ready to move on to the next step now at this point you have a couple of options what i like to do is to roll the little ball of cookie dough in turbinado sugar and turbinado sugar is a very coarse ground form of sugar that's in the brown sugar family and i'll show you a close-up picture so you can see exactly what it looks like something similar to turbinado might be labeled demerara if i'm pronouncing it correctly that's also a very coarse ground somewhat you know in terms of it's on the continuum of unrefined sugars it's not as unrefined as say a soukinat which is the dried sugar cane juice but it's less refined than white sugar and it gives these cookies a really nice crunch that are often associated with molasses cookies they're soft and chewy and then they have this nice little crunch of the coarse sugar traditional ones may be just rolled in of course white sugar or even just a regular white sugar but i really like to use the turbinado and this is pretty easy to find at most grocery stores now what i'm going to do is take the little bowl that i rolled of the dough and i'm just going to plop it down here into the turbinado sugar and roll it all around to get it completely covered and once it's completely covered with the sugar we're gonna go ahead and put it on on our baking sheet then we'll move on and get ready to do our next one now i've rolled my second ball of dough in the turbinado sugar and i'm going to place this on my baking sheet and this is a parchment-lined baking sheet it just keeps things neater and easier for clean up but if you don't have parchment paper you'll just want to grease your baking sheet but then when you get ready to put your next ball of dough down you're going to want to place that about two inches away from your original dough ball and while you're going through this process you want to make sure that you go ahead and preheat your oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit once you get a total of 12 balls of the cookie dough on your baking sheet spaced about 2 inches apart you want to go ahead and get a glass and you want to flatten down each ball until it's about maybe about a quarter of an inch flat or so and if you find that as you do this it's sticking a little bit to your glass you can just put a little water on your glass and that'll solve the problem once you get all your cookie dough balls flattened we're going to go ahead now and put these into our preheated oven and we're going to bake them for between 8 to 10 minutes you know everybody's oven is slightly different but you'll know that they're done when they start to crack on top well i checked on these at eight minutes and they looked perfect they had started to crack on top as you can see in all of them i'll overlay a close-up picture so that you can see this nice and close up so you'll know exactly what you're looking for now at this stage when you check on them at eight minutes and they've already started to crack and you take them out they're going to create a nice soft and chewy molasses cookie if you like something that has a little bit more crispness to them then you'll want to let them go for the 9 or 10 minutes but watch them carefully because you probably want to check them at nine minutes because cookies cook very fast and they can also burn very quickly so you want to be careful with that but at eight minutes these have cracked on top they look beautiful so i took them out now what i'm going to do is i'm just going to give them a minute or two to cool just to kind of settle a little bit on the baking sheet and then i'm going to get my spatula and we'll transfer some to the cooling rack and we want to let them cool completely well these have cooled a bit on the cooling rack and so they're still a little warm but i figure we got to take a taste well let me break one open and we'll see oh see it's got some nice ply to it this is definitely a wonderful chewy and moist cookie and the aroma oh it's heavenly this is you certainly can make this any time of year but it really has that holiday time aroma i think it's going to be delicious so let's give it a taste oh that's so good you get all the flavors coming through all of the spices and that little bit of crunch of the turbinado sugar or any other sugar that you want to put on on the outside really gives it a nice crunch on the outside oh it's just delightful i really hope you'll give these a try now if you would like more whole grain baked goods be sure to click on this video over here i've got a whole grain recipe for cowboy cookies and i've got an iron corn cake and all kinds of

krenn nourish your body and your soul with dalstrong so hello again everybody i hope you guys are all doing well i've got a great recipe for you here for most of you it's still really cold out there we're actually in north carolina and it's warm today so but i'm making this cookie this cookie recipe as a request from our membership community it's ginger molasses cookies and these are just so packed with intense flavor and they're great especially when it's cold outside and ginger is just the perfect thing to go during these seasons when you're trying not to get the cold or the sniffles so we're going to jump right in so these are also gluten-free oil-free and refined sugar-free which is wonderful so the first thing we're going to start with are our rolled oats these are organic rolled oats two cups worth and we're going to make it into flour but when we make it into flour we're not going to grind it super super fine we're just going to grind it lightly it's still going to be a little bit grainy because when you over grant over grind the oat flour if you make it too fine it really has up it struggles to cook all the way through in the oven so we're just gonna lightly grind so on my blender that's about 20 seconds and it's probably a pretty like medium high speed so if you can see it's not super fine it doesn't look like like whole wheat or white flour it still feels kind of grainy so i'm going to pop that in a bowl we're just going to set this aside for a second because we're going to use that again for our wet ingredients okay and if you want the complete recipe it will be in a link in the details below here we have a half a cup of arrowroot powder and if you don't have arrowroot powder tapioca starch would work also then we have a half a teaspoon of baking soda teaspoon of baking powder two tablespoons of flax meal and that is in place of the egg which would have been there but we don't you don't even need to make a flax egg first because when it gets all mixed together that flax meal is going to soak up all of that moisture that comes from the wet ingredients while it's being mixed together so you don't have to do that first and then we have one teaspoon of ground ginger dried ginger okay so that's all of our dry ingredients so we're just gonna give it a little bit of a stir make sure they're mixed up pretty well so this is a chewy cookie and i used to love my grandma used to buy these i think it's arrow arrow arrow mills cookies they're in these red little flat red uh package and they made the best arrowhead mills i think that's what it was the best molasses cookies and they had the most strong molasses flavor i just oh they're so delicious and ever since then i've been trying to recreate that recipe and it isn't until now that i think i've i've come really close they don't look the same because there's no oil so you don't get that really dark brown molasses color because that's what the oil does you know it makes things get brown but it's going to taste amazing here we have a cup and a half of pitted dates and just a tip on your dates even though oops where i just saw one even though it says pitted on that package sometimes there's still a little bit of that stem piece in there that's really hard and sometimes there's even pits so you have to take each date either squeeze it apart or just squeeze it you can feel if there's a pit in there or not because that is the worst thing when you put it in your blender you get everything mixed together and you hear that clanking of that pit in there and here we have a tablespoon of chopped ginger you can grate it really fine that's what's going to give you a really good punch of ginger flavor that fresh ginger and you do want to chop it pretty small unless you don't mind you know every once in a while getting a little chunk of ginger it's kind of exciting right and three quarters of a cup of unsweetened plant milk this happens to be soy milk that's just what we like here but you can use whatever plant milk you like just make sure it's unsweetened if you're going for that you know no refined sugars because all that sweetness is going to come from from your dates then we're going to put in our molasses so this is this is blackstrap molasses and uh just a little word on molasses i know some people think well that is what's the difference between that sugar actually dr greger has a really good video where he goes through and explains all of the different sugars sweeteners natural sweeteners and which ones are best but ultimately what he came to were dates and blackstrap molasses this is the strongest molasses there's different grades of molasses and this is the strongest you don't really need to use very much because it's not super sweet it's just that really strong molasses flavor so we're going to use two tablespoons and it is really delicious i love the flavor of this i've actually been tempted to put a little bit of it in my coffee in the morning just to see what kind of flavor that would make just a teeny bit just to give it a because i don't like to put sugar in my coffee but every once in a while it's nice to have just a teeny bit of sweetness so i think i'm going to try that okay there we go all right now we're just going to blend this all together until those dates are completely pulverized you want to make this into really like a paste so it might take a little bit of effort you might have to get your your blender out you know and scrape down the sides a little bit but that's okay [Applause] okay let's check and see how that did looks pretty good but there's still a few little date chunks in there that look a little bit too big so i'm going to scrape down the sides and then we're just going to stick it right back in blend it for one more round while we're waiting for that i'd like to share with you some background on our show the whole food plant-based cooking show is crowd-funded which means these

and become a supporting member today by following the link in the description okay let's get back to the show okay there we go oh if you can only smell that wow that molasses just smells so so delicious all right so now we're just going to pour that into our wet ingredients and i've got my oven preheating to 350 degrees fahrenheit and you'll also want to get yourself a cookie sheet ready or a baking tray lined with i like to line mine with parchment paper just so it's much easier to clean up nothing sticks to that stuff okay get all of that goodness out of there don't want to miss a drop okay all right then you just mixed it together really well and it's really this is a really really sticky sticky mixture so it takes a little bit of effort to keep get all that mixed together okay that looks pretty good okay now this next part it's a little bit messy so if you have any little ones they'll love this part but if it's just you you're gonna get sticky so i've got my cookie tray over here and i've got a container of water here and that is so when you're rolling out the balls and your hands get really really sticky or when you're pressing them down you just have to put a little bit more water on your hands and that will come right off so we're just going to set this over here and i just use a spoon and this is completely up to you how big you want to make these cookies let's see i'm gonna put a little water first on hands i like to make them about like golf ball size and you just lightly roll them and put them on your sheet so that's what i'm going to be doing here for a little bit [Music] okay now you've got them all rolled out here and now you need to squish them down because just like uh like regular cookies you know how when they go in the oven and it's really warm and they just you know they flatten out and they ooze out but that's because of the oil so when you make whole food type of cookies there's no oil in it so they're not going to squish out and flatten out like that so you have to really have to press them down and i just put a little bit more water on my hands and i just spread press them down lightly so this looks like only see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifties so this made sixteen cookies so that's probably you know they're about this size so now we just need to get them into the oven and we're going to let them bake for 15 minutes and then we'll check them but that should be just enough time to keep them really nice and chewy and moist okay guys they are out of the oven so 15 minutes was just right they're still like soft and squishy you can feel it but they're done so if you want to come in and take a closer look oh boy i cannot wait to dig into these so i'll grab a cup of soy milk and i'll meet you the table for a taste yip yippee time for a taste so look at this [Music] that is amazing really soft chewy and so delicious you can really taste the ginger and that molasses cookie or molasses just and just slightly sweet perfect for dipping man i can't wait for you guys to try these so give this a like and i'll see you next time [Music]", "4XfYBAfiI5c": "what I'm making for dessert is my ultimate ginger cooking they're filled with spice they're moist they're delicious and who doesn't like cookies so the first thing I need is flour I need two and a quarter cups of flour it was just lighting it with a cup and just level it off without tamping it down and I'm gonna do this all in a sifter so we sift all of these ingredients together all the flour spices two and a quarter perfect one teaspoon of baking soda and next spices first two teaspoons of cinnamon I use really good cinnamon one and a half of close that's a lot of close they're really spicy I know people think ginger cookies only have ginger in them but I love when there are multiple flavors and it just sort of hits you different ways half a teaspoon of ground ginger and half a teaspoon of nutmeg and the key is the balance so that one spice just doesn't stand out it sort of hits you layer after layer after layer quarter of a teaspoon of salt just make everything taste better I know it sounds ought to put salt and sweet things but you put them in savory things to bring out the flavors and you put them in sweet things for exactly the same reason and then just put it through the sifter this is what the sifter is about it actually mixes it but if there are any little sort of pieces and the spices or the flour it takes it out okay that's the dry ingredients now for the wet ingredients so the first thing I need is a cup of brown sugar all of these ingredients add to the moistness and the spiciness of these cookies quarter of a cup of oil use any kind of flavorless oil that you have third of a cup of molasses molasses is actually the concentrated juice of sugarcane so it's very sweet and very flavorful you want to choose unsubbed molasses it's the best quality that's good I'm just going to piece together for a minute while I get the egg ready I want the sugar in the oil to be light and fluffy okay next to the egg got one egg okay that's ready I'm just gonna put the egg in I'm gonna lower the speed I put all the dry ingredients slowly just to make sure they get combined well that's mixed perfectly and now for the surprise crystallized ginger I love crystallized ginger there's something about the heat and the sweetness of it that it's just fantastic so I'm gonna do one and a quarter of cups of chopped crystallized ginger okay right into the mixture give it a little stir and that's done now I'm just going to scoop it out and roll it in sugar and bake it it's gonna be so delicious I [Music] usually use for cookies I use this ice cream scoop it ensures that they're all the same size roll it in my hands and then roll it in the sugar and what this does is make a nice crinkly crust on it and it makes the whole cookie Sparkle so right on the pan just flatten it out with your hand this is the neat great dessert into the oven 350 degrees for 12 minutes and we're gonna have the most delicious ultimate ginger cookies for dinner [Music] the ultimate ginger cookies [Music] you", "4kkx2aX8oqE": "[Music] [Music] hi guys welcome back to another video today I'm gonna show you how I made these delicious gluten free vegan sorghum

amazing let's give them a taste test Oh mmm crunchy on the bottom soft in the middle very lightly sweet with a little sugar coating on the top which adds to the experience they're really good if you like super spicy or like very strong flavorful cookies kind of like ginger cookies I would add an extra half a teaspoon of ginger or an extra half a teaspoon of cinnamon whichever you like better or maybe 1/4 a teaspoon of each spice extra just to make them a little more if you like more spicy cookie but these are really good on their own you're delicious you guys should definitely give them a

catch you in the next video bye", "Jaw5JFWbucQ": "[Music] double ginger molasses cookies because of the spices and the cookie kind of says holiday you really have something to bite into and you get a really nice soft texture in the center [Music] I'm excited about these cookies I love them they're perfect for the holidays but I make them year-round because the flavors are so great I'm going to start with all-purpose flour and I've sifted the cocoa powder over the flour cocoa powder confectioner sugar they really should be sifted or whisked really well before they going I'm putting espresso powder and because I love that deep under flavor that mixes with the spices and the spices are ginger a teaspoon and a half and that's only one of the gingers in the title so this smells good even before you start mixing cinnamon teaspoon and a quarter teaspoon of ground clove close a tough spice it adds amazing flavor which is something pumpkin pie spice cookies but you have to use it intensely tiny measures because it goes from being a pan mysterious and wonderful to medicinal so just a little clove and baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon and just whisk the ingredients together did I forget anything just want to make sure of the salt pepper so I got this recipe from a friend of mine Kristina Beck I loved it as soon as I got it I made it just the way she did I loved it so much that I just want any more of it so I pumped it up just a little bit added the coffee the espresso added something else which you'll see and then made a thicker cookie so you'll really be able to taste it room-temperature butter and brown sugar and confectioner sugar no I'm not confectioner sugar granulated sugar sorry and blend on low fish speed we're using just the yolk for this recipe [Music] a molasses another really strong flavor sure vanilla extract no fake stuff she's spooning [Music] left the way of marvel as it goes [Music] now for the dry going in all at once the spices smell good and just I'm gonna take my chances I'm not going to cover the ball I'm going to cover the ball a very quick mix because we're adding chunky things I've got chopped dark chocolate this cookie would also be good with milk chocolate I'm using bittersweet and this is crystallized or candied ginger you could also if you don't have this take fresh ginger chop it very finely and put it in a little sugar let it sit for about 5 minutes and it will soften and you'll also get a sugar syrup which you can just add to the bowl want the dust also all of that chocolate goes in and then you just give it a last mix to blend that's it it's a very soft dough as you can see you could use it now but it's much better if you chill it refrigerate it for about two hours if you have time and you can let it rest in the refrigerator overnight it will be even better this is true really just about anything with spice if you let it rest a little bit then the spices really come into their own this dough has refrigerated for a bunch of hours and you could choose a tablespoon to portion the dough but this is a medium sized cookie scoop scoop of dough in a ball dipped in sugar I'm going to be baking these in a muffin tin so that they will have a beautiful round shape and they'll be thick look for a jar or a glass that just about fits the bottom of the muffin tin press the cookie down just until it almost reaches the sides of the muffin tins don't worry about the ragged edges the heat is the magician it will make everything better ready for the oven [Music] [Music]", "ky-dG0ds5Fw": "[Music] my friends welcome to my channel if you're new here my name is ELISA and today I'm going to show you how to make chewy molasses cookies just in time for the holiday season these cookies are so simple to make they're super healthy of course they're also vegan and gluten free and they are also paleo they also have the best texture they're crispy on the outside chewy on the inside just as a molasses cookie should be you guys are going to love them I'm bringing you today's video in partnership with my friends at simply organic I use three of their products in today's video but of course you guys know if you've watched any of my previous videos that I love all of their spice ranges this video is also part of their cook for a change campaign you want to learn more about that campaign I encourage you to stay tuned to the end of the video because I will talk a little bit more about that and I'm also going to share how you can enter to win a giveaway I am giving away my 10 essential spices to one lucky winner so make sure to stay tuned to the end of the video and you can learn all about how you can enter and win now of course I'm sure you're dying to just dive into this cookie recipe so let's go ahead and get started so the first thing we're gonna do for these cookies is make a flax egg which is just one tablespoon of flax seed meal plus three tablespoons of water we whisk it together and then set it aside for about five minutes to let it gel while the egg is gelling up we are gonna add half a cup of almond butter into a bowl followed by 1/3 cup of coconut sugar than the flaxseed egg two tablespoons of molasses and then we're using some of simply organics vanilla extract to add a nice pop of flavor then using an electric mixer just beat this all together until it is nice and smooth and creamy [Music] from there we're gonna add in our spices we are using 1 teaspoon of simply organic ginger powder as well as their allspice which really helps to round out the flavor we're gonna use a quarter teaspoon of that as well as a quarter teaspoon of sea salt a quarter teaspoon of baking soda and three tablespoons of coconut flour and again we're going in with our electric mixer and beating this together until it forms a smooth sticky batter from there we will use a cookie scoop or a small ice cream scoop to scoop out the batter and then drop the batter onto a parchment lined baking sheet and repeat until you've used all the dough and then I like to use my fingers to just gently flatten them down and this just helps them spread more evenly so you can do this or if you like puffy cookies you can leave them as is and then I like to also sprinkle them with a little bit of raw turbinado sugar this adds a really nice touch and a little bit of extra sweetness then we will bake these cookies at 350 degrees for 11 to 12 minutes until they are nice and golden brown and you're gonna want to let them cool on the pan for about 10 minutes then you can transfer them to a wire rack and make sure you let them cool completely before you dive in this ensures that they have that nice crispy exterior and nice soft chewy interior once your cookies are cool you can dive in and enjoy them and I also wanted to mention that these make a really nice holiday gift so I just wanted to show you how I package them up I use little cellophane bags that I bought on Amazon and I just basically stack up 6 to 10 cookies and then I tie them off with the little twist tie that they come with and then I have these cute little tags and I just tie them on and it makes a really cute

new tutorial on bread baking canning and other simple living projects today i am doing something a little bit different and i want to share one of my very favorite christmas cookie recipes this is old-fashioned molasses cookies and what i wouldn't do is between now and christmas share with you guys on some of our favorite holiday recipes especially christmas cookies and this is our absolute favorite so it is really when you look at it it just seems like a basic molasses cookie but it's probably the recipe that in real life i get asked about the most everyone who tries these wants this recipe and when you make them i think you will see why so you'll notice that i use crisco for this which is not something that i usually ever cook with but for these cookies it really makes a difference in making them extra chewy and having them keep their softness and chewiness for a couple days which is really just great so i know crisco is not the healthiest ingredient but it really is worth it here for this recipe we're going to need three quarters of a cup of crisco or any other vegetable shortening a cup of plain white granulated sugar one egg a quarter cup of molasses i recommend that you get not black strap and not the robust flavor just the regular molasses two cups of regular flour a teaspoon of baking soda a teaspoon of baking powder a quarter teaspoon of salt and then we're going to add a lot of christmas spices so i do a heaping teaspoon of ground ginger a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon three quarters of a teaspoon of allspice half a teaspoon of cloves and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg this is a little bit higher in spice than some of the molasses cookie recipes out there but i think this is what gives them that plus the crisco is what makes them extra special we're also going to roll these in sparkling sugar which you can sometimes find at the grocery store with like the cake decorating supplies but it's actually much less expensive to just buy a big bag of it online and i will link for you where i get it i just get it from amazon and it's a pretty good deal when you buy just a pound of it so um the first thing we're going to do is beat together the shortening and the sugar until it is light and fluffy it will change texture keep beating until you see that texture change this is going to take about three to four minutes at medium speed and you can do these in a stand mixer or just your hammocks they're just going to work fine too and after that we're going to go ahead and add the egg and then the molasses at the same time and beat them together and one tip if you don't like dealing with that sticky molasses measuring cup just spray it really quick with pam beforehand [Music] now in a separate bowl we're going to mix together our dry ingredients so this is going to be our flour salt baking soda baking powder and all of our spices just briefly mix those together and then we need to add that to the sugar and shortening mixture so we're going to do that about a cup at a time and each time we add it just mix it at low until they are thoroughly mixed together [Music] and now the next part is the part i don't want you to skip or else you're not going to have really like thick and soft cookies you want to cover your dough and let it chill for at least an hour in the fridge and all we have left to do is to bake them so go ahead and preheat the oven to 375 if you're using a regular oven or if you have a convection oven these will do very well in their confection at 350. we're gonna scoop them out using a tablespoon cookie scoop i do love using a cookie scoop but it's absolutely not essential if you just want to use a regular spoon that's obviously fine and then roll them in that sparkling sugar this is a great job to give to your kids and they will do a good job of rolling it and then we're going to place these just on baking sheets lined with parchment paper they spread so give them a little bit of room it's going to be two baking sheets of cookies here and then we're going to bake for 9 to 11 minutes if you want them really really soft nine minutes will do it if you want a little bit of crispness on the edges 11 minutes is going to be what you're looking for you are going to see the tops crack that's totally fine it's very beautiful looking and when they're done let them cool on a wire rack um so like i said these will keep quite a few days at room temperature and stay in really good shape another option is to freeze them um and if you want to do that make the balls of dough put them on a baking sheet let them freeze those solid balls and then you can package those up either in a ziploc bag or like in a food saver and they will stay fresh and you can just pop them in the oven and bake them whenever you want as always i'm going to put the full recipe in the description box below and i will also link to where you can print out a copy and have that for yourself so it's great for really this time of year is a great time to start baking them all the way up till christmas and i hope you enjoy them thank you for watching have a good day you", "bPNEK_Pct2Q": "[Music] all right i love myself a good molasses cookie i figured why not make another recipe from claire saffid's new book dessert person i'm gonna try the chewy molasses spice cookies i'm not paid to represent this book or anything so i did a previous video on how to make the spelt croissant and they came out absolutely fabulous they were so delish so i figured why not try an easier recipe this time so we'll do the spice molasses cookies chewy molasses spice cookies to be precise all right let's just get right into it i'm not gonna show all the directions if you want this recipe go buy the book all right let's do it lots of ground ginger give it that real spicy taste i can't say i've ever had a cookie recipe call for brown black pepper allspice [Music] ah the key constituent to a good cookie lots and lots of sugar i like this recipe already it is way shorter and way [Applause] [Music] easier [Music] so [Music] interesting apple cider vinegar this should give it an interesting flavor vanilla extract and of course the last ingredient more sugar [Music] molasses [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right back to the danish dough hook like in the other videos [Music] boys these cookies smell like christmas [Music] all right i think that should do it she says divide the dough in half wrap each half in plastic refrigerate the dough until firm i can just let this refrigerate and come back to this whenever i want cookies [Music] into the fridge and then it will be baking time [Music] all right it's the next day the dough is chilled and refrigerated i will admit that last night we actually hived off a few pieces and because we felt like some cookies and we baked some of them so i've already done this so i'm gonna do is portion these off roll them in some of this she calls it claire calls it dem madeira sugar dem dem dira i believe anyways if these kind of sugar crystals these large sugar crystals all right let's do it throw it in the oven bake them and eat them [Music] each cookie is about an ounce so you roll them in a bowl and you put it in sugar do a little tossy toss [Music] all right so here's batch number one i'm going to stick them in roll up the rest bake them for i don't know about 12 minutes 13 minutes just to keep a nice soft chewy texture to them that's how i like my molasses cookies anyway all right let's put them in [Music] ok google set a timer for 12 minutes 12 minutes starting now [Music] see how as the dough is warming up how it's kind of like it's a little harder to work see it's a little getting a little gooey look at how pretty and uniform those [Music] look [Music] so [Music] so all right cookies are done this compared to the croissant recipe which you know if you haven't checked it that video i highly recommend you go check out that one that i made last time so these cookies uh the directions came out well the directions were easy to follow and the cookies came out exactly like they are supposed to i think anyway at least according to how the recipe is written the cookies got these nice cracks in it they came out perfect they're a great size um yeah so claire did a great job on testing these cookies i'm sure the directions are well like i said great they are definitely a very holiday themed cookie i'm gonna say the all of the spices in it this is definitely a very as she says in the name a very very spicy cookie like they got just the cloves the allspice the ginger very heavy heavy in spices they taste i got one here that i broke apart earlier like you can listen to this with the coating of that those big sugar crystals i don't know if you can hear that but there's like a big crunch to it the texture is really awesome when you first bite into them the center depending on how much you like them to be soft or hard you can bake them longer to make them harder you can under bake them to get them this soft texture which i prefer so you got this combination of a real nice hard texture on the outside wonderful texture and then a soft gooey inside i will say that i don't think they're my favorite cookie i prefer cookie not quite as spicy at least for a molasses cookie i prefer to have more tones of molasses than spice these are a spiced molasses cookie so if you like spicy type of cookies with real hints of allspice especially allspice and cloves you'll love these cookies so anyways another awesome recipe from claire's book dessert person so far two out of two i'm gonna try some more recipes out of it thank you so much for checking out my video i hope you guys tried some of the recipes in her book or have her book i'd be really curious to hear about the recipes that you've tried so post in the comments below if you've tried some recipes that you'd recommend me giving a shot alright thanks so much for watching and i will see you guys in the next video i should mention these dipped in coffee [Music] amazing [Music] you", "RIZcIc5MUUs": "well hello I'm having some chewy molasses cookies a little bit of hot vanilla milk and honey these cookies are absolutely chewy and delicious and the whole kitchen smells great after baking these mmm delicious and you looks really nice too you take these dumb come in a little bit in the hot milk Rock that's good to talk let's go to the kitchen and mix them right now [Music] now to make our molasses cookies what we've got here is two and a quarter cups of flour 1/2 a cup of sugar and I use my favorite de unrefined cane sugar a half a cup of butter and that butter should be yeah not really a room temperature yet kind of cold still one egg that's good to be at room temperature of course molasses 3/4 of a cup of molasses one teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of salt so first we want you to get a bowl or toss the butter in here what we want to do with the butter is 1 a cream it so just take like a wooden spoon and just cream that butter soften it up a bit and then once it's creamed there's a little softened cream in the sugar so in goes the sugar down til on the side and all we're gonna do is just cream that sugar into the butter ever I think we went over this before with cookies what happens is when you're creaming the sugar into a colder butter it tears the butter it kind of puts these little pockets of air in there and that's part of what gives you a cookie that lifts so this is a very important step you don't want that butter to warm you don't want it room temperature you want it cold and you want cream that sugar into it and it just creates those little air pockets all through the butter it does make a big difference in your cookies all right so that's looking pretty good we've got the creamed in there now we're gonna do let's get this off of here because we use the electric mixer and we're going to beat in the egg and the molasses down the side the mixer in here alright let's just crack that egg in there in goes the egg let's start beating that in first [Music] now in goes the molasses No Mas is yours have to use something to get it out of here because you know molasses takes a long time to pour so let's get that all out all right delicious I love molasses grading cooking great to eat just as is on your pancakes and things now we're going to now is going to take the electric mixer and just mix this until it's smooth alright that smooth that took like what less than a minute all that off the beaters mmm looking the beaters later on alright now what we're going to do next is just quickly going to add the baking soda the ginger the salt and the cinnamon into the a flour and just combine those first I was gonna work those in there but mm-hmm alright then add the dry to the wet mix it until combined it's really quite easy cookies to make [Music] all I do is mix this until it's all combined don't need to over mix it just get that combined in there and that is looking good all right now I'm gonna do you use a spoon put spoonfuls of this dough on to portray I've prepared that tray has been lightly buttered and then that so there's a flower it but really I prefer to use a little dusting of icing sugar because flour tends to burn a little bit in the oven and second or third time around it's not so nice anymore but icing sugar just adds a little bit extra so what we're gonna do now is just take a spoon and just draw good spoonfuls like that on to here and we want to set them about an inch or two and a half centimeters apart [Music] all right so those are I bought an inch in between them rather big they might smooshed together just a little bit but that's okay they're still just as tasty what I've got here is I've got 12 them ready to go so that oven has been preheating to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius these are gonna go in the oven for 15 minutes what we wanted was just wanted to firm up on the outside they're gonna we're gonna smooth out a little bit firm up on the outside what we've got have some delicious molasses cookies so I'll see you in 15 minutes oh yeah first batch has come out of the oven and we tap them here they're firm they've puffed up nicely you get this little crackling on them we're gonna do now is gonna let them sit here on the baking sheet and cool for about 3 to 4 minutes and then moved into a cooling rack you try to move right now they're gonna still get a little bit soft but they're gonna firm up pretty quick so there we go molasses cookies - absolutely delicious it smells so good when they're baking enjoy a batch soon now if

like a ginger not a snack because it's not hard but it's like a soft ginger cookie then we're doing orange icing on it to be so good i'm sure exactly how to do it so i love any kind of gingerbread gender snap any of that kind of spiciness of that ginger molasses cookie so i'm going to show you a fun little orange iced ginger molasses cookie they're going to be soft delicious and have a nice little glaze on top so in here i have one stick of butter that i'm going to go ahead and put with two thirds a cup of sugar and we're just going to cream this until light and fluffy and you want to

vanilla extract in here and give it a good mix all right that looks perfect so i'm gonna do is do the dry ingredients now so in here i have one and three quarters of a cup of all-purpose flour i have three quarters of a teaspoon of baking soda a half a teaspoon of salt one and a half teaspoons of ground ginger a half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon a quarter teaspoon ground nutmeg and a quarter teaspoon clove that's a mouthful this is really what gives that classic flavor the ginger i mean hello gingerbread man with the ground ginger in there so we're just gonna mix this up all right so i'm gonna add this in our wet ingredients here give it a good mix until just combined all right this is perfect so i just want to make sure it's all combined so now what i'm going to do this is a kind of loose dough oh so good so what i'm going to do i'm going to put this into the fridge and let this chill this don't chill for about 15 minutes uncovered what that's going to do is kind of dry it out a little bit and make it a little easier to work with i like to spread it out then all right put it into our fridge 15 minutes so this has been in there as you can see they've it's kind of firmed up a little bit so what i'm gonna do take like one and a half tablespoons just like this roll it into a bowl see it's a lot easier to handle roll it in some sugar because hello why not put it on here and then just i'm just going to flatten them slightly not too much all right i'm going to keep doing this and then i'm going to bake them 350 for about seven minutes until they're starting to pop up a little bit and then i'm going to show you how to make that beautiful icing for the top all right wonderful and they go these cookies are amazing they're gonna be soft yet chewy yet delicious amazing so in here it's time to make our glaze i'm gonna do one cup of powdered sugar i'm going to do a half a teaspoon of some vanilla extract [Music] i'm gonna do two teaspoons of some half and half but you can also use heavy cream you could use um whole milk [Music] okay now it doesn't sound like a lot but trust me a little liquid goes a long way i'm going to add some orange zest in here now when baking i love using the zest because you really don't have to have a specific quantity it's not going to mess anything up so you can kind of go wild with the zest if you want and spices so i'm going to do like a teaspoon i want a pretty orange flavor and then i'm gonna cut this in half it should be good and i'm gonna do also i made these kind of bigger if you want to make them smaller you could totally do that as well i'm gonna cut my orange in half and i'm going to do well first of all let me mix this together see what the consistency is looking like like i said a little liquid goes a long way with this powdered sugar it's crazy okay so we're gonna do about two to three so let's start off with two and make sure you use the good stuff the fresh stuff it's not hard trust me it makes a difference i promise see how it's already getting so liquidy okay i think one more should be sufficient one more in there right much better you know what i might do a tiny no that's probably good because i don't want it to completely just drip off all right perfect so what i'm going to do oh can i try it oh yeah oh that's going to complement these so well so take the cookies dip the tops in one of my favorite

chewy on the inside i look forward to reading all of your comments below and thanks for watching see you again soon you", "BZ6IvSxFN60": "Hi everyone! Sam here from SugarSpunRun.com. Today I'm going to be showing you how to make molasses cookies. We're going to start with 3/4 cups, or one and a half sticks of unsalted butter Add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, and we're also going to use 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. You can\nuse light brown sugar if you don't have dark, but I like the dark brown sugar\nbecause it gives the cookies a nice dark color and I think the flavor is a little\nextra intense. Beat these until they're well creamed. (electric mixer running) And then beat in one large egg. (electric mixer running) We're going to use 1/4 cup molasses for this recipe. You want to use unsulfured molasses. The bottle that you buy should say unsulfured right on the\nlabel. I don't recommend using blackstrap molasses for this recipe. Add 1/4 cup of\nmolasses. And 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir these together. (Electric mixer running) Now let's combine our dry ingredients. We're going to start with two and a quarter cups of\nall-purpose flour, and as with most of my recipes we're going to add a teaspoon of cornstarch to help make these molasses cookies really nice and soft. A teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.\nNow we're going to add some spices. These spices are what give your molasses\ncookies a really nice flavor. Don't leave any of them out. A teaspoon of ground\ncinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. Stir\nthese together. Bring back your wet ingredients and add your dry ingredients\nto your wet ingredients. I like to add about half of the dry ingredients at a time. As the dough becomes more difficult to\nstir you can bring back your electric mixer. (Electric mixer noise) Now cover your dough. Now you need to chill your cookie dough for at least 3 hours. After your dough has chilled for\nat least 3 hours go ahead and remove it from the refrigerator. Pre-heat your oven\nto 375 degrees Fahrenheit and we're going to scoop it into tablespoons sized\nballs. Once you roll your cookies into balls then you're going to roll them in\ngranulated sugar. You can use just plain granulated sugar. I like to use a coarse\n cane sugar but either one will work just fine. Roll the dough in sugar. And place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Keep your cookies spaced about 2\ninches apart and then make them on 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes. Your cookies will be a little bit puffy when they finish baking, but as they cool they'll settle and will get nice cracks on top. And that is how you make these\nperfectly spiced, nice and soft, and chewy on the inside, crisp and sparkly on the\noutside molasses cookies. As you saw these are really easy to make. Nice\nand crinkled tops on the outside and so soft and chewy on the inside. I think\nyou guys are really gonna love these cookies. So try them out let me know what you think. Make sure to leave a comment and I'll see you next time.", "mR4zUL0wdmQ": "[Music] hello it's april from april's home and today i thought i would share with you another cookie recipe this is one of our family's very favorite cookies we always make it for christmas and i also make it throughout the year a few times these are my molasses cookies this is a double batch but i always make a double batch so i thought i would go ahead and just share that with you it can be cut in half if you just want a really small batch um okay so you'll need flour and molasses you'll need three sticks of butter or a cup and a half of butter um and i will soften that in the microwave you'll need allspice two eggs baking soda sugar powdered sugar we'll sprinkle powdered sugar on these cookies at the very end when they're cooled and cinnamon so as you can see very simple ingredients that make an absolutely delicious cookie again one of my family's favorites okay so the first thing i've done is unwrap my three sticks of butter again this is a cup and a half of butter and i'm gonna go ahead and microwave this until it is just about melted it doesn't have to be completely melted but just about so i'm gonna go ahead and put that in my microwave and i'll be back to get started with the recipe okay so i have my butter all melted and i'm gonna go ahead and put it into my mixing bowl here and see that some of it is not melted but that's okay plenty is melted so it will blend up nicely i'm gonna grab a rubber scraper and get the rest of that out and next we're going to blend in two cups of sugar here's one cup and two and i'm just going to blend this together with my electric mixer i'm going to start by just kind of incorporating it while it's off so that we don't get a splash of hot melted butter and then we'll go ahead and blend this together okay so we have our sugar and butter blended together now i'm gonna go ahead and add the eggs and molasses so we have two eggs that we're adding okay so there are eggs added and now for the molasses again uh if you've seen my other videos when i add molasses i first use a little bit of pan spray to coat the inside of my measuring cup so that the molasses comes out with ease instead of sticking to the inside of the cup here so there i've sprayed it and i'm adding half a cup of molasses and you can see that most came out with ease so that's why i like to spray that okay so now we'll go ahead and blend this together until it's mixed together completely so now it's time to add our dry ingredients we're going to go ahead and start with four cups of flour one two three and four then i'm going to add four teaspoons of baking soda and i'm going to make sure to distribute it just gently over the top there because later i'm going to mix that in with a spoon before we blend it in so here's my second teaspoon third and fourth now we'll need two teaspoons of cinnamon one and two and lastly one teaspoon of allspice and here is our teaspoon of allspice and now so that we avoid having any pockets with too much baking soda or spice i like to take a spoon and just incorporate the dry ingredients together on top of the wet ingredients without kind of dipping down in and incorporating yet any of the uh wet ingredients this avoids having to mix your dry ingredients in a separate bowl okay so that's pretty well mixed and now i'm going to go ahead and blend this all together you want to actually start on a little bit of a lower speed at first right in the center here so that we're not blasting flour around just kind of work it nice and slowly sometimes i like to turn it off kind of start in another area and of course we'll use our rubber scraper part way through to make sure that we're getting all the flour from the sides [Music] i'm going to take a few minutes here to scrape around the sides and make sure that the sides and the bottom aren't having pockets of dry ingredients so that we can get that all incorporated together just makes it a little easier on the mixer okay and then i'm going to go ahead and get this blended the rest of the way okay so the dough is all mixed together and i'm just going to go around and kind of smooth this out then i'm going to cover this with saran wrap and put it in the fridge to chill for one hour so i've used the rubber scraper to kind of form it into a little bit of a together little ball here in the bottom of the bowl and i've covered it with saran wrap and i just kind of tuck the saran wrap right onto the dough there so as a nice seal and now this is going in the fridge for one hour to chill and i'll be back to show you how we bake these up my dough has been chilling for an hour and you can see that it is firmed up a bit here so now i've got my baking sheet ready and i've lined it with a sheet of parchment paper here if you don't have parchment paper you can just use pan spray but i would highly recommend using parchment paper for cookie baking it makes things so much easier the cookies typically never stick to this and clean up is just very easy and you can do multiple batches on this one paper and so i do recommend parchment paper but again you can just use pan spray i have my cookie scooper out here and i'm just going to scoop a ball and place it on the sheet here and i'm going to leave a lot of room on here i'll put probably put eight cookies on this because they do spread out quite a bit if you do not have a cookie scoop just use a tablespoon and kind of roll the cookie into a little bit of a ball shape before um putting it onto the cookie sheet so here's how i filled it i haven't done a big rounded scoop just a little half scoop like that so it looks like that when it comes out cookie scoops are also really really handy i didn't use one for a very long time in baking and when i finally got one i just loved it so there we'll do one in the center i'm just arranging them to the furthest um point here on the sheet that i think that they'll spread just like so so we've got eight um little cookies here and now i'm gonna go ahead and get a cup just a little um drinking cup here a little one and i'm going to use some pan spray and spray the bottom just like so i'm going to use this to lightly press the cookie down you might need to help it unstick a little bit but this just kind of flattens the cookie out to help with even baking so i've got all the cookies flattened out my oven has been preheating i should have mentioned this sooner my oven is preheated to 350 degrees fahrenheit so now i'm going to go ahead and put these in the oven and they bake pretty quickly you'll want to check these at about seven minutes just to make sure that they're not overcooking but they typically take between eight and nine minutes per batch so i'm going to go ahead and pop these in the oven and i'll show you what they look like when they come out and while the others are in the oven baking i have a second cookie sheet here also lined with parchment and i'm gonna get another batch ready to go in so that when the first batch is out i can get another one right in the oven okay so i pulled the first batch out of the oven again that's 350 degrees for about eight minutes and you definitely want to pull them out while they're kind of golden brown around the outside but still look a little undercooked in the middle and you leave them to sit on the cooling rack for about a minute before you take them off and put them on your cooling rack these here might have been a little bit overcooked i like to see a little bit more of that lighter center this one looks just about perfect these are a little bit on the dark side but we'll see when they cool up how they taste and as you can see these have all cooked together so i'm going to try to space them a little bit further or use a little bit less dough on the next batch and since these are stuck together here i'll just use my spatula to cut them apart before i lift them out just like so and you'll want a pretty um smaller grid type of cooling rack rather than the one with just the long wires if you have it because when they're hot they do tend to kind of sink in a little bit if you have a cooling rack with larger grooves but if you don't that's fine too i've made them using both types of cooling racks okay so you can see we have a nice big batch of these molasses cookies all baked up i let them cool in a single row here like this and then as they become cool i stack them up in the back there um i'm just about to put my last tray in here after the one before that comes out when these are cool i'm gonna lay these out in a single row and show you how to put the powdered sugar on these i use a powdered sugar shaker you could also use a mesh strainer basket or a sifter or something like that to dust these with powdered sugar so i'm going to go ahead and bake up the last batch and let them all cool and come back to show you how we get the powdered sugar topping on these okay so we've got our cookies cooling and flat here we've got a bunch stacked up in the back there and now it's time to get some powdered sugar on them i will go ahead and use this here it's a powdered sugar shaker i got it years ago actually probably need to get a new one this one's getting a little bit on the old side but for now i cleaned it out it works really nicely and you just sprinkle over the top just like so and like i said if you don't have one of these powdered sugar shakers you could use a metal strainer or perhaps a flower sifter or something like that and probably even just sprinkle it over using your hands would be fine so i like to get a good coating on these just like so and then i'm going to pack this layer away into my cookie bin and then lay out another layer to go ahead and get covered in powdered sugar i'll come back and show you when they're all in my cookie bin ready to go and here you can see my cookie bin i have one of these round um shallow cookie tubs that i picked up at walmart this year you can see i've got most of my cookies in there there's still a few cooling up that i'll go ahead when they're cool and get them powdered and put into this cookie tub so those are my molasses cookies i'm going to be serving these tomorrow for family dinner nights we have a nice christmasy treat i'll also be baking up some other cookies and i'll be sharing those recipes with you in the coming days as well i'll be sure and include a clip of our cookie tray for family dinner night so you can see how i have these all set up and also i'll be sending home some of our cookies with the kids so they have some to enjoy at their home too so those are my molasses cookies i hope you enjoyed hearing my recipe and

satisfying and therapeutic just keep on mixing it until it's thicker and it starts to look like this okay I have a quick question look at what we've got here now are you having a flashback to your high school art class I think you are because so am I now cover the bowl with saran wrap and make sure that it's airtight and put it in the fridge for a minimum of three hours this can actually stay in the fridge for up to five days once your dough is raised you can take it out unroll the cookies into 60-gram bowls [Music] NIC's to cut the cookie dough in the sugar then fled the model a bit like this now you can heat at the oven and put your cookies on a baking tray lined with parchment paper finally sprinkle them with some sugar and it's time to bake bake the cookies for 11 to 13 minutes depending on your oven settings and they should turn out like this these are some of the best cookies that you're ever gonna make apart from your grandma's of course they looked apart in the aroma is truly phenomenal enjoy guys enjoy thanks for watching I'm the painter pastor I'll see you next time when the painter pastor who writes again [Music]", "1L2IRNZxeRA": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my channel if you're new here i'm lisa also known as al adult jeleesa or maybe even mrs. claus today because today we are going to be doing an exciting a video for christmas time today i'm going to be showing you how to make a my a favorite cookies pretty much my favorite cookies to have during this time of the year and that is of my ginger molasses cookies if you're familiar with your typical gingerbread cookie if this has the same flavors but instead of being crunchy it's going to be a nice soft and chewy cookie with maybe like a slight crisp on the outside but it's going to be so good and delicious I can't wait to show you how to make them and on top of that I'm going to be doing a little holiday spin and I will be decorating these to look a super-cute for Christmas time so I'll show you how to do that as well so if you would like to learn how to make it these gender and molasses cookies please keep watching and go ahead and give this video a thumbs up so this recipe is actually as easy as it is a delicious let's start with the dry ingredients first that way we can set them aside and have them all ready when we need them so first things first I have two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour right in this bowl and to that I'm going to be adding one and a half teaspoons of baking soda so right into the flour mixture I have these spices are ready to go so what I have here is two and a half teaspoons of ginger two and a half teaspoons of cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of allspice and half a teaspoon of salt so I have that right in this mix and I'm going to be adding this to the flour mixture this is what's going to make these ginger molasses cookies a super spicy and delicious so be sure to be using a fresh ingredient make sure that your ginger and your cinnamon haven't gone stale because then they will lose some flavor so we're just going to be giving these ingredients up quick mix and now that my dry mix is ready to go and all of the dry ingredients are incorporated I'm going to be setting that aside and now it's time to work on the batter we have 3/4 of a cup of butter or a 1 and a half sticks if that's where you're using we're going to be adding this right to the Kitchen Aid and this is unsalted room-temperature butter it's important about this butter is that it is at room temperature all of the ingredients should really be at room temperature to ensure a better tasting and better texture cookie so try not to melt the butter just try to leave it out for about an hour - that way it is nice and room temperature now we are going to be adding a B sugars 1/2 a cup of white sugar right into the mix and I have 1/2 a cup of packed brown sugar that is going right to the butter and sugar mix so as you can see that brown sugar was quite packed and before we add the rest of our ingredients we are going to be giving this a whip to incorporate so we're going to be doing this on a medium to low speed for about 2 minutes the butter and sugar it seemed to have whipped up nicely the color is a little bit pale and that's what we want so now we are just going to be adding at the molasses and this is 1/4 of a cup of molasses right into the mixture this little tiny spatula it's actually good to push this through because you want to scrape out every little bit of molasses I like to add this molasses right before I add the egg that way the mixture it doesn't really curdle so we're just going to be adding the molasses and giving this a 30-second whip now that we have the butter and all of these sugars combined it is time for the final wet ingredient a 1 a large egg and it is also at room temperature right in the mix we are just going to be whipping this for maybe a minute or so that the batter is basically almost done last thing we need is a V dry mixture that we made earlier so we're going to add this I would say I'm going to be adding this about a third at a time until this bowl is empty so one third of the flour mix in a couple spins and then I'm going to keep going don't forget that during this whole process especially for using a stand mixer like me you'll probably have to scrape the sides of the bowl ok so my assistant and I have already tasted the batter and it tastes good as it is but of course we can't make this off yet so I transferred this into this small bowl I'm just going to be covering this with plastic wrap and pretty this in the fridge for one hour that one on the fridge is crucial because it helps the flavors develop and it gives a nicer looking cookie I find when I usually keep the dough in the fridge and I will see you guys back in one hour for when I roll these and bake them so it's about an hour later I just took my dough out of the fridge and it is nice and chilled and are ready to roll so what I got here is about a quarter of a cup of coarse sugar I'm just using organic a sugar cane sugar I like that the granules are more coarse but you can even use just regular granulated or castor sugar so what I'm doing is with this ice cream scooper I feel like this gives me about two inch round cookies I'm just scooping out the dough rolling it with my hands with clean hands of course and then I'm going to be dipping this in this sugar just giving it a little roll around and coating all the sides this will give your ginger molasses cookies and that nice crunch on the outside so it's really nice with that soft gooey Center and I'm just going to lightly press down on the cookies just a bit so that they think evenly when they are on the tray now give me some space when you're placing them down it because they do is spread out quite a bit so you'll just want to space them out I mean at least a cookies width in between so pretend I was invisible cookie right in between the batter so I'm just going to be spitting out base cookies and doing that for the entire batch right here let's see how many I can fit on this tray before I pop these in the oven you may be able to hear about my oven is preheating it to 350 right now now on this tree I managed to fit twelve but there's still of some leftover dough so I feel like in this batter you should be able to get out about sixteen cookies or more or landing on how big or small you roll these I'm going to be popping these into this oven effort Oh [Music] okay so you'll want to bake those cookies on parchment paper and a 350 degree oven for about eight to nine minutes you shouldn't really bake them longer than nine minutes because then they won't be as soft and chewy on the inside now that my cookies have finally finished baking they are out of the oven and they're cooling down we can now make the decorative part that goes on top and guys it really couldn't be easier but it adds such a beautiful touch you of course don't have to do this to all the cookies and I won't I'll just do it to some of the cookies but it makes them look so festive and cute so what I got here is some white chocolate I used about three ounces you know those cubes of Baker's white chocolate I just use half of that and I diced it up and now we're going to melt this chocolate in the microwave now how I melt this chocolate is I usually put it in for 30 seconds give it a mix put it in for another 20 seconds give it another mix if it's ready fine if it's not another 10 seconds and you're good to go you always want to be very careful when melting white chocolate and on top of that I have these cute little festive sprinkles and I'm going to show you how I use these in just a second I have most of my cookies here are ready to decorate this batch made exactly 16 cookies it could have maybe made more if I didn't eat so much battery but there you go they're a little bit chubby and a fluffy and a little bit crinkly and they look amazing but we're not done yet because like I said we are going to be decorating some of these for the holidays so I have a plastic baggie here this is my favorite trick when it comes to piping anything I'm just going to be putting this in a cup holding it over and now this a white chocolate that we melt it is absolutely perfect those amounts of seconds usually work the best for a white chocolate so let's just get all of that melted white chocolate into this plastic baggie right here perfect this little special has come in handy and we're just going to give this a little twist you don't have to worry about sealing this by now with scissors I'm just going to cut off a tiny little snippet of the tip what I'm doing is just drizzling at that white chocolate onto the cookie I'm almost going halfway through I find that looks the most elegant and now that I finished with the white chocolate drizzle they would look even a nice like this I feel like that is so classy but I happen to find these really cute holiday sprinkles and I feel like this is going to make them look so festive and cute so you actually need a pair of tweezers make sure they're of course clean and because I feel like there's so tiny they're really just hard to do so I'm going to be placing them on to the cookie and I will show you how I arrange these to give it that nice Christmas decorative feel of course you can just sprinkle these on if you would like but I find that I like to make a little decorative patterning there so it's basically like Christmas trees and like little red dots and I'm sort of arranging them to look like Christmas Holly I have finished baking and decorating and I have to say that it was actually super easy super simple even in terms of the decoration I mean just that little finishing touch went a long way because look how beautiful these are I of course left a few plain that here we have this beautiful ginger molasses cookie dressed so festively some of them I put three Hollies and so on them only two so you can decorate at your leisure but here we go and I'm about to bite into this cookie [Music] Wow the best if you guys love a ginger molasses cookies

yeah they're so good it looks so pretty the recipe yeah not enough I really think that [Music]", "AurBkfGdeak": "[Music] hey punches welcome to the channel if you're new i'm alyssia so today i'm so excited because i am sharing my favorite cookie of all time and it's not healthy so context since going on this journey that i've been on the last couple of years to heal my relationship with food a lot of surprising things have happened so for one i'm less stressed about food and health i spent so many years stressing out trying to make the right food choices and do right by my body and you know just feel good about myself and i found that the stress wasn't helping so that's one the second thing is i now give myself permission to eat more of what i love i was constantly trying to find substitutions for the foods that i loved you know just to scratch the itch but it never really satisfied and now i just give myself permission to have whatever it is i've talked about this a couple of times in videos this year and i'll link those in the description below if you want more content like this i also find that i enjoy eating healthy foods more often now that i give myself the permission to eat the less healthy foods when i feel inclined to as well overall that means i feel a lot less struggle and resistance with food and health and just being myself and i feel like that's really what most of us want is to just feel okay as we are so i just feel so relieved that i have found this path with food and that i've done this work it has been a lot of work but it's given me so much peace and ease with food and i find that i make healthier choices without having to think about it and i'm just eager to share this on the channel so in january i'm doing a free course and video series the videos are going to be on youtube but you have to sign up for the course materials through mindovermunch.com food freedom if you want like the pdf downloads and all of the other course materials because it's going to be easier to send those out via email every single day then put everything in every single description of the video because there's going to be 20 videos monday through friday all of january i'm talking about healing relationships with food so cookies i used to be an all or nothing person with food it seemed i mean i was telling myself i could either not have any of it or i was saying screw it and eating all of it until you know i could start fresh on a monday or january 1st or whatever and that created this really nasty dieting cycle where i would you know eat well i'd get healthy start again and then i would deprive myself deprive myself deprive myself until i lost it and then i would binge everything in sight and then i would feel really terrible and judge myself and then i would have to start all over again on a monday okay and so i figured out how to break this cycle and i love actually drawing these cycles out and i'm gonna do it for you in the january series and so the question really becomes well a can i see the cycle can i have some enough awareness to map out that cycle and i'm going to show you how to do that and then once i see the cycle on paper where can i break the cycle so that it doesn't continue again and again and again because that you know it's like a it's almost like i mean there's a couple of visuals it could be like a pendulum back and forth or a yo-yo between depriving restricting and eating everything or it could be the circular motion whatever resonates with you but what i found is what if i just didn't deprive myself anymore what if i didn't say i can't have it is that where i could break the cycle for me the answer was yes and i talked about this in my fear foods video where i shared my foods with emotional attachment and rules concept and i also touched on it in my holiday foods anxiety episode last month so today i thought it would be a perfect opportunity instead of making you know healthy cookies made out of chickpeas or cauliflower or whatever which no judgment for anyone who loves that or that's where you're at in your journey because i that was a part of my journey too but now i embrace my deeper truth which is i want the real deal i would rather be really present with the entire experience of baking the cookies and taking it all in with my senses and then enjoying them mindfully so the molasses crinkles recipe i'm going to share with you has been my favorite for years it's my favorite holiday cookie of all time i make it for family and friends every single year it's not healthy it's full of gluten and has real sugar and real butter but i actually had never looked at this cookies nutrition before this year when i decided to do it for this video so i calculated out the nutrition just to see it's not as bad as you think and i'm gonna share it at the end of the video once you see the cookies so how do i bring mindfulness which i believe mindfulness is how i really healed my relationship with food and i'm going to talk about it so much in january how do i bring mindfulness to the experience not just of the eating but of the cooking so mindfulness it's can be easily defined as a non-judgmental awareness of the present moment it needs those three components i have to be present right now in this moment i have to be aware of what's happening and seeing clearly and i have to be non-judgmental for both of those things to occur because if i'm judging stuff if i'm judging myself for what i'm eating if i'm judging other people then i'm not really seeing it clearly i'm seeing it through a biased lens if i can have a non-judgmental awareness of the present moment then i'm mindful essentially i ask what's happening now my favorite way to tune in to this present moment awareness is through the senses and i'm going to talk about that as i make these most delicious cookies for you and i highly recommend you make them yourself for yourself and your loved ones so not only are these cookies the most delicious cookies ever they are super easy to make so first i just mixed together my dry ingredients this is all-purpose flour i have tried using a gluten-free substitute and doesn't work as well this is baking soda salt cinnamon allspice and cloves okay so i'm just going to whisk that together and really like i said bring mindfulness to the experience when you do it one thing i love is the smell of these spices together and it's something i never used to pay attention to i would just kind of tune out during the baking part and wait for the eating and then i would notice sometimes i would eat so many cookies and i'm not even paying attention to it so bringing mindfulness to the experience you can only really experience those in this present moment so if i'm smelling these delicious spices right now i'm smelling them now i'm not smelling you know something i smelled yesterday or i'm not seeing the texture of the flower or the softened butter from yesterday i'm seeing it right now i'm hearing the sounds of mixing uh with the hand mixer or whisking right now i'm feeling myself press the button of the hand mixer and feeling it you know kind of vibrate in my hand when i'm adding in the sugar i i love to see how you know the crystals of sugar reflect the light smelling it as it all comes together my palate is salivating i just want to eat this butter and sugar mixture already i know this is all about mindfulness but just a recipe note this butter has to be actually softened like i usually do it overnight i've tried a couple of times just like quick softening the butter like when you forget it doesn't work as well so follow the actual recipe for this one if you want it to come out real good now i'm adding in one egg white yolk you don't need for this recipe what's gonna happen when i whip it up how does it look how does it all come together all right and now what makes it a molasses crinkle the molasses and just notice the textures notice the colors notice the way that the flower mixture falls onto the wet mixture watch it as you fold it all together what does it feel like in your hand you know to move this spatula through this mixture it feels like a light cloud like it's so airy and fluffy and it's going to look like it's not integrating but it is and once it does stop you don't want to overdo it just until there's no more white flour okay i'm spraying down a pan with parchment and i also just spray the cookie scoop so it's easier to manipulate i'm just going to scoop these out and then drop them either into the sugar or i kind of like to round it out and you see it's sticky but it's not so sticky that it's sticking to my hands into the sugar so i know you might want to like speed through this part but really notice what does it feel like to have that dough in your hands does it feel pleasant unpleasant neutral as the dough sits here if this takes me a couple minutes it might soften as i go so notice how it changes how does it feel to plunge this spoon into the sugar and remember part of using the senses and tuning in is your sense of taste so don't forget to taste the dough too it's a part of the mindfulness experience oh my gosh so my cookies are ready i got 20 cookies today i for some reason felt like this recipe usually yields 14 to 16. i'm not gonna complain about extra though so i have both of my trays going into the oven 350 degrees for 13 to 15 minutes [Music] so these are out of the oven the house smells so good bring mindfulness to this experience no reason not to absorb all the delicious smells and look at them i mean before i sit down to indulge in these mindfully just take a look look at the colors look at the textures i love how they crack on the top i love the sugar the crystallized sugar that's on the outside and how some of it is on the very edges of the crack some of it's on the inside of the cracks notice you know which one do i feel inclined to pick up which one do i want to eat first when i want to be mindful with my experience i want to sit down so i have a seat here and i'm going to sit i have my milk my glass of milk not almond milk dairy milk and i'm going to pick a cookie hmm this like takes me back to being a little kid you know when it's like i really wanted to be intentional with which one i picked i'm going with this one with the extra sugar crystal goodness on top so i want to take this in with all of my senses i'm looking at it i'm seeing the crystallized sugar i'm seeing the nice cracking on top i know these cookies because i made them so many times they're crunchy on the outside and and like soft on the inside but i can feel that it's firm here and softer here i can break it open [Music] and it's like looks all fudgy and delicious inside almost cakey i've noticed since i've been eating more mindfully that when i smell the food before i eat it the taste is so much stronger so i want to make the most of this experience you know i've been mindful with the whole preparation and now that i'm sitting down to eat it i don't want to miss any of it so i'm just gonna smell it oh it smells so good i'm gonna take a bite all the textures crunchy on the outside soft and chewy on the inside there's an extra crunch from the crystallized sugar it's a rich molasses flavor with the cinnamon allspice and cloves it tastes like christmas in a cookie listening to myself even chew noticing the impulse to even want to swallow the cookie before i even swallow it and before i go to take another bite can i be just as present with that one does anything how does the cookie look different now does it change my experience of how i'm enjoying it if you've never practiced mindful eating before it can seem a little tedious from the outside it seems like why do you have to get so granular you don't have to right you don't have to eat this way but this is just a way to be more present and mindful with the experiences taking it in all the information we've taken in the entire world we do through our five senses so if i'm not present with the senses i'm taking in this information without really being aware of it if i'm going to eat some delicious food like this i want to be as fully present as possible that means using as many of the senses as i can and also noticing how i feel inside physiologically and emotionally and letting that guide the experience so paying attention when i when i go a little more slowly i can notice this more am i getting full off of this cookie not yet i can keep going are my taste buds um changing physiologically your taste buds can only taste something this strong for the first couple of bites and after three four five bites it starts to diminish so when i bring mindfulness to this experience sometimes i find i get to the end of a cookie or even through half a cookie and i'm like oh it doesn't taste as strong anymore that doesn't mean i don't finish it necessarily but just to notice because then if i can be that present i can decide do i want another cookie you know does it would it taste good to me right now or do i want to save it for later sometimes i decide to eat it even if it doesn't sound like it would taste great right now maybe i emotionally want to eat the cookie and this is one thing i want to talk about in january is it is okay to turn to food emotionally sometimes but we have to have a general awareness around the experience of doing it and really be intentional about how we do it this is not intended to be a healthy cookie i would say this is just a regular cookie recipe and i've never looked at the nutrition before but i decided to calculate it out for this episode and i couldn't believe like this just goes to show how we get ideas in our head about what's good and bad and what's allowed or not allowed right so i would i had all these rules like oh if it's paleo it's okay if it doesn't have real sugar it's okay if it if it's gluten-free it's okay right these are some of the rules i had created and lived by for a long time i calculated out the nutrition and of course calories are not everything but these calories if this recipe yields 20 cookies are only 74 calories per cookie they were also using full fat butter regular butter only two grams of fat per cookie 11 grams of carbs seven of which were sugar okay so this is not i would say it's not a healthy cookie it's not a vegetable it's not giving you you know nutrients it's not providing your body with nutrients but it's not doing a ton of damage either and what i had to confront in my own journey i'm not saying this is right for you or wrong for you or anything but eating you know paleo or chickpea cookies or something like that trying to scratch this itch when they're never good they're never as tasty but they're really probably not that much better nutritionally either right like if it's a paleo cookie and it's using coconut sugar that's still going to affect my blood sugar that's still sugar so i've decided for me bringing mindfulness to the experience of eating the real deal is more worth it now that i know that these cookies are 74 calories each this is another opportunity for me to bring mindfulness to the experience because i can start to notice any attachment or rules right am i noticing maybe i deserve to eat another one because they're less calories right and this is no right or wrong this is not me saying yes eat another one or no don't eat another one this is just notice the inclination to set the rule that's what i talked about in the holiday food anxiety video last month is just notice the inclination to set the rules the attachment to the rules and it'll start to change on its own i just want to bring mindfulness to this to say so that when i eat the second cookie i know am i doing this because i really want to do it and i really want to be present and taste every bite of it or am i doing it because i'm setting an arbitrary food rule and i'm tuning out a couple of notes about these cookies i highly recommend testing them out i make these as gifts for family and friends every single year they actually come to expect these because they are my main cookie you can freeze these too and you can double the recipe so if you want to make them in bulk just double the recipe and freeze them for yourself or someone else of course they're best fresh i want you to enjoy the holidays fully i have been more present with this than the old me would have who would have you know rushed through the baking part anxious and then i would judge myself for eating you know three or six or more of them and never actually be present fully present with one of them so now i might have one or two or three or maybe i will have six but i'll do it enjoying every single bite and stop when i'm not i'm an adult and this is one thing i've learned in this journey is i can i can make these cookies anytime and i can enjoy them anytime i can make them in july and i do sometimes this is the power of tuning in if this is what i'm really craving and wanting i can learn to give myself permission to have it and i am going to teach you some of the specific tools that i learned and that i have employed uh when i go through the free course in january remember uh you can sign up at mindovermunch.com food freedom to get on the list for that so try them out highly recommended and tag me on social media if you do i wouldn't actually call this a milk dipping cookie but it's good to have on the side have a wonderful rest of the holidays enjoy them fully and remember especially when it comes to eating holiday goods it's all a matter of mind over munch you", "KboHo1xKPYU": "what moves together in style today I'm going to share with you a great recipe for an apple molasses cookie I happen to be really fond of molasses cookies and I know my husband's gonna be thrilled that I'm baking cookies today because he's such a cookie monster but the ingredients are so perfect together and they make a fantastic cookie so we have some dark brown sugar we have some really great spices together that really work well we have cinnamon and ginger ground cloves and also some nutmeg so those spices together are just perfect and I'm going to use apple sauce along with some vanilla real apples and we can't forget the molasses because this is what makes the molasses cooking the molasses cookie so my first step is I'm going to take five small apples and I'm going to cut them into small little pieces they're pretty small because they happen to be coming from some apple trees in our yard so they don't necessarily get all that large so you're gonna have to decide based on the apples that you purchased or you happen to pick how many or how much you might want to have but I'm gonna have five in mind so you want to cut the apples and really tiny just bite-sized pieces they're delicious but I noticed that when I was cutting everything up I had one apple left over so I actually only needed four apples you do want to cut up about two cups of apples just in really tiny pieces so I'll put that one back where it belongs so now we're onto the KitchenAid so let's make the dough so we're gonna first start off by putting the two cups of apples into the bowl perfect and now I have some applesauce now this is important because most cookies you need some kind of an oil so instead of using oil I decided that I was going to use applesauce and a lot of times when you're baking a cake or you're baking cookies you can substitute applesauce for oil and it's so easy to remember because if you need 1/2 a cup of oil you need 1/2 a cup of applesauce so that's exactly what I'm going to use right now 1/2 a cup of applesauce and we have our vanilla so there is a 2 teaspoons of vanilla in that and we have our spices so we have 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon we have a teaspoon of each of the other spices the ground ginger the ground clove and also the nutmeg so we're going to put that all in there and I also have a cup of firmly packed dark brown sugar so it does not pop that in there great one egg we have a teaspoon of baking soda and we also have 2 cups of flour just all-purpose flour is fine so we're just going to pour that right in there and I mentioned that we have some cinnamon and sugar but I'm actually going to save this until the dough is made so we can roll the dough and then roll it right into the cinnamon and sugar before you pop it in the oven but this recipe would not be complete without our molasses so I'm gonna just open this right up nice and dark and delicious and I'm gonna take 1/2 a cup and just pour that right inside totally reminds me of the holidays such comfort food all right onca mixing so I'm gonna take my mixing tool pop that in my KitchenAid and of course lock it down and start it up I'm just gonna start it up slow just to kind of get everything mixed together and then we'll speed it up ooh that looks really good and smells really good but it doesn't quite look like the cookie batter that I was dreaming of it's obvious that I'm gonna need to add in more some more flour depending on the time of year if it's humid out or it could be even the elevation that you're living in sometimes you do need to modify things just to make them better so we're gonna add in just a little more flour until I like the consistency the nice thing about adding just a little flour at a time is that you can see the consistency and I can already see it getting better I want to be able to roll these cookies so I do want the cookie dough to be a little bit on the thick side almost there all right so I actually ended up having to add in about another cup of flour so to total three cups of flour for this recipe I'm gonna put it in the refrigerator to have it cool down for about 20 minutes and then I'm gonna roll them into little balls and into the cinnamon and sugar and pop them right into the oven all right now that the batter is cooled off and it's been in the refrigerants I'm just gonna wet my fingers so I can roll the dough into a nice little ball we're gonna put it into the cinnamon and sugar and now these cookies are just like Ginger Snaps so they're not really fluffy cookies they're gonna find out so you want to make sure that you have enough room in between each cookie so they don't stick together the cookies came out of the oven the oven was on 350 it only took eight to nine minutes for each batch to come out and they looked fantastic they smelled great and I can't wait to try them I know they're gonna go fantastic with my morning coffee the texture is just like a gingerbread but it's amazing you can taste the Apple right inside these are delicious and yes perfect with coffee so from me to you enjoy these cookies together in style you", "-O9cZTJEMrs": "hello today instead of english project we're gonna

make the most delicious molasses crinkle cookies or molasses ginger cookies or whatever you like to call them at your house these are a more gourmet version of that cookie and they use butter instead of Crisco which is of course going to give us a much better flavor and it's more natural this recipe will make about four dozen cookies because I think around Christmastime you always want to have extra cookies to share with family and friends but you can always have this recipe and it will work just as well so I'm starting off here measuring out 22 and a half ounces of all-purpose flour or four and a half cups of all-purpose flour and we're going to add to this two teaspoons of baking soda three teaspoons of ground cinnamon three teaspoons of ground ginger [Music] one teaspoon of ground cloves this recipe calls for half a teaspoon of allspice but I didn't have any so I am substituting half a teaspoon of pumpkin spice it has pretty much the same ingredient and we're going to do half a teaspoon of black ground pepper and half a teaspoon of table salt whisk all these ingredients together to combine and set aside and we're going to pull out our standing mixer and put into it three sticks of softened butter or 24 tablespoons and with the butter we're going to add in two-thirds of a cup of brown sugar or five ounces and two-thirds of a cup of granulated sugar or five ounces and we're going to beat together the butter and the sugar until it turns a nice light color and has a fluffy consistency so that'll be about three minutes so I'm going to turn down the speed and I'm going to add a two egg yolks and two teaspoons of vanilla extract now beat this together for about 20 seconds until it's well combined and lastly we're going to add my absolute favorite ingredient which is one cup of molasses now you're going to beat this together just until it is fully incorporated and scrape down the sides to make sure that you've got everything thoroughly mixed now we're going to add in our flour and spice mixture I did it one spoonful at a time because otherwise I would make a giant mess but this is unnecessary you could do it in much bigger chunks than this once you've added all of the flour mixture I would again scrape down the bowl just to make sure everything gets incorporated and you don't have any dry bits at the bottom [Music] now this recipe will make about four dozen pretty good-sized cookies and I just do a heaping tablespoon as my portion size and this is a pretty soft dough but you should be able to roll it in your hands but if you find that it is impossible you can also put it in the refrigerator just for a couple minutes to kind of firm it back up now that we have our cookies rolled we're going to toss them in some granulated sugar to give them that classic sweet crust all around the outside of the cookie and this is what also gives them that really pretty cracked look after they're finished baking now this is completely optional but I like to take a small pinch of kosher salt or any sort of finishing salt and just do a light sprinkling over the tops these cookies it gives a really good salty contrast so that's super sweet crust that is on the outside of the cookies and this is also how I like to do my chocolate chip cookies and I will link that recipe video below now we're going to bake these cookies at 375 degrees one sheet pan out of time for nine to 11 minutes and rotate these halfway through but just look how beautiful these are and you can just see that tiny sprinkling of kosher salt there at the top but just look how pretty these are guys you want to be super careful not to over bake these cookies because if they are over baked they will turn hard like a gingersnap [Music] now just look how beautiful these are nice and gooey and chewy in the middle with a cup of hot tea or a cup of coffee these are simply amazing if you enjoyed this video please remember to hit the like button and of course subscribe to my channel and leave me a comment down below enjoy everyone", "BrfxvAzgTtI": "when it comes to christmas we all love cookies and there are literally so many different types of christmas cookies and anything can really be your tradition and what you make every year and it's delicious for me and my family we have a lot of cookies of course and one of my favorites that grandma made was a crinkle ginger cookie or a ginger crinkle cookie which just means it's a ginger cookie that has molasses in it of course and then it really as it bakes it kind of comes down falls out a little bit and then really gets a crackly crinkly top on it and that is what i love a delicious ginger flavor a soft but crisp cookie that's what we're gonna make and it's pretty simple here so in it what we're gonna start with is a fat like any cookie and no this is not butter what is this this is lard and yes you can still buy lard in grocery stores and the thing is i think lard has a bad name it's no different than fat as far as butter goes so fat is fat it's a fat butter is a fat large is a fat and if you get a good lard in the supermarket like a leaf lard it's going to be a pure lard and so it's not going to have a smell so don't be worried about it so to that lard which does bake i think extremely well in these cookies we're gonna add some molasses i love it think of it like a honey but it's thicker and it's it's more it's not just like sweet it has a kind of like a balanced out flavor because it has almost slightly bitter tones but not so much that you notice once it's baked up and that's really what gives any traditional or old style ginger cookie it's really good ginger look i love the molasses in a cookie then we're gonna put in some brown sugar i think again that just plays well to the color of the cookies but also it adds that kind of chewy caramelly texture of the cookie and i think that's really important so we're going to put all those ingredients together now unlike normal cookies where you cream just the butter and sugar brown sugar never creams quite like that so we're gonna mix it up we have those mixed together pretty well and now we're just going to add an egg this is what i love about especially older cookies is they're pretty simple and that's because back when they made them they didn't have just any ingredients at their fingertips they used what they had a lot of they had a lot of molasses because usually they made it themselves they had eggs because they raised hens you know all those things so once that egg is worked in we're going to just add our dry ingredients so flour is of course the most important thing sometimes in a cookie so we're going to scoop it in overfill it and then just swipe it off if you pack it in there by scooping it directly into your measuring cup you oftentimes put way more flour in than you need so it's really a lot better if you can just put it into it and it kind of is like acting like a sifting when you do this so that's that's why it's always better put in our flour then we're gonna put in some baking soda baking soda a lot of times it's used with molasses it reacts with it and it also is just helps you know brown and caramelize those cookies too and then it of course has some spices ginger number one because they are a ginger cookie so you want to make sure you know and this is one of those things at christmas check your spices if they're really outdated it's probably a good time to update because this is where your flavor's coming from and they are usually oil soluble which means a lot of their flavors are from the oils that are in them so we're putting in some cinnamon and we're finishing it off with just a little bit of clove not a lot because it does overpower just a little bit and then of course some salt you need that salt in there it balances everything out it's more needed than you think it's just a little bit but it goes a long ways so we're going to mix this in trying to start slow at first notice how i turn the bowl if you're using a hand mixer it just kind of makes sure that you're getting all of it mixed in i didn't feel like dirtying my big mixer it's just easier okay i don't like to over mix my cookies because they can get tough it makes them a little bit more coarse a little bit more dry so instead if anything i under mix them just give it a final pass here and make sure it's all mixed together so i'm going to clean this up we're going to assemble the cookies with a few extra things that make them i think extra special and give them kind of that that christmas edge which is going the extra mile to assemble the cookies i'm finishing up just chopping some crystallized ginger now this might not be something you just have in your pantry i happen to keep it in my pantry because if you have it there's fun ways to use it it's a ginger punch but what it is is literally real ginger that they candy so they boil it in sugar and then they coat it in sugar and so it's just like this really kind of gummy almost like candy but it has a real ginger punch and what i like to do you can incorporate it right into the dough i instead like to put it on top and so it gives you this kind of fun great crackly top texture so to make the cookies you make a nice scoop to make a good sized cookie you roll it around in your hand i mean that's a i like a i like a good size cookie it's christmas and then instead of rolling it in just regular sugar i put it in turbinado sugar or sugar in the raw it's these big crystals of sugar and so they really as they bake they they don't melt they just kind of stay like they are and stay really crystally and i love that i think that just makes a beautiful crackly shiny crispy sugary top and it's just completely different i think at christmas we go the extra mile usually if you go a little bit farther and make something extra special any cookie becomes something special for the holiday so in the top i just press in a few pieces that crystallized ginger you don't have to go crazy on it because it is strong and so it's just kind of enough to make a little bit of a extra topping and give you that flavor punch and don't worry you will taste it so i'm going to finish out this pan and we're going to pop them into the oven i'm finishing off just with the last cookie i give them plenty of space because they do spread out they're a nice big kind of flat cookie so i'm gonna pop it into the oven and i the thing i like about these cookies is you like them to get just crispy around the edge and still stay kind of soft and chewy in the middle so we're gonna bake them i'm gonna put the other pan together and we're just gonna it feels like christmas in here and soon it's gonna smell like christmas and the last panda to bake as you can see this just makes a few pans which is to me perfect because they're a beautiful sized cookie so i think for christmas especially i love to put these in christmas boxes with candies and other cookies and kind of just have all your little things that you're making and put together in a box and look how these present these are the ones that i pulled out of the oven let them on the pan for about five minutes to cool and then i just put them off onto a cooling rack you leave them on the pan for a little bit because they continue baking then you put them off so they can cool and look they're crispy on the outside do you hear that and then what i love about this look at the crinkly crackly top within that shiny pieces of that turbinate sugar the ginger so people know what type of cookie they are oh they still just break open beautifully so they're like crispy chewy hmm so good i love how a cookie can evoke and just like a flavor like take you right back to some of your favorite christmases and memories that's what this does to me it is delicious it's spiced just right a little bit of that cinnamon the ginger but then you get that molasses and the brown sugar so it has those chewy notes in the middle there's that delicious sugar on the outside these are such a fun treat for christmas and i think they're fun because a lot of people have memories of them and if they don't they're going to create new memories with them so i hope you love this recipe as much as i do and start a new tradition with it as always what helps me the most is when you share these videos around and it helps because it shows so many people that these recipes are so easy and fun to follow and i think it is a great year for us all to start a new tradition so i hope you enjoy it i hope it adds to your christmas because we all need a little bit of christmas right try the recipe share it check wiseguide.com for this recipe and more great recipes and as always just get in the

sticks we will use the rest of this one tonight for supper isaac's home and he brought a buddy so we will definitely be using the rest of that as supper all right to that i'm going in a third of a cup of white sugar and we're going to reach in here and get a third of a cup of packed brown sugar a third of a cup and we're going to turn that on and we're going to let that beat for about two to three

in with a little bit of vanilla i'm going to scrape down the sides and then begin to add in our dry ingredients okay guys i'm going to turn it on the lowest setting because i don't want to throw flour all over my kitchen although it would smell really good with all these spices in it and i'm just going to put one scoop in at a time so all right let's go in with all of it we'll turn it back up for just a notch get everything incorporated i'll scrape down the sides again [Music] be sure i don't have any flour left on the sides and then we'll be ready to scoop there's flour at the top of this

remove the brown butter from a saucepan and allow it to cool to room temperature before using in a mixing bowl add two cups of all-purpose flour one and a half cups of sugar one teaspoon of baking soda and one teaspoon of salt now whisk all the ingredients together and this will also aerate the flour now we're gonna prepare our wet ingredients once the butter has cooled you'll add one egg and one egg yolk 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon of dark molasses now with all the ingredients together now add your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients mix until it becomes a dough as you mix the dough will get thicker so you may have to swap out equipment I had to grab a rubber spatula for this part just continue to mix until your dough becomes uniform in color once you've finished mixing the cookie dough we're gonna add 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips now mix in your chocolate chips once you've worked in all the chocolate chips let your dough set for at least five minutes I will be using a tablespoon of dough per cookie make small balls out of the cookie dough and place on a cookie sheet have your oven set to 350 bake and these need a total cook

molasses cookies yay now this recipe like all good cookie recipes begins with two cups of regular all-purpose flour and we're putting this in a medium sized Bowl into the flour we're going to add two teaspoons of baking soda not baking powder baking soda we're also going to add one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon and one teaspoon of ground ginger ginger is one of my favorite spices it's right up there with ground cardamom and we need three-quarters of a teaspoon of the ground cardamom cardamom has a beautiful floral scent I absolutely love it and finally we need one and a half teaspoons of kosher salt did I say one and a half teaspoons I meant just a half teaspoon kosher salt and we're going to whisk this together yeah this is one of those recipes that doesn't require any special equipment you do not need a standing mixer nor do you need electric beaters just regular household kitchen stuff there we go then on to the wet ingredients so we need another bowl and let's say I need to reposition on my ingredients here we go first up we need one large egg and we're going to whisk that with the same whisk we used for the dry ingredients we also need one stick that's half cop or 113 grams of melted and slightly cooled butter and to whisk that in then we add 1/3 cup of regular granulated sugar whisk whisk whisk and then we need some molasses because these are molasses cookies after all grab my measuring cup here's a little trick when you're dealing with a sticky ingredient like honey or molasses what you can do is spray your measure with nonstick vegetable spray and then we want to bring this up to 1/3 cup there we go and the nonstick spray will help these sticky stuff release itself go hang on I have to grab a spatula here it is when they get all that molasses in there you know what I don't think that vegetable spray works so well after all so scratch that little direction and then last ingredient 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar and that's just brown sugar that you've measured and then push down with your thumb to pack it you know and we whisk all of these ingredients together yeah this is very easy to do very quick I'm going to make sure there are no lumps from the pack brown sugar that looks good then we grab our dry ingredients we're going to ditch the whisk and trade it for a spoon and then we're going to add the wet ingredients to the dry and I have my spatula ready because we want to make sure to get all of the wet ingredients out of the bowl and then we're going to stir the two together just until they're combined did I mention that these cookies are downright addicting well they are you can't eat just one if you're like me you'll eat one dozen here we go I hope you're having fun watching me stir okay and the dough is going to get very thick so be sure to use a stout spoon and we are good to go you get the dough off the spoon and then this goes into the refrigerator for 20 minutes meanwhile let me turn the camera up yeah while the dough is chilling in the fridge adjust the oven racks to the upper third and lower third positions and then preheat the oven 375 degrees Fahrenheit we'll be back all right we're almost ready to form our cookies first take a small plastic bag and add about 1/2 cup of ordinary granulated sugar we're going to be rolling the cookies in the sugar before we bake them also take two baking sheets and line them with parchment paper all right here's our chilled cookie dough what we're going to do is rip off or tear off tablespoon size clumps of the dough and roll it between the palms of the hands here it is and then throw it in the bag of sugar and you can do Oh three or four maybe even five of the balls at a time throwing them in the sugar that is I'll do three for you give the bag a shake and then place the sugared cookies on the baking sheet and I'm going to press them down just a little bit so they don't roll around and you want to space the cookies about two inches apart and I'm going to finish I'll do a couple more for you roll fling roll smack roll bang shake and today's on the baking sheet your hands are gonna get pretty dirty while you do this but who cares I'm going to finish these off and then I'll be right back alright my cookies are formed and I put 12 cookies on each baking sheet giving me two dozen cookies bake the cookies until they puff and develop cracks in the top and that will take about ten minutes I think I forgot to tell you to rotate the baking sheets halfway through baking time if you're not using the convection oven if you're using convection you do not have to rotate the sheets okay now we're cookies have baked I'm going to let them cool on their baking sheets for five minutes and then I will transfer them to wire racks for further cooling and I wanted you to see the beautiful cracks in the surface of the cookies and oh boy if they really smell terrific you can really smell the ginger and the cardamom okay I have a confession to make I've already eaten three of the cookies they are tender crisp they are spicy and warm I think they taste like autumn sunshine so I hope you'll give this recipe a try I'll post a link to the printable recipe in the description box below and if you'd like to leave a comment please do so I love hearing from you please subscribe and I will see you very soon with another delicious recipe bye for now", "awRnAkaI2JU": "you today I made my mom's molasses cookies and if you've never had a molasses cookie from my mom she's been published in two cookbooks with this cookie and it's really a good one it's it's somewhere between a gingersnap and a really soft sugar cookies I'm going to add 3/4 cup of canola oil and 1/4 of a cup of molasses do that we're going to add a cup of sugar and 1/8 give you a mix then we're just going to add our dry ingredients we have two teaspoons of baking soda two cups of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of grated ginger the dry ginger a half a teaspoon of ground cloves 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of ground cinnamon mix it together now this recipe came from my mom she used to make this and it kind of sounds weird no molasses cookies I don't know how appealing it sounds but my older sister had a restaurant and she put this on the menu and I swear it was like one of those things that put a couple of our kids through college I think it's really good it's a really good recipe ok you just want to mix it just till it comes together and then what we're gonna do is I'm just gonna go ahead and scrape this down here I'm gonna stick it in the fridge for about a half-hour 45 minutes just to let it firm up a little bit and then we'll be right back what I'm doing is I'm just portioning out a dozen cookies and I use this little device it just makes it easier and then what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna roll them in balls and toss them into some sugar put them on my cookie sheet when I finish this and then bake it in the oven at 275 degrees for about 20 minutes and that is the key to making these cookies you need to do it at 275 okay it's been 20 minutes I'm just going to put the cookies on it good let them cool the smell is amazing you can smell the ginger and allspice and cinnamon these are really good cookies they're not like Ginger Snaps they're gonna be very soft in texture where Ginger Snaps are kind of crispy these are soft it's kind of like if you took a gingersnap and you married it with a very soft sugar cookie they're very unique good I'm gonna take a little bite really good mmm it brings me back to my childhood so good", "T0GFZNkYQmE": "hello everyone welcome to walks with holly if you are here for the first time i am holly and i am a housewife and mom of four kids and i am so excited for the christmas season because that means christmas cookies that means baking some of our favorite sweets and treats that you just don't feel like any other time of year but the christmas season so i have a whole bunch of traditional cookies that we make this time of year and i want to share a few of them with you so today i'm going to be sharing with you our chewy spiced cookies before i get into the kitchen if you have not already subscribed to my channel please hit that subscribe button right now and help my channel grow i have a lot more cooking videos on the way for the holiday season and i wouldn't want you to miss a single one so anyways let's get in the kitchen right now and check out chewy spiced cookies here's all the ingredients i will be using today so i'm just gonna go through all the ingredients here i'm gonna be using unsalted butter one egg all-purpose flour white sugar ground nutmeg ground cloves ground cinnamon baking soda sea salt and my key ingredients molasses so i'm going to get my kitchenaid out here and first mix up one stick of unsalted butter and then i'm going to add 3 4 cup of sugar to this and i'm just going to mix this up until it just gets all fluffy and creamy and it takes about three minutes usually of mixing until it looks just like this next i'm going to add my egg and first i'll beat it separately in another little bowl and then i'll add the egg and mix for probably another two minutes until everything is well incorporated and then i'll go ahead and take my spatula here and scrape out the bottom and make sure nothing's stuck to the bottom then i'm going to mix my flour in a separate bowl first i'm going to sift it so it's going to be one and a half cups of flour and i like to sift it just to break it up better and i live in high altitude so i like heaping spoonfuls but one and a half should probably be enough next i'm going to add my spices first i'm going to add half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg a half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a fourth teaspoon of ground cloves and i'll just mix up the spices with my flour and then i'm going to add fourth a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of baking soda and then i'll just go ahead and mix up everything all my dry ingredients and mix them in with my wet ingredients and then i'm going to be adding my molasses it's going to be a fourth a cup of molasses i have this great cup from pampered chef that really gets it out of there so we'll just go ahead and mix the molasses with everything else until it is all incorporated real well together and then i'm going to just transfer it to another bowl totally optional and with my scooper here i'm going to scoop out it's about a tablespoon each and i'm going to roll these into little dough balls and just put them on some wax paper so about a tablespoon each for each dough ball and then you can put these in the fridge for maybe a half hour if you want and then we are going to get our pan ready i like to use parchment paper you can probably just grease the pan if you want to but i like the parchment paper better and then i'm just going to roll my dough balls into some sugar here and i don't really measure out the sugar i just kind of eyeball it but you can see how much sugar i'm using there so i'm going to set my oven to 350 and once all my dough balls are covered in sugar and placed on the pan i'll go ahead and put them in the oven and then we're going to let these cook at 350 for nine to ten minutes and once that time is up and you will know they're done when they crack at the top there see how they're all cracked on the top and this is exactly how you want the cookies to look and if you followed the directions they should come out just like this so i'm gonna go ahead and transfer my cookies to a cooling rack and i like to just take the parchment paper here and just slide it on over to the wire cooling rack and just let these set a little bit to room temperature and these ones here are room temperature and they are super chewy and delicious so i'm gonna just break one open right now and show you just how soft and chewy they are see look at that and these will stay chewy for a couple days several days but if you want to keep some fresh i would recommend after they're fully at room temperature put some in the freezer and if you want to try making these cookies yourself the full recipe will be in the description box below okay well that was my recipe for chewy spiced cookies and as you can see it was a pretty easy recipe and trust me they always come out that beautiful so i hope that you enjoy

Kitchen ultimately I learned that cooking at home is better so today we're cooking molasses spice cookies from America's Test Kitchen and it just happens to be Jack bishops favorite cookie first we're gonna preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit next up you want to weigh your flour eleven and a quarter ounces a teaspoon of the baking soda we had a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon a teaspoon and a half of ginger 1/2 teaspoon of ground clove 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and then finally 1/4 teaspoon each of ground black pepper and salt we just want to whisk this up until it's all incorporated and together next up in your stand mixer you're gonna want to put in 12 tablespoons of unsalted butter 2 and 1/3 ounces each of dark brown sugar and to our third ounces of granulated later sugar but this obviously means we must incorporate a little bit [Music] and slowly when I had the flower and I say slowly I mean nice gentle taps you put them into a half cup of sugar and you're gonna want to put 12 of these balls about two inches apart away from the rims from each other we're gonna do 12 cookies perceived and out with 24 cookies and now we think okay it's been 12 minutes and what you're looking for is you want to make sure that the edges are set you see the nice cracks put them onto a rack leave them in the sheet pan and let it cool for at least 10 minutes and that is how you make molasses spice cookies [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "XNmjr8AQZbk": "hey guys it's ro welcome back to my channel today I'm hanging out with two amazing people you guys may recognize candy she's made for me

"[Music] [Applause] hi there my name is rebecca marola and i'm one of the co-owners of function junction when things start to cool off i start to think how am i going to spend my time inside as opposed to being outside and one of the favorite things i like to do is bake it's something that my mother taught me how to do when i was little and it's something that we enjoyed doing together not only did my mother share her love of baking with me but i was on facebook the other day and i saw my little brother who has a toddler of his own and by the cookie sheets and the little pinch bowls of water and sugar laid out i knew that they were making my mom's molasses cookies so that makes me feel really good that that tradition is going to be passed down to another generation so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to add my sugars shortening an egg another trick this is why i love baking with my mother if you spray the inside of the measuring cup that i'm going to use for molasses with a little bit of cooking spray when i pour the molasses in it will release from the cup and i won't leave most of my molasses stuck in the measuring cup and i'm going to pour that in so we're going to stir this up with a mixer and we're gonna beat it until it's creamy okay i'm gonna set this aside for now and i'm gonna switch to my dry ingredients so the next thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna add our flour these are the measuring cups they're biodegradable then they will break down into the environment and i won't have to worry about plastic or metal or anything um unnecessarily taking up space yay health healthy environment the other thing i really like this is a progressive um flower keeper and it's got this handy little bar so i can just dip in and then drag it across the bar okay so i've got my flour and now i'm going to add baking soda and salt [Music] and my spices now one of the things that i like to do differently from the traditional recipe is i like to up my spices and one of the ways i do that is i use saigon cinnamon now we do carry this at function junction saigon cinnamon has so much more flavor than a regular cinnamon so i've got my dry ingredients in the crock i'm going to mix them up with this dough whisk i'm so excited about this also it's new from oxo you know from oxo that they have the um soft grip handles that are ergonomic they make holding onto handles really easy because it feels good in your hand and now i'm going to take my wet ingredients and i'm going to add those in and i'll do a little at a time and you can see how that dough whisk just really gets in there and integrates those ingredients okay so i'm gonna work around you can see that my dough is starting to come together if i'm gonna bake i'm gonna have to eat the cookies or the goods that i bake and if i'm gonna eat the things that i bake then i feel like it's best for me to use hand tools as opposed to power tools therefore working off some of the calories that i'm going to ingest by eating the baked goods that's my rationale so our cookie dough has been chilling for about two hours you'll see that i've got it kind of all collected up onto one side i did that on purpose before i put it in the fridge so that when i use my cookie scoop i can press against the side of the bowl and it just makes it a lot easier so i'm using a number 60 and this which is a pretty standard cookie scoop size this recipe makes exactly two dozen cookies using a number 60 scoop so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna scoop the cookie dough against the side like so and then i'm gonna place it on the sheet and i'm not gonna really mess with that much okay i like the little um texture that that kind of shows but we're going to do something with these once i get them scooped out now i'm going to place them about three inches apart on my cookie sheet the cookie sheet i'm using today is an insulated um cookie sheet by nordic ware i absolutely refuse to bake cookies on anything but an insulated baking sheet okay this is my favorite part and this is why i knew that my brother david was showing his son how to make my mom's molasses cookies because he had a little dipping bowl of sugar and a little dipping bowl of water now what we're going to do is we're going to pick up each one of our little balls and we're going to dip the top in sugar and we're going to place it back on the cookie sheet i'm going to take two or three fingers i'm going to dip them in the water and i'm going to touch the tops of the cookies so what that does is help promote that crinkle top in your finished product and you'll get a little bit of water on your cookie sheet don't worry about that it will bake off evaporate in the oven [Music] there you go we're gonna bake these at about 375 for around 10 minutes don't like to over bake them because i like them to be a little bit chewy and there's the buzzer so here we have our beautiful molasses cookies now i'm going to let them sit on the um cookie sheet for about two minutes if you try to transfer them to a cooling rack before that a lot of times the bottoms will um will be damaged you'll notice that the tops have a nice crinkly crust that will drop slightly as they cool [Music] i have really enjoyed this little trip down memory lane i hope you have too the cookbook that my mother used when i was growing up was this betty crocker cookbook and it is the basis for the recipe that i shared with you today it is something that i will treasure forever because it was something that i did with my mother and it was

sugar egg and the molasses so let me educate you a bit about molasses molasses is the third boil of sugar contains lot of nutrients and it's very very good for you it's got a little bittersweet flavor

subscribe to India Food Network we look forward to your views and comments you", "ryB8huzp4b8": "hi everybody welcome back to my channel I'm Cherie today we're going to be making chewy molasses ginger cookies using the candied ginger that we made in the last video don't worry if you didn't watch it I'll go ahead link it down below or if you already have candied ginger I'm sure you can buy it but it's easy to make as well ginger once again it has like amazing properties for anti-cancer anti-nausea so it's really nice to have these cookies because a really nice spicy sweet treat to have around so now we're going to take our candied ginger I know this looks like corn flakes but we're gonna take our candied ginger and we're gonna mince up into a mini little pieces alright that's about good enough alright for the dry ingredients I'll have all the measurements listed down below but you want to take your flour some baking soda cloves cinnamon and salt and mix it together if you also feel the need go ahead and add your ground ginger here if you want it I'm not going to because I have my fresh ginger so I'm go ahead and give this a good mix all right we're gonna go ahead and cream our butter and then slowly add in all the other wet ingredients which I'll have all the measurements listed below now we're gonna skip out a little bit and roll it into a ball oops all right it's good of abolishing again and then we're gonna roll it around a little bit of sugar just plain old white sugar and place it on a piece of parchment lined cookie sheet and press it down just the date of it that's it once you have your cookie sheet filled you're gonna put it in an oven that's been preheated to 350 for about 8 to 12 minutes I would check it just to make sure it doesn't overcook because if the longer it's in there the crispy are they'll get so if you want to chewy your cookie I would stick about the eight nine maybe ten minute more.if depending on your oven so these cookies have baked for roughly ten minutes and as soon as you take them out of the oven on your parchment sheet onto a cooling rack or they will actually continue to and once they're fully cooled enjoy", "EhiNaVsLM2k": "I'll start things off with the fundamentals showing you how to make gingerbread cutout cookies this is a basic rolled cookie dough so I have to start with butter half a cup and I find it tidier and easier to measure by weighing so 1/2 a cup of softened butter is also 4 ounces by weight 4 ounces on the nose this on the mixer now for the sweetness I start with 3/4 of a cup of dark brown sugar it's nice and moist to call a gingerbread Gingerbread it has to have two elements in common that's a fragrant blend of spices and the use of molasses when I bake desserts with molasses I used fancy molasses this is mild and taste and has a gentle sweetness the acidity within it activates the baking powder and baking soda so before I measure my molasses into the cup and it's a 1/2 cup measure little tip is to actually rub your measuring cup with a little vegetable oil this will allow the molasses to slip out easily and I'll add that in with the butter and sugar and with the paddle beat this until it's light and fluffy I love that caramel fragrance that molasses even just beating it with the spotter if the fragrance comes through and really gingerbread is all about the fragrance I'll add my eggs one at a time while I'm mixing the dough there we go the two eggs are nicely blended and now for the dry ingredients use all-purpose flour three and a quarter cups then I need to measure baking powder and baking soda just to give the cookies a little bit of lift half a teaspoon each and as well half a teaspoon of salt and now for that fragrant blend of spices this is an Indian spice dub or dhaba I use it to hold all my baking spices because it keeps them airtight and distinct so I'll start with the ginger of course so a full tablespoon of ground ginger since I want ginger to be the lead flavor in the spice blend I just have half a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of allspice give this a sift it's too light in the flour but also to start integrating the spices evenly into the flour add this all at once and I simply mix it until the dough comes together and there we go it's almost paste like it's so soft so I have to chill it down before I can roll out the cookies I'll shape it into two disks right these are ready for the fridge you want to let the dough chill for at least an hour to set up the butter I have a batch that has already chilled even after setting it still is rather soft and pliable so a little bit of flour on your work surface a little bit on the dough itself as I roll I rotate the dough just to make sure it's not sticking now a little bit of pulling away of the dough is to be expected and you just pinch it together and keep rolling then roll the dough to less than a quarter inch thick and now for the cutouts I've got a parchment lined baking tray you can cut out whatever shape you wish I'm gonna do a combination of nice diamonds as well as a fluted round this recipe makes about four dozen cookies and you can see how easily they cut and lift they're not overly delicate after I finish this tray of diamonds I'll do a full tray of the fluted circles something I particularly like about this gingerbread cookie recipe is how the dough rerolls so nicely so you can use every little bit I've got my full tray of the fluted rounds a full tray of the diamonds and these take 15 to 18 minutes in a 350 oven which I've already preheated [Music] there we go beautiful I like to let my gingerbread cookies cool completely on the tray before I lift or do anything with them and I think for these just a simple dusting of icing sugar is all they need just a light little dusting alongside a cup of coffee or tea this crispy yet tender little cookie is just an absolute treat", "_Rkqjimgef8": "hey everybody welcome back to my bake like a pro and YouTube channel in today's really fun video we are going to be making some amazing gingerbread cookies these are super soft and I'm gonna coat them with some nice sugar on the top you're gonna try this recipe once and you're gonna want to make it all the time so let's get started with the ingredients 2 cups of all-purpose flour this is 300 grams 1 cup of granulated white sugar this is 210 grams 3/4 of a cup of vegetable shortening and this is equal to exactly 171 grams if you don't want to use vegetable shortening you can substitute this for butter 4 tablespoons of molasses and this is equal to 72 grams 1 large egg and I always use large eggs in all of my recipes 1 teaspoon of salt that is 5 grams 2 teaspoons of baking soda 10 grams 2 teaspoons of baking powder 10 grams 1 teaspoon of cinnamon 2 grams and our last ingredient 2 teaspoons of ground ginger this is 5 grams so that's it for the recipe ingredients let's get started for my first step all of my vegetable shortening into the bowl and then we'll add in our granulated white sugar get my trusty old KitchenAid lift this up using the beater attachment and now I just want to cream this together so that's about one minute of mixing and you can see that the sugar and the vegetable shortening are starting to combine what I'll do now is I'm gonna add in my one egg and that is really gonna help with the creaming process so just let that go for about one more minute so that's about another minute of mixing not even and I turned my mixer from speed one up to speed three just to get that stuff really well mixed together the next thing I'm gonna add is my molasses now if you find your molasses is not runny enough you can just heat it up in your microwave for about 10 seconds and that will let it flow out of your little container much easier now I'll just turn this on and mix that in just turn your mixer up a little bit to get it all in there okay that's good so now we're gonna get all of our dry ingredients in I have my all-purpose flour in some countries that is called plain flour it's exactly the same thing or dried ginger cinnamon salt and if you are going to use butter and you're using salted butter you can omit the salt in my recipe baking powder and baking soda and that's it and then we're just gonna simply get all of this in there alright at the end you can just take your fingers and just push all of that through now we'll get this back onto our KitchenAid mixer and we'll start mixing get our paddle back on and then we'll just slowly start mixing a speed number one [Music] and you can see how quickly this has come together it's a speed number one I'm just gonna increase this just to get it off the paddle and that is it for the recipe the only thing that we're going to be doing later on we are going to be adding a little bit more white granulated sugar to the top of the cookies it's an optional step but it's worth it so now I'm just going to clean up for a second and then I'll come back so here we are again last step fun step let's get started I want to let you know right now I have my oven preheating to 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius I've got a cookie scoop here and to make this easy I just grab push up against the side to flatten it and then just pop it out just like that I've got some regular granulated white sugar and then you can just take the sugar and just get it on there just like that and that is it and then just place it down do another one and these will spread out a little bit so don't crowd your pan just get that on there and this is optional if you don't want to do this step you don't have to you can try some with the sugar and some without but these are amazing some scoop push against the side to flatten it there you go just like that and then down so I'll continue on I'll be back in a second and my last one that looks pretty good and I've just repositioned them because I want to make sure that they all have ample space when they start growing in the oven so at this point these are going into the oven 10 minutes at my 350 degree Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius oven I'll bake these off I have a little bit left I'm gonna finish these off and then we'll come back and we'll finish off the video hey everybody I am back and I have baked all of my cookies I have a total of 29 amazing cookies here all of them done exactly 10 minutes at that 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 and 80 degrees Celsius so I'm gonna take one from the second batch that I baked it is cool now and the only real way to test the cookie is to make sure that it's cool if it's warm it's going to be a little bit more soft but I want to take one that's cool just to show you how nice these are and let's break into this look at this watch this amazing oh my of course when I go in for a little bite hmm I cannot tell you how good these cookies are you have to try them make them once guaranteed you're gonna fall in love so all these are baked

"hey everyone its Meaghan Roosevelt your healthy grocery girl is registered dietitian and you're watching the healthy grocery girl show today we're making cookies and I'm sharing with you how to make a dark chocolate salted molasses cookie it tastes probably even better than it sounds it's so good and this is one recipe of 15 in my new and improved healthy holiday dessert guy this is a resources that I have put out every year I create this every year and updated add more info too and Admiral recipes and this year the healthy holiday dessert guide includes 15 vegan dessert recipes tips for baking gluten-free as well as a brand suggested grocery shopping list with baking items so all the items that I like to use for baking are included in that guy and this is one of the recipes I'm going to share with you today isn't that guy so it's up for sale as of today on the shelf healthy grocery bro calm go check it out let's get started with this recipe so to begin we're going to add in some sugar and I'm using coconut sugar and coconut sugar is great because it's lower glycemic it contains vitamins and minerals at calcium and magnesium and you know teaching loaded glycemic sugar is a helpful help manage our blood sugar levels which we all should do so here we have 1 cup of coconut sugars or just going to add that into our Bowl next we're going to add in half a teaspoon of salt then we're going to add two teaspoons of almond extract and this just smells so heavenly and it just adds a really fun flavor to these cookies and then we're adding in one teaspoon of baking soda so just toss that in and then we're going to add in one tablespoon of molasses now Lois this is great because it does I add calcium and iron shoot your cookies and it really just adds its rich decadent flavor and you can see just how thick this molasses is so good so we're going to add one tablespoon into our cookies it almost looks like a dark chocolate syrup it's just that decadent and then we're going to add in one cup of organic unrefined coconut oil this is going to act as the butter in the recipe and then we're just going to stir everything together until it's evenly combined next we're going to add in one flax egg now this is alternative to a traditional egg and to make this it is one tablespoon of ground flaxseed with three tablespoons of water and you just bind that together let it sit for a couple of minutes and you're going to give this really gelatinous consistency and so we're going to add that into our mixture here then we'll just mix the flax egg into our molasses sugary coconut oily batter here and then we're going to add in our flour so I'm using organic whole wheat pastry flour from Bob's Red Mill and if you're wanting to make this recipe gluten free as mentioned the healthy holiday dessert guide has tips for baking gluten free so you can make this recipe wouldn't worry if you would like but I'm going to just use traditional whole wheat pastry flour so I measured up to tops and then we're just going to slowly add this flour in it to our mixture I didn't give it a stir we'll just keep doing this until we've added all of the flour now you can do this in an actual mixer or using something like a KitchenAid I actually don't own a KitchenAid mixer that may be on my kitchen item wish list but I find that you can still make all of these recipes and all the recipes in my dessert guide even if you don't have you know the fancy equipment you can still make everything by hand and it's a nice arm workout too once you've mixed everything together then we're just going to add in our chocolate chips and I'm using organic just chocolate chips I love dark chocolate and dark chocolate contains flavonols which help improve blood circulation and they're really good for heart health so not only is this recipe delicious but right there's a lot of wholesome ingredients s are just really even nourishing our body and providing it with a lot of nutrients yum this cookie no matter looks so good and the fun thing about baking vegan cookies is there's no raw eggs so you can enjoy eating some of the cookie dough batter okay so for America's gonna add them onto our baking sheet so I'm going to clear some space in our book now I'm going to love the invisible snazzy device here this was a gift from one of my aunts and it's so you put the cookie dough batter into this little device and like that make sure you get it in nice and good and then I have to do is just drop it on to your baking sheet you just push this little this little button and I think that you can find these at just your local store that sells home goods base where you probably get these online something like Amazon so they're all over but it's great so we're just going to add all of our cookie dough onto the baking sheet and then we're going to throw this in the oven at 375 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes and your house is gonna smell amazing and you're gonna have this just delicious dark chocolate salted molasses cookies our cookies have finished baking and they smell so amazing I'm going to transfer these onto a wire rack and let them cool

making some pumpkin molasses cookies um i'm gonna just jump right in and we will get started the first thing you just want to make sure is that before you get started just take your one stick of butter if you're doing a single batch out of the refrigerator for about an hour so just to warm up that way it's easier to work with with your mixer or if you're mixing by hand but we will just jump right in all right so to start with i have our mixer with our paddle attachment on it i'm going to just add our stick of softened room temperature butter and we're just going to blend this up and we are going to gradually add in our granulated sugar molasses and our pumpkin puree as well now if you have egg issues like an egg intolerance you can't have your eggs this is a recipe that does not have eggs as well as could easily be substituted to have gluten-free all-purpose flour used which would make these a great gluten-free option for a nice fall dessert alright so we are going to jump right in and get this mixing and get our next ingredients added [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do [Music] all right so now we are just going to scoop out our cookies you can either use a spoon and roll these by hand or i am using this one doesn't have a number on it this one is just a small portion scoop about small cookie size this will maybe about two tablespoons size so i'm just going to scoop it out if you have a scoop into your granulated sugar and then we are going to toss them and roll them which is why we're wearing gloves just so we don't make a mess and then i press them down when i bake them however you don't have to do that but you just want to make sure you get them coated in the sugar and then i roll them and this sheet tray there's a normal size cookie sheet will fit four by three so it will fit twelve [Applause] all right so now before these go in the oven i like to just press down gently with a fork i do one line rotate the fork and cross hatch them this just gives them a cool pattern when they come out of the oven and they're not as tall these do not spread very much in the oven so you do need to press them down somehow whether you press them with a fork or press them down with your fingers either way will work [Music] you", "Ccxz4t2r4KM": "[Music] good afternoon ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us we're cooking with

goes back generations grandma blues molasses cookies we'll have them all ready for frosting when Kate gets home from school these are quite possibly the best Christmas cookies ever to tempt old Santa Claus and engels has all the ingredients to make these wonderful holiday treats okay I've had one cup of shortening and one cup of sugar in the mixer for a few minutes just creaming those together to that I need to add my flour mixture and spices I've got some good cinnamon here some delicious ginger and just a little bit of salt and then we are going to add our wet ingredients we've got molasses here which looks a little funny but it has been mixed with a little bit of baking soda these old recipes kind of makes you wonder how they came up with all the ingredients my husband just absolutely loves these cookies and it's a wonderful family tradition to have my daughter participate in all right so we've got our molasses there we're gonna add sour milk to our mixture here and you want to keep the mixer on slow during this part because otherwise you will mess up your kitchen we're gonna wait until that's incorporated and then we'll start with the flatware mixture all right so we're getting close here in fact I'll just go ahead and stop this and get the rest of our dough in there so it doesn't go all over the kitchen there's our flour so you'll put that down mix it up for just another minute or so so our dough is all mixed it needs to rest in the refrigerator overnight I already have some of that pre-made for us so I'm gonna go grab that and we'll be right back okay so our dough is chilled in the refrigerator overnight and we're ready to roll it out on a floured surface we're gonna roll these cookies out to about a quarter of an inch thickness and we like to use all different Christmas cookie cutters my daughter just enjoys this so much all right got a gingerbread man how cute is that star and a Christmas tree that looks pretty good I'm going to go ahead and put this on our cookie stone and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes we'll be right back these just came out of the oven in the house smells incredible we love to frost these as a family you can do it in so many different ways with just the icing you can add eggnog to the icing to give it a little bit more holiday flavor and then use all different types of sprinkles and embellishments well we're all set thanks so much for joining me here at the Ingles table make sure and explore the site for more great tips and recipes see you next time [Music]", "DWdkciffG3U": "hi it's Maria from another world today we're going to make moist okumura which is molasses cookies and I'm making them gluten free so first we're going to start off with 1 cup of olive oil extra virgin Greek olive oil pour that in next we're going to need a half a cup of molasses and then next we'll need a half a cup of sugar and I'm using coconut palm sugar because it's healthier than using regular sugar but you can use whatever sugar you wish I just prefer to make it with the coconut sugar so half a cup of that pour that in might have to clean that out next we need a half a cup of orange juice now you can use freshly squeezed orange juice or if you have orange juice on hand and don't have time to squeeze fresh oranges just use half a cup or that in and let's give that a whirl it would help to plug it in first there we go next you'll need about two cups or more of gluten-free flour and I've used a mixture of flowers here as you can see in the layers there's some almond flour in there tapioca rice flour in sorghum flour so we're going to add a little bit of that at a time we'll also need a half a teaspoon of baking powder baking soda cinnamon and close and i'm going to add that to the flower i stir that all up and slowly add it in so now I've added another two cups of gluten-free flour to the mixture and now the computer was starting to form you want it to get to a consistency that is thick enough perform in to cookie so I would say about four cups or so of flour you want the dough to be able to be handled properly but it will still be a little bit sticky it's not too much make sure you scrape down the sides of the bowl too and then we're going to chill it in the fridge for about an hour that's the consistency that I'm going to want in this cookie that's that's pretty good okay so now that the dough has been chilled I'm going to take a boat at the table spoon or a heaping teaspoons out like this and I'm going to it's easy to handle as you can see so what I'm going to do is I'm going to roll it and because of the oil you don't need any flour to to to line the sheet with so then you'll notice that once you roll it out it becomes a long log I know it doesn't look very appealing but it actually tastes really good this is how my mom makes hers she rolls them out like that and then she makes little patterns like that again not visually appealing but they're very tasty you can make your cookies into shapes like this or what you can do is just make them into little drops the other option is to just roll out the cookie dough and use these cookie cutters to make shapes and now i'm going to put these in the oven at 350 for 15 to 20 minutes allowing space in between for them to spread out you", "3bZEaAuj3pw": "hi welcome to hot chocolate hits I'm medica and today I'm going to show you how to make ginger molasses cookies drizzled with caramel sauce these are very soft cookies and they're perfect for Christmas because they have all the necessary flavors and they look so so good so let's get started I'm gonna start off with three cups of all-purpose flour two which I'm gonna add some ground ginger ground cinnamon ground cloves nutmeg and some salt and also some baking soda and I'm just gonna add that into the flour and you just want to whisk it together until all the ingredients are combined then set that bowl aside I have your three quarters of a cup of softened unsalted butter which I'm just going to work slightly with my rubber spatula just to get it nice and creamier next I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of sugar I'm using a combination of brown sugar and regular granulated sugar and you just want to whisk it together to looks nice and fluffy and creamy and it resembles the color of spam then you want to add in one whole egg and just crack it right into the bowl and of course you're gonna add in some vanilla extract because vanilla gives such an aromatic fragrance to baked goods in general and then you just want to whisk the egg and the vanilla into the butter mixture and now for the real flavor of the cookie pour in 3/4 of a cup of molasses and just whisk it in until the batter becomes one consistent color I love the caramel resemblance now add in the flour in three batches so that the mixture doesn't splatter on your face and you just want to incorporate it ever so gently and you're after a beautiful mocha color dope now for the hardest part waiting pop the dough covered with cling wrap into the refrigerator for about an hour and this just makes the dough firm up a bit so it's easier to roll uncover the dough and form into balls take about two tablespoons of the dough in your fingertips and roll it into a ball then take that ball of dough and roll it in some granulated sugar this adds a nice sparkle to the cookies and then place on a parchment lined baking sheet around 2 inches apart with each ball and pop into a 350-degree oven for exactly eight minutes after exactly eight minutes you going to take a metal spoon and you're just going to press the tops of the cookies down and you can see that when you do this the cookie forms cracks and this gives the cookie such a rustic feel and the rustic look and I really like that personally so you can either keep it and do that or you don't have to so then pop the cookies back into the oven once you've done that for one more minute exactly then you want to take the cookies let them cool a bit and then place them on a wire rack to cool completely although these taste great warm as well and now for the final touch the cherry on top of the cupcake the caramel sauce I'm using some caramel sauce I bought at Marks & Spencer because it is so so good you can either melt your own caramels or make your own sauce then just place it into a piping bag snip off the end and then drizzle it on top of the cookie in a zigzag motion now just tell me what you love to receive these in your stocking on Christmas morning so now all that's left is tasting so I have one of the cookies here and I'm just gonna give it a taste just look at how soft it is it just breaks apart so easily not to mention the sugar adds such a nice glisten to it Wow that's my one word for it Wow and the caramel add such such a wonderful flavor to it just because I mean you have your cookie and then the caramel takes it to a new level I highly highly recommend this cookie for Christmas I took it to school and it was a big hit and everyone liked it and I like it because I don't make molasses cookies often so I really hope you give this recipe a try tune in next Sunday at 6

Let's get started. First let's sift together our dry ingredients. I am going to add 2 cups of flour here, and\nit is okay if it goes over the sides here, probably need a bigger sifter, one half teaspoon\nof salt, 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon, 2 tsp. of baking soda, one half tsp. of ground cloves,\none half tsp. of ground ginger.

Let's cream that together. Okay, then I am going to scrape the sides. And now I will add one egg, mix. Scrape the sides one more time. Then we just mix in our flour, and I am going\nto mix it in, about a third of it at a time. And then I will scrape the sides one last\ntime. All right and now we clean off the beaters,\nand then what I am going to do is I am going to take the dough and just ball it all together. And then what we want to do is cover this\nwith plastic wrap or a lid, and then chill this in the refrigerator, for at least two\nhours, on to that step. All right once you have them rolled out, this\ngoes into an oven that has been preheated to 375 degrees F. And then we will bake them\nfor 7 to 8 minutes.

cookies or molasses cookie it's all the same if you're new to my channel welcome don't forget to hit the subscribe button that way don't miss on upcoming videos in a large bowl i've added two sticks of butter which is around three-fourth of a cup and to this i've added one cup of sugar which is white granulated sugar i'm going to mix it well until it's nicely combined and almost creamy texture now i'm adding one room temperature egg and the molasses this is the molasses that gives this beautiful color and beautiful taste so make sure you add molasses you cannot replace molasses to this recipe i'm going to add the molasses and get all the molasses from the measuring cup and then i'm going to mix them until it's all well combined and you will see the color change so basically what happens some people add brown sugar to get the caramelized color but if you don't have brown sugar don't worry molasses gives us beautiful color anyways and i'm adding two cups of flour make sure you measure them nice and loose don't pack them tight one teaspoon cinnamon powder 1 8 of a teaspoon salt and 1 8 teaspoon cloves now cloves you make sure you add very little is overpowering so you don't want too much of it one teaspoon ground ginger if you don't have ground ginger definitely add fresh grated ginger 2 teaspoon baking soda now go ahead and mix them at a low speed using your hand mixer but if you don't want to use the hand mixer definitely you can use the spatula to just do it but do not over mix the batter i'm not gonna completely mix it with the hand mixer i'm gonna use my spatula to finish it off i definitely don't want to over mix my dough at this point i'm gonna just scrape down all the leftover dough i i'm gonna scrape down all the dough from the sides any flour that is not mixed well i'm gonna just mix it now with a spatula once it is well combined i'm gonna refrigerate at least for an hour if you can you can directly go ahead and start making the cookies that's okay as well this dough is very forgiving after an hour here i have brown sugar big crystals sugar if you don't have the brown sugar i'm going to show you the second method what to do in a bit i'm also preheating my oven at 350 and also line my porch baking tray with parchment paper now go ahead and scoop nice one to take two tablespoon of a dough any size of a ball would work since it's a christmas you can always make a bigger cookie than the regular smell of the cookies shape into a nice size bowl roll it into the brown sugar that's large crystal sugar and then i'm going to place it in the parchment paper now we want to make sure we place it in a way that is more space between each cookies definitely space it out because it is going to spread out if you're making a larger cookie probably you will not be able to put more than four cookies in a baking tray depending on the size of the baking tray now i'm going to add this crystallized ginger now if you want to add the crystal ginger in your cookie dough you can do that but i think it kind of overpowers so i would prefer and or i would suggest you can add them on top that way you have control how much you're going to add them and if you some if someone doesn't like it it's overpowering they can always remove it now i'm going to make this at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes depending on the oven temperature as you can see it's beautifully baked i'm gonna let it cool for five minutes before i transfer the cooling rack for the second method it's the same dough we are not doing any dough here all over for the second method all that we are doing is using powdered sugar instead of the brown sugar and we also not using the crystallized ginger now if powdered sugar is easily available if you don't you can always take your white sugar and powder it yourself and then you can actually roll it down and then place it in the parchment paper line in the cookie sheet again space it out so that they don't stick together and now i'm gonna bake this at 350 once again 12 to 15 minutes depending on the oven temperature you definitely want to make sure that you keep a check on it now once that is done again i'm going to let it cool down for 5 minutes before i transfer into a cooling rack now i'm going to show you guys look at that beautiful crust on the side it's nice and crispy and the center is nice and soft and the crystallized sugar that we added is not melted and it looks this beautiful shiny on top this is what i was looking for and i'm going to show you guys side by side the variation with one cookie dough if you can make two variations why not i hope you enjoy watching this video and i wish you a very happy and merry christmas and i will see you soon in my next video till then take care guys bye", "2-LO-f4rrJs": "hi I'm Susan from bake with mom calm today we're going to make soft chewy molasses cookies we're gonna sift our flour this is all-purpose flour we're going to except about two and a half cups worth but we're going to measure it after we've sifted it instead of doing two and a quarter cups I would prefer to measure it two and a quarter cups of flour is eleven and one quarter ounces I'm going to put the bowl on my scale and then I'm going to scoop my sifted flour until I get eleven and a quarter ounces to the floor I'm going to add a teaspoon or 1/2 of ginger and a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon I have one teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of cloves a quarter of a teaspoon of allspice a quarter of a teaspoon of pepper and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt we're going to add all of that to our flour we're going to whisk it together to blend it when a whisk this at medium-high scrape the bottoms and sides we're going to add a third of a cup of packed dark brown sugar make sure it's the dark it's nice and robust in flavor we're going to beat for about two minutes I'm going to add one large egg yolk just the yolk in a teaspoon of vanilla extract next we add a half a cup of robust molasses there is original and robust sold in the store try to get the robust scrape your sides again and the bottom next we're going to add our dry ingredients a little later time the heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna take a heaping tablespoon so it's a pretty big we're gonna roll it in our sugar this is that half a cup of sugar that we measured at the very beginning and place it on the cookie sheet place them about two inches apart six will probably fit out a cookie sheet because these are very large molasses cookies we're gonna put these in the oven for 11 minutes but halfway through the bake we want you to rotate your pan around and switch the top sheet to with the bottom sheet because we're going to do two at a time in the oven and that you want the tops done and the bottoms done evenly and so you'll have to switch the pans halfway through so I switch the pans I'm going to rotate them around and then do the rest of the baking time look gorgeous now to add a different texture to your cookie you could use raw sugar and then it would be have crackles of sugar on top instead of the granulated sugar melting into the cookie but it it looks pretty and it tastes good too hi I'm Susan with big with mom com subscribe to my youtube channel and you can learn to bake something new every Friday if you have a question about baking or cooking be sure to leave it below and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible", "dKeasltqhbE": "hey everyone welcome back to my kitchen i'm amy from neurotic mom bakes and i have the best recipe for you today uh probably one of my favorites but i feel like i say that all the time but this really is one of my favorites i love gingerbread ginger snaps gingerbread cake that's probably one of my favorite flavors so we're going to do my gingerbread cookies these are you can make these quickly you don't have to freeze the dough they are no spread they are thick and soft and fluffy here in america we love our cookies really soft i know that elsewhere they like the crispy ginger snap the crispy texture or other cookies they like them crispy but you got to try these really soft cookies because i prefer them they're they're delicious so let's get started i have my cookie cutters here i'm going to set that aside though and we'll work on the dough first thing you need is six tablespoons of unsalted butter [Music] and let's see quarter cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar and we're going to cream this together until it's nice and light fluffy there we go nice and light and fluffy we're going to add one egg and then i'm going to start measuring out a half a cup of molasses light or dark it doesn't matter richer flavor use the darker [Music] make sure to get all of that out that's done okay dry ingredients oh nope i forgot my one teaspoon of vanilla there we go i always eyeball i eyeball vanilla okay now for the dry ingredients um unlike my cakes i'm not gonna combine all the dry ingredients and then put them in because i'm going to show you a trick to get the perfect consistency and it has to do with the amount of flour just depending on the humidity the temperature of your kitchen you may need to adjust the flour amount just a hair but if you've combined them all together and you find that it's too sticky or are you yeah it's just gonna mess up the spice the spice measurements so let's we're going to add three cups of flour i'm going to only add half that amount for now and there's one and a half so i'm going to stop there just add half the flour and now i'm going to add all the rest of my dry all my spices and salt all that stuff so we're going to add a half a teaspoon of salt and then one and a half teaspoons of ginger there's a half there's one one and a half one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon half [Music] one and a half i'm going to stop the dough at this point while i finish adding my spices a half a teaspoon of cloves and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg once i've got everything else in i'm going to gradually add the flour and it's going to be about three cups but i'm going to keep testing the consistency you want the dough to be able so you can handle it without it sticking to your fingers but you also want it to hold together its shape and i will show you how to adjust that so we have one and a half cups of flour in there this makes two that's two and a half and get that all mixed together and just kind of see where my dough is at i'm also at this point going to scrape it down just to make sure i have all that off the bottom it will start to pull together as it gets to the right consistency i have another half a cup of flour to add but i'm going to add it very gradually let's test it pretty good still maybe a little sticky i think that would stick to your countertop i'm just going to add maybe another tablespoon okay that's just about right still a little bit sticky so if i see how it sticks like that we don't want that i am going to flour my surface but that's still just a tiny bit too sticky for me i'm just going to scrape these sides add a little more flour and it'll kind of start to clean the bowl it'll pull all the dough away from the sides of the bowl and form a ball i think that is just about right now if you find you've added too much flour don't panic your dough is not ruined add a tablespoon of milk at a time to get it the right consistency so if it's really crumbly and not holding together just a tablespoon mix it up check it add another tablespoon if you need to and we're good that is perfect so i ended up using not quite three cups of flour maybe a tablespoon or two less and we are ready to roll out our dough okay like i said the beautiful thing about this dough is it's no spread you can put those cookies really close together and get a lot on one pan generous amount of flour i like to press it down and then flip it over make sure we get lots of so we don't want it to stick there we go okay start rolling don't if you want a crispier cookie where it's just crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside then roll your dough thinner but if you want that thick fluffy soft cookie i would say that's 3 8 of an inch a little bit more than a quarter a little bit less than a half and then i will just get my cookie cutters let's do two mittens circles i love to have a small cookie cutter on hand because it gets all those places that you can't fit any other size and these are just like little snacks and then you can also fit them in between the bigger cookies on the tray let's do a candy cane i'm not gonna do the treat today i don't think because i'm giving these away to lots of neighbors now the trick to getting these to not to spread put them in your freezer for a minimum of 20 minutes you can go longer but minimum 20 minutes and they i guarantee they will not spread see how close together i'm putting these i love it because i can get like two full cookie sheets stick them in my ovens and be done let's roll this out again try not to handle it too much just as little as possible here's a trick i learned these cake benches cake scrapers really good scraping that stuff off i wanted to do one tree [Music] you don't need to wrap these or anything they just go in your freezer 20 minutes then in your oven at 375 degrees watch them it's about 8 to 11 minutes as soon as the center looks no longer wet or just a tiny tiny bit wet in the center because it'll continue to cook once you take them out then get them out it's hard to tell by color because they're already brown so you have to go by the centers will be kind of they'll look kind of wet and as soon as they stop looking wet it just take them out right away okay i'll put these in the freezer and then i'll put them in the oven all right here they are my finished gingerbread cookies they are thick and really soft to bite into you can decorate them with royal icing you can decorate with them them with buttercream you can eat them plain they're delicious however you look at it so let me know what you think of this recipe give it a try give me some feedback and if

tell whenever they get completely mixed um you don't see the egg yolk and you can't tell the difference between any of the ingredients so they're almost there then we're going to add in our dry ingredients which was the flour with our spices and baking soda and salt [Applause] now if you notice it's still a little bit gooey so depending on your weather you might need to add a little bit more flour to it so i think i'm gonna add just a little handful of the all-purpose flour into it just to make it think it's coming clean so i think it's ready okay now that we have our dough ready what we're gonna do is you needed to have an extra half a cup of sugar you might need more but keep that in a bowl and we're going to roll the dough into one inch balls and they get they get you spread out so a ball about like that and the size of my hand then we're just going to throw it into the sugar and cover it just like that and roll it all the way around to where it's covered then we're going to place it onto our cookie sheet and then what you're going to do for each cookie is you're going to flatten it down with just a flat surface now in between each time when you flatten it you might have to dip your measuring cup or whatever your thing is into the sugar so that it won't stick that's going to help your cookies be thin and crispy which is what we like i like to roll all of mine and then go back and flatten them right before i put them in the oven it just saves time and i'll go ahead and [Music] so [Music] okay i got one cookie sheet done and put in the oven preheated it to 350 and i've got the other one waiting to go in now we probably have enough dough to make two more um cookie sheets about three dozen cookies so we're gonna have to rotate them in and out because i don't have a lot of good cookie sheets so what you want to do is watch them for about 8 to 10 minutes you want to get them brown around the edge and if you like a softer cookie you can pull them out before they get brown but we like them a little crunchier so we're gonna let it get good and brown around the edge okay they look like this they're done you see how they're kind of brown around the edge i think that this batch is done so we'll put another one in so you can see the difference between i think i've smushed one in baked and then not baked so i'm going to let the cookies sit on their cookie sheet after i pulled them out of them for just a few minutes and then i'll transfer them to the cooling rack to let them completely cool before i pack them up okay i think they're cool so we're just going to transfer them to our cooling rack now they are cool enough that you don't really need this you can just pick them up but i'm going to just use it because you just want to be safe because you don't want any of them to bend tear but i think they have cooled enough to just lift them up okay so now that they're cooling i've got the other batch that's in the oven baking and as soon as those get out then i'm going to start rolling another batch to put in the oven i think that it should um get it between one more cookie sheet maybe two but um these cookies are great for christmas on thanksgiving you can give them away as gifts i know that we have given these away to our neighbors they're just the perfect cookie the spice in them is not as strong as gingerbread so a lot of people love that of course you're going to need a good molasses which we personally like our own but there are different kinds that you can buy in the store but anyway um they're the perfect cookie because they're crunchy and they're they're great with a glass milk so they're perfect for thanksgiving for a quick dessert are they perfect i can sometimes eat them for breakfast but don't don't tell anybody um but anyway they're a great cookie to give away at christmas time you just bag them up in a little pretty bag um so anyway try it let us know how you like them but um we personally they're our favorites [Music] okay i think that the second tray is almost finished let's check them out they are they're brown around the edge so i think it's time to put in our third dozen now be very careful whenever you use parchment paper it tends to slide so if you throw them into the oven pretty fast the cookies will go flying everywhere as i've done before so be very very careful you don't have to use the parchment paper you can spray it um with just your pam or whatever you use on your cookie sheet it doesn't matter but um anyway i just use the parchment paper because it's easy to clean okay now our second tray has cooled we're gonna put them onto the cooling rack and then i think we will be finished after this next tray now if you're making them about this size it is looking like it's going to be over three dozen now normally it makes about three dozen um depending on how big you make them determines on how many you're going to get out of the batch [Music] but if you're needing them to give them those gifts and you want to make them a little bit smaller you can roll them a little bit smaller and you'll get more now as i'm rolling this last um batch yeah i think it's the last one it seems like it goes on forever um the last little pan here i just wanted to tell y'all in a few weeks um if you follow us you will see us in mississippi at my parents house and we will be embarking upon

we all need a good ginger cookie this time of year so today I'm going to be teaching you how to make a healthy soft and chewy ginger cookie using just wholesome nutrient-rich ingredients and free of any gluten grains or wheat flours and free of any refined sugars or vegetable oils [Music] you [Music] let's get started by preheating the oven to 350 degrees and lining a cookie sheet with parchment paper first we need to combine the dry ingredients in your bowl add the almond flour coconut sugar ground ginger cinnamon nutmeg baking soda and salt start to combine everything and until there are no more lumps in the flour these are to use finely ground almond flour so that your cookies have a good texture in the end so now in a separate bowl add the butter honey and water and whisk this with a handheld mixer or a whisk add the egg and whisk again to combine [Music] if you can't have dairy you can also substitute the butter for ghee an organic palm shortening or even coconut oil to make this recipe dairy-free add your flour mixture to the bowl with the wet ingredients and using a spatula mix to form a dough and mix just enough to combine everything we don't want to over mix the dough cover with plastic and freeze the dough for 40 minutes to an hour so that it's easier to handle this recipe is posted on my blog and living healthy with chocolate calm so you can see all the ingredients that I'm using and you can also get the written recipe and I'll roll the chilled dough into balls and flatten each one slightly with the palm of your hands I'm using about one and a half tablespoons of dough per cookie here bake the cookies in your preheated oven for 10 minutes or until they start to turn brown then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool although we're using healthy ingredients here these cookies have an amazing taste and texture as good or even better than traditional ginger cookies these are the perfect healthy alternative for your celebrations this

try you'll need 450 gram flour travela 250 gram butter or my green and room-temperature turn it from tahini also known as sesame paste 80 gram of Greek molasses 180 gram sugar 1 egg separated 1 package of baking powder 1 package of vanilla sugar or just a bit vanilla extract 90 grams ground nuts of your choice we use hazelnuts but walnuts or almonds would work just as great its usual pinch of salt and sesame seeds on top I love these kinds of cookies as they are really easy to make you trust in your pinch of salt sugar nuts egg yolk molasses a little sugar baking powder butter and tahini in to the floor and just knit it thoroughly I could have just sat to trust all the ingredients inside from the egg white and sesame seeds but well that's just me when you have not this long enough you should be able to form some small bowls if the dough for whatever reason is still too soft just add another spoonful of flour and if the dough is too hard just add a bit of vegetable oil just be careful not to pour too much now you can whisk the a quite a bit and start forming a cookies I like mine the size of walnuts if you make them about that size this dough will yield about 40 to 45 cookies after we have formed the cookies I spread them with a bit of egg white and sprinkled the sesame seeds over them you can dunk the cookies directly into the sesame but then it just sticks too much which I don't want to have here when that's done kick these little suckers into the oven for about 180 degrees Celsius for about 10 to 15 minutes my oven was cold when I put them in so it took a bit longer and again know your oven if it seems like the cookies are done get them out don't let them go unsupervised well after these have cooled off you can enjoy them with a good cup of tea a puffy

not yet friends, Welcome back to Mary's Test Kitchen where\nwe're diving right into these easy vegan gingerbread cookies. They're so delicious with warming spices,\na bit tender on the inside with crisp chewy edges when they're fresh out the oven. And with super simple decorator's icing for\nall your fun designs; you're going to love them! As always the printable recipe is linked in\nthe description box with notes to make these the most perfect cookies for you. And for more easy vegan cookie ideas, I've  got a whole playlist linked there and in the cards. Let's start with sifting together the dry\ningredients. As always, I'm measuring out the flour by\nweight. But UNLIKE always, I won't harp on you to\nget a kitchen scale. If you just use the fluff, scoop and level\nmethod and maybe get a little extra flour in there, it'll be fine. This recipe is pretty forgiving. After the flour, add baking powder and this\nwill give the gingerbread cookies just the tiniest bit of lift so they have a nice texture\non the inside. Then come the spices. I love ginger so I'm using a whole tablespoon. Then cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Confession time: these spices are a year old\nso if yours are fresher, you might do with a little less than what I'm using. I just don't use a lot of cloves and nutmeg\noutside of the holiday season. What about you? I don't know why but I find sifting flour\njust really fun. But what it does is it helps get rid of any\nlumps that might be in your flour or your year old spices. That's it for the dry ingredients, now for\nthe wet. To bind the cookies, you'll need a vegan egg\nalternative. Today, I'm using aquafaba. That's the thick liquid from a can of chickpeas\nor white beans. Or you can make it yourself by cooking your\nown chickpeas or white beans. You can also use ground flax or chia with\nwater to make flax egg or chia egg. See the printable recipe for those measurements. But for if you're using aquafaba like I am,\nmeasure out 6 tablespoons. This is when I realized my mistake. Normally, I'd beat the sugar and vegan butter\ntogether first. It makes everything else easier to combine\nafterwards but I already have the aquafaba in the big bowl and I don't really want to\nwash another bowl so... Like I said, this recipe is pretty forgiving. I'm mix this in my stand mixer but if you're\nfeeling like a work out, you can totally do this by hand or you can use an hand held electric\nmixer. Next up, molasses. Prep your measuring cup with your vgean butter\nwrapper. A bit of grease will help that molasses come\nout cleaner. You can use this tip for measuring any kinds\nof syrups. I'm using fancy molasses will which give these\ngingerbread cookies that classic flavour. If you're not a big fan of the flavour of\nmolasses or you want to make something a bit milder tasting, you can do half molasses and\nhalf corn syrup or all corn syrup. These are your vegan gingerbread cookies and\nthere are no rules. But don't forget the vanilla extract. Now add the dry ingredients to the wet and\nstir to combine. Finally, you should have a smooth soft sticky\ndough. It's almost impossible to roll out like this\nso wrap it up in plastic wrap and let it chill completely in the fridge. If you're in a hurry, wrap them in two or\nmore divisions so they can chill through quickly in the coldest part of your fridge for a couple\nhours. But if you have the time, just one ball is\ngood and leave it in the fridge overnight. Or, you leave this in there up to three days\nin advance of your baking day. When the dough is good and chilled, it'll\nstill be pliable. No need to let it rest; get to work right\naway. Take out anything extra that's in your oven\nnow, move a rack to the middle position and preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F or 175\u00b0C. Dust your clean work surface generously with\nflour. Before plopping on your dough. I'm working with just half the dough because\nI don't have that much space here and it's just easier this way. The rest can go back in the fridge. Dust the top of the dough with flour as well\nand your rolling pin. Or in my case, my trusty beer bottle rolling\npin that's been with me since the beginning of this channel. While I'm here feeling nostagic, I want to\ngive a special thank you to everyone who's been with me since that time. I see you in the comments sometimes and it's\njust so nice to know we've been on this journey all these years together. Add flour if you need to; we'll dust off any\nexcess later. And get that dough down to about a quarter\ninch thick as even as you can get it. I think mine's just a little thinner than\nthat today but, like I said, this recipe is flexible. Now you can select your gingerbread cookie\ncutters. I've got this generic one and these two with\nbites taken off the head already. I love them. So adorable. Anyways, dust them with flour and get to cutting. Lay out the cookie shapes on to parchment\nlined baking sheets. You can bake the first sheet now if your oven's\npreheated already. 8 minutes for soft cookies that are nice and\nchewy around the edges. Or 10 minutes for crunchier cookies. Depending on your oven, of course. Every one's a little different. Just like people. Ball up the extra dough and I'll use the same\npiece of plastic to wrap it up. This can chill in the frige while we work\non the second half. These were done just as the oven timer went\noff. Perfect! Let these sit on the baking sheet for a couple\nminutes just to firm up slightly before gently transferring them to a cooling rack. Keep going until all your dough is used up. You'll want to let these cool completely before\ndecorating them. We'll do a simple icing today starting with\na quarter teaspoon vanilla extract and a tablespoon of soy milk or your choice of plant-based\nmilk. A tablespoon of corn syrup helps make the\nicing really smooth and pipeable. Stir all together. Then you can add one and a half\ncups of icing sugar. Stir until you cannot stir anymore. We're going to need a bit more liquid so I'm\ngoing in with a teaspoon of soy milk. It's easy to add too much so go easy. Just one more teaspoon of soymilk and we have\na perfect decorator's icing. Transfer the icing to a piping bag with a\nthin tip or if you can't find your tips just reinforce the corner with packing tape like\nI did. Snip off the end and away you go. Make sure the top of the bag is secure and\napply even pressure for a steady flow. Don't be discouraged if your first gingerbread\npeople look a little like a toddler made it. I find it helps to sketch out what you want\nto do on paper. Then find it way too complicated and give\nup opting for a simpler design. You'll have plenty of icing leftover so while\nyou're endlessly decorating you can think of what other cookies you want to make and\ndecorate this season. Let me know what your ideas are. Maybe I need some ideas myself! You might wonder, why the heck I made the\nrecipe for the icing so generous and isn't that just a waste of ingredients? To which I say, fair enough but it is just\neasier to handle this amount than trying to make smaller amounts. Before you know it, you'll have an army of\ngingerbread people ready to take Santa's territory to the South Pole. Let them sit out for an hour so the icing\ncan completely harden. Though since it's super dry in Alberta and\nit might take longer where you are. And eat the uglier ones first before packing\nthe rest away for your friends, family, or in my case, your boyfriend's co-workers because\nI need most of the batch out of my kitchen immediately or I'll eat them all and I don't\nwant to do that because I need to make room for the cinnamon rolls I'm about to bake up\nnext. And that's it. These cookies, like most homemade cookies,\nare best eaten in a couple days but they will store up to two weeks pretty well. Keep in mind, they lose some of their crispness\nafter you seal them in a bag for a while. After a couple of weeks, I'd say edible but you know, you\ncould probably tell they are a couple weeks old. You would never let that happen on your watch\nwould you? Thanks so much for watching my friends. I hope you liked this video.

Bye for now!", "JnaOyKcICBU": "cinnamon cream molasses cookies [Music] hello everyone starting off with the dry ingredients two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour one teaspoon of ground ginger 1/2 a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of baking soda give that a stir and then set that aside in another bowl place six tablespoons of white sugar and six tablespoons of shortening vegetable shortening belen those things together and then blend in one egg once that's combined they'll add in 1/2 cup of molasses that's been warmed and the reason you warm it just so that it blends up easier and then you're gonna gradually add the dry mixture a little bit out of time maybe two or three additions until you get kind of a soft crumbly dough and you're gonna bring it together with your hands until it forms a dough ball cut that dough ball in half then roll out that half to about a quarter of an inch thickness now I do mine between sheets of parchment paper just because it's less messy you can do it right on your countertop just sprinkle it with some flour and flour up your rolling pin then you're gonna cut out two inch rounds so the bottom of the cookie is gonna be just a plain round shape and the top of the cookie is gonna have a hole cut out in it just kind of as a decoration you don't have to put the holes in them if you don't want to I just think they look really nice now the secret to this dough is to chill it before you try to remove your shapes so I put it on a cookie sheet with the parchment paper right into the fridge or the freezer for 15-20 minutes and then the dough will firm up a bit and it'll be so much easier to get those pieces off of the parchment and onto the cookie sheet this way they'll stay nice and round they won't tear and they will distort the shape first batch I did I made some with some small ones but when these cookies bake they expand a little so the hole got really small so the next batch I used a larger hole cutter for the middle kind of cut flower shape and then you're gonna bake these at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes so they're just lightly Brown now for the filling the filling I ended up doubling because the original recipe I found did not make enough basically you have two tablespoons of butter two cups of powdered two teaspoons of ground cinnamon and enough warm water so that you when you blend it you get spreadable consistency so you just stir all those things together I put mine in a piping bag just I thought it would be easier you're gonna spread about a teaspoon teaspoon and a half the amount is up to you of course on to one half of the cookie and then add the cookie with the hole on the top right over there just press down slightly and you have a completed cookie now if you don't want to use a piping bag you can just spread it on with a spatula or a butter knife that works as well now this buttercream will crust up like regular buttercream does so you'll be able to stack these in a container at room temperature now my husband loves any cookie that has cinnamon and molasses in the me loves that combination so he I made these for him in the month of April but you certainly can use this as a Christmas cookie if you'd like the cookie is quite crisp it's call most like I have a ginger snap kind of a texture to it I make a lot of cookies I haven't want to play this in fact I think there's about 130 different kind of cookies on this playlist you will find a cookie that you will love go check it out thanks for watching", "P6L4JliV3eQ": "[Music] [Music] and what are you eating Penelope um cookie didn't your molasses cooked even though Christmas is over Penelope and I want to share with you one of our favorite holiday Christmas cookies this is the ginger molasses cookie and today we're gonna be making these grain free gluten free delicious cookies with you guys okay so the first thing we need to do is preheat our oven to 375 did you hear that 375 and we're going to measure out one and a half cups of almond flour [Music] I'm gonna fill this up halfway to make a half of it next we're going to need 1/3 cup of coconut flour okay there's our third cup coconut flour one teaspoon of baking soda we're gonna need a pinch of salt this recipe is gonna go really fast as it's quick and easy three tablespoons of coconut oil we're gonna need to mark this I usually pull out a little bit more than three tablespoons of coconut oils so that way I can use some for the chocolate drizzle at the end we want to add two and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon there was one I'm gonna need you to mix now our recipe calls for one teaspoon of ground ginger I don't have dried ginger at the moment I have fresh ginger I'm just gonna zest my ginger over here over the top of it [Music] I took off most of the skin on it smell that okay now we need our three tablespoons of melted coconut oil to sweeten these cookies we're gonna sweeten it with maple syrup 1/3 of a cup next we're going to need 2 tablespoons of molasses and lastly 1 egg [Music] the consistency should look just like this so next thing you want to do is just get these cookies in the oven for about 12 to 15 minutes taking our cookies out of the oven while they are cooling we can make the chocolate drizzle we have a pan here of our melted coconut oil from we melted it for the ingredients I would say this is about half a tablespoon here so next we're going to take some chocolate chips maybe two handfuls on low we're gonna keep this on low and then we're just going to melt the chocolate chips now that we've melted our chocolate and our coconut oil together in a pan we're going to wait until it cools and then we get to drizzle it on to these cookies have a little ziploc bag and put it in a cup or a mug to hold it upright just take a corner and snip off a very very tiny corner yeah cookie and that's our ginger molasses cookies I'm so happy to share this recipe with you I'm gonna receive this recipe down below in the show notes section and I thank you guys for watching it hope you have a wonderful day [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Py6QnoqpFj0": "[Music] the [Music] [Applause] [Music]

good girl i don't know if you can hear it but they're doing construction in the basement so there's a lot of sounds happening in this house i'm currently making candles i just poured a small batch of coffee shop i'm also gonna do some pine tree and maybe one other scent i'm running out of wick so i need to reorder those i've decided i'm gonna start posting more videos on the melo youtube channel it's gonna be like behind the scenes of the business sorry about all the noise i only have one video up on that channel and i posted it in 2018 when i launched melo and the plan was to film more on that channel but then i just never got around to it and honestly i didn't know if anyone would actually want to watch but i have been getting some requests from you guys to post more like behind the scenes business stuff and i also realized that a lot of you guys also have your own small businesses or you want to start a small business so i think that a lot of you are interested in seeing that side of things so definitely go subscribe to that channel if you want to see more of that i thought i would do a weekly vlog it is currently 2 p.m on monday today kind of flew by i feel like mondays go by really fast because i just have a lot of work to get done in the mornings i don't really have anything planned for this week besides work we'll see what i end up filming but tomorrow i'm actually getting my extensions out these have probably been my favorite extensions i love that they're basically my natural hair color they blend so well and i haven't really styled my hair i have maybe like added a few curls in like a handful of times but the way that this hair dries it just has like this natural wave to it and i think it looks really good and it blends with my hair pretty well so i don't really ever style my hair which is really nice i'm getting them taken out just because i've had them in for about two months and i definitely want to get them back in but i also want to give my hair a little bit of a break so i'm going to see how long i can go without them but i know i'm just going to want to get them put back in but i'll probably leave it for like a week or two give my hair some like really good scalp massages but literally that's the only thing i have planned this week so we'll see what we get up to [Music] [Music] the sun has really been out these past couple days good morning you guys it's really bright i'm heading to my hair appointment now we're gonna take out my extensions see what my real hair is looking like i'm interested to see if it's looking any better or worse because it's just been hiding behind these nice extensions for the past two months we'll see if it's gotten any longer is it gonna be thinner because this is my first time having these like beaded extensions so i don't know like is it gonna take out some of my real hair [Music] [Applause] the extensions are out so i'll be wearing my hair back like this until they're back in i don't know if any of you guys are like this but i just cannot wear my natural hair down i just i hate it so much and i'm trying to not think of my hair like that i'm trying to appreciate my natural hair and accept it if you have naturally long thick hair i don't want to say i'm jealous of you but i am i just hope you appreciate it i keep going like this and like clumps of hair coming out and i know it's because the extensions can totally pull out some of your hair but i think the main thing is that the natural hair that shedding gets trapped in the beads so all of your hair that would have fallen out naturally in the two months is like trapped and so it all comes out in clumps when you get your extensions removed but here is my hair my battery's about to die so i'm just gonna try to quickly show you it is 11am now i need to go home and eat breakfast i have not been eating well lately and it's not on purpose like i just get so busy with work that i don't eat i'm trying to eat every few hours but i've been doing a terrible job and i literally don't eat until like noon so like unintentional intermittent fasting but yeah i need to get better at that so i'm gonna go home and eat some food i'm trying to find my hair scissors because i need to give my hair a little bit of a trim i have no idea where i put them so i'm gonna have to do that later my scalp is feeling super flaky so i'm gonna give it a good scrub um i actually think i have like a scalp scrub i'm gonna look for that too but i'm gonna use the neutrogena tea gel dandruff shampoo i'm almost done so i have to keep it upside down and i'm also trying out a new hair mask i just finished this one from shea moisture and it was pretty good but i got a new one this one actually had way better reviews let me know if any of you guys have tried it and then i'm also going to try this product from kerastase it's a rinse out pre shampoo revitalizing exfoliating scalp and hair i'm just letting my hair air dry it's like 50 dry i might switch up a couple things this month and see if i notice a difference i always like trying new things but when i have extensions in i feel like i can't really actually give products or like whatever thing i'm switching up a chance so yeah i'm really going to focus on that this month see if we get anywhere but i just got a packaging it's actually part of colby's christmas present and he's not home right now so i'm going to unpack it check it out and then maybe wrap it i'm also currently working on a really fun project i've actually been working on it for a while and i don't think i'm allowed to talk about it yet but it's just been slow moving and we're finally getting somewhere now i just got sent some like a draft of what it is so i need to look over it uh send feedback and i'm just really excited to finally get this going so i'm gonna work on that for the next little bit [Music] so [Music] [Music] i want to film a house tour while the christmas decorations are still up but before i can do that i need to clean the house so i'm going to start tackling it room by room the dogs are currently sunbathing in here they're so hot in the sun this is the current state of the room honestly it's mostly clothes so once these are put away it won't look that [Music] bad [Music] so we're taking a little break i had to pack up some more stuff for mellow and then i got a package dropped off at the door and i have no idea who this is from it says the gifting team so we will see who is oh i'm so confused okay i picked a bunch of stuff out from revolve that i'm gonna shoot on my instagram i was like is this a blanket i got this really like soft coat jacket i have too many jackets now but yeah i need to take pictures of these on instagram so i'm not going to show you on here but if you want to see what i picked out follow my instagram you guys almost fell into coffee good morning i am currently in the whole foods parking lot i'm about to do a grocery shop this is like my big outing for the week pretty much the only time i leave the house is to go to the post office or to get groceries which reminds me i was supposed to bring a package to ship i totally forgot to do that we ran out of vegetables a bunch of different spices and i really want to make gingerbread molasses cookies is that what they're called ginger molasses cookies why do i feel like there's a different name anyways so this isn't really like my standard grocery shop of the things that i normally get [Music] i might make a second coffee i'm going to make my cookies now and then i need to make some candles as well i picked up the necessary ingredients we have some blackstrap molasses some white sugar i'm going to be using coconut sugar instead of brown sugar and i hope that it works the same because i know brown sugar is like a very key ingredient in these cookies i also got some ground cloves and then i think we have everything else i'm just using a recipe i found on pinterest so if i remember i'll link it down below in case you want to use it okay i think i'm gonna brew some more coffee to drink while i make cookies maybe i'll put some tunes on [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] um [Music] i'm just picking up some starbucks it is currently 11 i still haven't eaten anything today so i'm getting a turkey bacon breakfast sandwich i don't normally get food from starbucks i love their drinks but i don't love the food but i need to eat something so i'm just grabbing that i just dropped off candles at honey's so if you guys are in langley go check it out and now i'm gonna try to find somewhere to take an instagram photo i just haven't hang on i have to pay for a second 11 35 today on visa thank you i just pulled over i'm gonna eat this but i want to take an instagram photo i have had no content to post lately because normally i get photos when i travel with friends or i go to events or i'm just like with friends and right now we can't really see our friends and i'm just not going anywhere so i just have nothing to take pictures of and i have no one to take photos for me hot oh my god can you oh can you see the steam oh no egg fell down ah fell down under my chair anyways i feel like i need to start taking my own photos so that i have content to post so i have my bluetooth clicker with me and i want to find a spot and just like take an outfit picture today but i need to find somewhere to do that and i don't really know where to go preferably somewhere where no one is it was a little hectic in there so i didn't bring you guys in but we got the goods so here's everything i picked up from costco it's all pretty standard stuff we normally get like yogurt veggies some canned foods meat eggs egg whites avocado oil frozen berries this isn't the bread that i normally get but they didn't have the one that i like so this is not gluten-free i normally get gluten-free quinoa we got rice macadamia milk all the goods the only new thing i'm trying out these jojo's bars it's just dark chocolate with pistachios almonds and cranberries and they sounded really good so i didn't end up getting my photo i probably drove around for about an hour trying to find a spot to shoot but everywhere i went was super busy even like random parking lots and parks it was so crowded to the point that it felt like it was like a holiday weekend well i guess it is a friday but still friday's not a weekend and it was like 1pm but anyways um so didn't get my photo but i still feel like today was pretty productive also i didn't end up showing you guys the cookies that i made yesterday they're so good i highly recommend the recipe that i used i only made one sheet yesterday i'm just about to put these ones in the oven and then i still have more cookie dough that i just leave in the fridge so i probably have maybe like another sheet or two of cookies that i can make but i like to do them in batches and then they're fresh and voila i just finished putting all the groceries away i put them away in an organized fashion and it is very time consuming um but also very satisfying once it's done and now i am making some more candles i got a call today and this has a big backstory but um let's just spoil it now so earlier this year this must have been like eight months ago now it was near the beginning of the year one of my cousins went in for genetic testing and they came back with a gene that puts you at high risk for developing breast cancer or ovarian cancer or maybe it's both and it is a hereditary gene um my grandma also had breast cancer so it's something that i should be tested for so i called the bc cancer society this was at the beginning of the year that i called them and they said that if my mom got tested and she came back negative that i wouldn't have to be tested but i didn't know if my mom was gonna go in so i asked them to book me in and they said i'd get a call back in several months and now it's been like eight months and they just called me today except i missed the call but i'm assuming that i'm able to get booked in now so yeah i'll keep you posted oh my gosh this face mask when it dries it pulls my eyebrows up here it is now saturday just having my coffee i'm editing this vlog i am going to end it here i think if i stick to vlogging monday to friday and doing like a weekday vlog versus monday to sunday it'll be more maintainable because when i do monday to sunday i'm editing monday morning and it takes me like the entire morning to get it posted and then i try to start another one it is doable but it just gets overwhelming after a while so i think if i want to be able to like stick to vlogs i need to do just like weekdays give this video a thumbs up if you guys want more weekly vlogs i think i'm gonna stick to just like a mixture of weekly vlogs and other videos which is like kind of what i've been doing i have a haul video coming soon i'm gonna be posting a video on mellow pretty soon um probably gonna start another vlog and then i had a couple other video ideas i can't remember what it was but yeah subscribe if you haven't already links to all my social medias are down below hope you guys all have a great day and i'll see you in my next video", "r35vr_3nvvU": "greetings youtube friends it's joyce from morris patch of heaven homestead and today we are in the kitchen it is fall and i am going to make molasses cookies i've done this before i did a video on it before but i'm going to do it again there are so many of you that have never even had a molasses cookies a cookie let alone make one it is so simple so delicious you have to give it a try it is one of our family favorites um i have been making these for many many years our kiddos the girls especially when they were younger people used to request that they make them and they would buy them from them so my girls were young entrepreneurs they all they all have been that way boys as well got into wanting to make cookies because they could sell them for a lot of money because people wanted to pay they paid them quite a bit for molasses cookies because it's a cookie you can't really find anywhere you can find you know during the holidays of snickerdoodles and you know different christmas cookies but molasses cookies are kind of hard to find i know the amish usually have them but i don't think they make it with the black strap molasses like we do the dark dark molasses because the cookies are so dark the ones that you buy in the store if you bought them at the amish would be a lighter brown they just don't taste as spicy as these so um anyway so they would make those go around the square and people would buy them and i forget what they charge but they were making quite a bit i think it may have been five dollars a dozen even back then so um anyway it is a family favorite that we have been doing for many years and so um i had shared that i would do this for you again and so i thought what better day than to start now or in the kitchen anyway i'm going to get started and show you how we make these yummy chewy gooey molasses cookies anyway we're going to start two cups of flour it's so simple guys i know a lot of times people think oh that sounds like a lot of work it takes a few ingredients i have to say um but not anything out of the ordinary i mean not any more than most cookies would have you're just adding more spice okay oh you know what i am doing this my kitchenaid broke quite a while ago and they are very expensive so i am making it in my kitchenaid i know that sounds awfully funny but it does work it does the mixing for me and i realized i was gonna do it that way i was gonna hand mix it but i like the way it turns out okay so two cups of flour and one teaspoon of baking soda [Music] very very simple and so worth it guys once you make these and people get wind of it they're going to want you to make them for them all the time we get quite a few requests for them okay a teaspoon of cinnamon it sounds like there's a lot in here but there really is not you know what you could probably do an allspice if you wanted to but you can do it any way you want okay ginger i will have the recipe in the description box for you below so that you can give it a try and when you do please let me know what you think and if you have never tried a molasses cookie you are in for a treat i know people are scared of molasses because they're thinking oh no it's healthy it probably won't taste good this is simply over the top and i think once you get the taste of molasses you can start putting it in tea and your oatmeal and just experiment with it because it is so high in potassium it's so good for you okay now instead of going off on a tangent i will finish here cloves nutmeg make sure that i'm putting in the right amounts here i don't want to put too much because it might be too spicy but that would not be a bad thing salt i always that always was one of those things years ago when i was really starting to bake i always thought why do you put salt in a cookie just kind of offset the sweetness i guess okay let's see here and where am i at one teaspoon okay all righty okay i am using avocado oil you can use butter you can use olive oil but try to use the healthy oils because in the end this is going to be a really healthy cookie believe it or not even though it tastes so good and it's rolled in sugar it does have sugar in it but for the most part there's some healthy ingredients in there okay so 3 4 of a cup of olive oil i know you think that sounds like a lot avocado oil did i say olive oil either one but this is a pretty big batch and that does help with the moistness which you want you definitely want that because that's what makes it so moist okay one large egg our girls are laying overtime check out these eggs guys oh my goodness yummy we're not complaining at all okay one egg a fourth cup of molasses and this is what i do we bought this by the gallon because it was only eight dollars look at this oh my word so yummy and see i put the oil in first because now when i do the molasses this is a trick you can do with honey as well if you're baking with it put it in first and even though it says a fourth of a cup i do a lot more and look at that it'll come right off of your measuring spoon look at that clean yeah i like a lot of molasses i'm going to put just a little bit more just because i can't and i know you're probably going how's that going to work with the measurements it's fine it'll work just because i love molasses and why not add a little bit more if you can kind of like with honey just add a little bit more oh we're dripping oh well it's all good okay let me see here did we get everything i believe we need brown sugar that would help 3 4 cup of brown sugar and i'm all about using what you can as far as your measuring spoons are concerned because then you don't have as many dirty dishes and we have plenty of those around here why make more for yourself okay pack that brown sugar down three-fourths of a cup well the oven's telling me it's ready 350 for 10 or 11 minutes you want these soft so you don't want to leave them in too long because then they'll be crunchy and if you like crunchy cookies that's good but this is a chewy gooey molasses cookie okay so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to go ahead and mix this and i'll bring you back and show you what it looks like okay it's all mixed up as you can see look at that oh my word it smells heavenly smells so good this is what this is what falls all about okay so what we're gonna do now is we are going to take about so much and you roll it in a ball you like a good size and then i have a fourth cup of regular sugar or or organic cane crystals i should say and you put that in a bowl and then basically all you do is just take as big as you would want the cookie to be or a small this one's a little bit smaller roll it into a ball and roll it through sugar and voila and so i will continue this on my cookie sheet and i'll show you what it looks like when it's done and when it goes into the oven no sense in watching me roll every one of them and i'll bring you back [Music] okay guys the first batch came out of the oven it smells so good in here i'm trying to be good how can you be good when you have something so delicious look at these they are simply divine and jedi and avonlea were already trying to get them off of the cookie sheet you're supposed to let them sit on the cookie sheet for about five minutes after they come out of the oven and then you are good to either put them on a cooling rack these have sat a little bit longer and then you can put plate them up and look at that how pretty i have a little fall plate that i got at a thrift store this weekend my daughter and i had some time between photo shoots and we decided to stop at this little thrift store in town and it has acorns and it's so festive and it's got the little um maple leaves on there and the little fall leaves i thought oh my had to have that i think it was a dollar it was so cute so it's perfect for my molasses cookies oops this one's a little stuck on there the little piece of parchment paper okay that's not supposed to happen it was on the end there we go got it out saved it anyway i always put parchment paper down just because it kind of saves your baking sheet from getting really really dirty and everything seems to come off really easily except for that one piece that was stuck on an edge so here we go like i said i know i've already done a video on molasses cookies but i just wanted to show you how simple it is to make these and how delicious they are and how passionate i am about them because it is definitely one of our favorites so since i made those i'm going to break one in half and show you the inside and how delicious it is and of course i have to take a bite [Music] a definite happy dance so so good i hope that you will give these a try if you have never done that because you will love them they are definitely worth trying and not any harder than any other cookie but anyway guys i'm going to end for now i just wanted to share this with you real quick and hope that you will give this a try this fall because it smells like fall in here all of those spices together are just amazing but anyway guys i hope that you are all doing well we are sending blessings from our home to you to yours and um if you have not subscribed we ask that you do so that will help our channel to

Cristo comm and I'm gonna be making molasses cookies these are not just your average cookies these are not only vegan but also gluten-free they're kind of a copycat recipe of the oldest most well-loved cookie recipe from my family we always call them grandma Grace's molasses cookies and they've been passed down through every generation every year during the holidays we would do what we call a big family bake-off where all the women in the family aunts grandmothers and now grandchildren and we all get together in bake cookies for Christmas and this was the most popular recipe always has been now because of the different dietary needs in my own family we've learned to adapt these cookies only we've discovered a recipe that makes them just as delicious as the original the trick is gluten-free flour and then we use a little sweet potato puree and aquafaba which is canned chickpea liquid and a total GameChanger for people who have egg allergies so the most critical components for flavor here are the molasses and their molasses cookies so I like to use a really strong molasses briar as my preference I like to use the briar molasses not only for its rich flavor which is so distinctive for these particular cookies but also for that really dark color and then all of the spices the cinnamon the ginger the cloves the nutmeg those are really defining flavors and I like to use McCormick spices for that what I love about McCormick spices is that I know wherever I am if I'm baking at somebody else's house I can always rely on them McCormick has like a really high standard and they're my go-to [Music] and that's really it it just comes together in a really soft dough and I like to scoop it out with an ice cream scooper or just use a large spoon and you'll pop it into a bowl of sugar and use that sugar to sort of get it into a ball shape and roll it around and coat it you pop it on a pan and bake it at 350 for 8 to 10 minutes and you have a perfect chewy cookie it's so delicious [Music] so this is my favorite recipe to cook with the girls over the holidays everybody in my family loves these cookies I hope your family loves them just as much for the full recipe head on over to my blog Heather Cristo calm [Music]", "u_FnvHW2ptQ": "- Hey, guys, today I'm\ngoing to share with you a really easy idea for\nsummer entertaining. They're my ginger molasses\nice cream sandwiches. Now, I am a huge fan of\nginger molasses cookies. They're one of my favorite flavors. I don't like to wait till the\nChristmastime to eat them. I think they're great all year 'round, especially when you serve them as ice cream sandwiches in the summertime. Let me show you how to put it together. (gentle instrumental music) The first thing we're going\nto do is prepare our cookies. So, in the bowl of an electric mixer, you're going to add in\n3/4 cup of softened butter and one cup of sugar. You want to beat that on high until it's nice and fluffy. And then, to that you're going to add a 1/3 of a cup of molasses. And make sure you beat that up until it's nice and combined, and then you can scrape down the bowl. And then, you're also going to add one egg and a teaspoon of vanilla\nand you can beat that up. Then, in a separate bowl, you're going to combine your dry ingredients. We're just going to use two\ncups of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda, a teaspoon of salt, 1 1/2\nteaspoons of ground cinnamon, 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground ginger and a half a teaspoon of ground cloves. And you can mix that all up. Then, you're slowly going\nto add these dry ingredients to your butter mixture just in thirds beating in-between each addition and scraping down the bowl just until everything is combined. And then, at that stage,\nthis is something I love to do to molasses cookies,\nis add a little bit of candied ginger. Now, you can sometimes find candied ginger in the spice aisle of your supermarket. If you can't find it in your supermarket, you can also buy it online and I'll leave you a\nlink in the description. And we're going to add\ntwo tablespoons of that to our dough, and then you beat that up. Then, it is important to\nrefrigerate this dough for at least an hour\njust to let it set up. And if you can, overnight is even better, so you could even do this\nwhole thing two days before. Then, you're going to scoop out your dough with a ice cream scoop. These are going to make three-inch cookies which I think is a really\nnice, generous size for an ice cream sandwich,\nbut you certainly could make them smaller. And then, you're going\nto roll each dough ball in some sugar and place\nit on a cookie sheet that's been lined with parchment paper. And then, you're going\nto bake your cookies at 350 degree Fahrenheit\nfor just 15 minutes. And you're see, they will spread out and start to crack a bit on the top and that's when you know they're done. And then, when it's time to\nassemble your sandwiches, you can go ahead and just scoop out a really great portion\nof vanilla ice cream. I do like to use really good\nquality vanilla ice cream just because there's not\na lot to these cookies that you want to make\nsure you have something really decadent and creamy. And then, place it on\na smaller cookie sheet. So, once you assemble\nall of the sandwiches, you can then cover your\ntray with some aluminum foil and pop the whole thing in the freezer. And if you let that freeze anywhere from an hour to overnight,\nyou will be good to go. You can pile them on a cake stand and let everybody serve themselves. And what's really nice, it\nmakes it a little bit easier to eat, is you can also cut these in half if you have children, or you\ncan even cut them in quarters. So, there you have it, ginger\nmolasses ice cream sandwiches, a treat that's really worthy\nof summer entertaining. It's one of my favorite things to serve when I have a multi-generational crowd of kids and grownups because\nthey please everybody. I hope you guys give this one a try and let me know what you think.

Until then, bye.", "m0TEJV_UFm8": "hi I'm Susan Evans from Susan Evans org and today we are going to make some treats for Civil War soldiers yes if you are studying the Civil War you will want to bring to life that time period with something delicious to eat and molasses cookies are one of the treats that Civil War soldiers used to eat they also used to eat canned peaches and canned condensed milk those things were really really premium in during the time of the Civil War now we are using all American history vol 2 by Brian Diaz press in order to learn all about the Civil War and this is one of the hands-on activities that they recommend in their curriculum and so let us now bake some old fashioned molasses cookies we are making some old-fashioned molasses cookies that Confederate soldiers and Union soldiers would have enjoyed during the time of the Civil War so these are some treats for Civil War soldiers now I looked up on the internet the different recipes during that time some of them have ingredients that are hard to come by so I have put together a certain list of ingredients that are available to you that will help you to be able to taste what it was like to have those molasses cookies okay one third of a cup of brown sugar is the first thing that you will need then you will need 1/3 of a cup of shortening ok and then you will need 1 egg 2/3 of a cup of molasses make sure that you have not put a shell a shell into there okay um 2/3 cup of molasses so molasses and of course it slow as molasses to pour it's got kind of the same consistency as honey so here's 1/3 and then we have 2/3 okay 2/3 grab a large spoon and stir those first four ingredients together so all we have so far is brown sugar shortening egg and molasses and you cream that together first okay next we will put in 2 and 3/4 cups of flour so that's 1/2 and then 3/4 you have 1/4 2/4 3/4 okay and then we will have 2 tablespoons of cinnamon tablespoons oh that's gonna be bad ok hmm wow that's a lot of cinnamon ladies and gentlemen maybe you know what I'm gonna do teaspoons because there's no way that's that much okay so I'm going to do two teaspoons of cinnamon not 2 tablespoons okay so that is two teaspoons of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ginger okay okay 1 teaspoon of soda and that's baking soda obviously you didn't have I don't think you had carbonated drinks in the 1860 I think coca-cola I think that was the turn of the century okay let's see 1 teaspoon of salt sneeze 1 teaspoon of salt okay so now we stir all of these ingredients together okay go ahead and stir it all together this is how it looks when it's mixed and you will want to make it into a ball okay and what you want to do is you want to cover it okay and then cover it with cellophane and put it into the refrigerator for 1 hour it's been an hour of chilled dough you set that down and you roll it out to 1/4 of an inch thick okay so 1/4 of an inch thick so go ahead and roll out your cookie dough okay then get something circular you can either get a lid or a glass or something like that something that you make desserts in and then go ahead and cut out your cookies so it's kind of like sugar cookies in the way that you make them heat up the oven to 375 degrees and bake for about 10 minutes or so and this is what you what they look like before they are baked all right it's been 10 minutes and here are the molasses cookies look at how delicious these old-fashioned molasses cookies look and they taste really good too I'm Susan Evans from Susan Evans org thanks for watching", "lEoN2rEHvqg": "- Today we're making gingerbread people! There are men, ladies, children, and you can even have\nanimals if you want, too. Super easy, really delightful, and, (upbeat music) Delicious.\n(laughs) Let's get started! Starting off with three\ncups of all-purpose flour. Three cups is 360 grams,\nin case you're wondering, so just a little bit more. (laughs) Perfect, okay. Now we're going to add our spices in, get this really gingery. So, I have a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and I have two teaspoons of ground ginger. But, if you're worried about\nthe bite, cut it in half. Use less. You can't use none then, cause then you can't call\nthem gingerbread cookies. One quarter teaspoon of\nsalt and baking soda. Let's talk about this for a second. Because, I'm gonna warn\nyou, your gingerbread men are gonna be a little bit Rubenesque. They're gonna puff up. So if you want that\nnice, pillowy consistency for gingerbread that's\nfresh out of the oven, a little bit of leavening agent helps. But, if you want them to be, like, more, almost sugar cookies,\nyou're gonna skip this. Like, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, cut down the molasses, and they'll be a bit more svelte. One teaspoon of baking soda, in you go. Sift this together, and then\nwe're gonna give it a whisk. And then we're gonna set it aside. (upbeat music) This is why you wanna sift, by the way, because you'll end up\nwith these giant granules, or like, little boulders\nof ginger otherwise. And that's gonna be a\nspicy surprise (laughs). Although it might teach your kid a lesson. Whisk-a, whisk-a, whisk-a. And set aside. All right, now we're creaming 3/4 of a cup of unsalted butter at room temperature. Add that in there, with a\npaddle attachment, mind you. Don't cream it with your hands. Get this nice and movin'. (blender stirring) Now we're adding in 3/4 of a cup of firmly packed brown sugar. I'm using light brown sugar,\nyou can use dark brown sugar if you'd like. Toss it in there, okay. (blender stirring) You want this to get nice\nand light and fluffy, so it will take a second. (blender stirring) And, you're gonna wanna\nscrape the bowl down (laughs). (blender stirring) All right, so, looks pretty fluffy to me. I'm gonna add in one\nteaspoon of vanilla extract. This is optional though,\nI'm gonna be real. The vanilla kind of gets\nlost among the other flavors, there's a lot going on in these cookies. So add that in, and then,\nthe half cup of molasses. So gross on it's own (laughs) but in recipes, much better. (blender stirring) Scrape the bowl down again, there's a lot of layers happening. (upbeat music) Add one egg in. (blender stirring) All right, now everything's incorporated. It's time to add our\ndry ingredients in here. Just gradually pour it in. Gradually, not all at the same time. Use your clean hands. Gonna scrape that bowl\ndown again (laughs). This video should be called\n\"Scraping the Bowl Down.\" (blender stirring) All right, so now we're\ngonna take this monster bit of gingerbread dough, plop it\ninto a sealable plastic bag, just for ease of use. Set that aside. You can either press\nit out with your hands, or roll it out. And we're gonna put this\ninto the fridge overnight. Yes, overnight, or for\nat least four hours. Trust me, it's one of those recipes where it kind of has to happen. Into the fridge you go. I have a batch of dough\nthat chilled overnight, and now we're gonna take it out. This stuff is a sticky, gooey, wet mess, I'm just warning you. It is not like my no-spread sugar cookies, which you can click up here for. If you want a shape to\nbe nice and perfect, go for that recipe. This is a delicious spiced concoction, it fluffs up a bit, it spreads out, but it's gingerbread. It's not really a way around it. Okay, gonna cut this open. Let's flour our surface a bit. (upbeat music) It smells really good. So gingery. Sprinkle some more flour on top, I'm telling you, it's gonna\nget messy ahead of time. (pats dough) (dough slaps table) Just wanna make sure\nit's nice and floured. Now we're gonna roll this out. Make sure you move it around\nas you roll it out, too. Don't think everything's\ngonna be okay if you don't. 'Cause it's not. Little dusting, it's like\ngingerbread pizza dough. I have a selection of gingerbread men. This guy is my favorite even\nthough he's pretty big, so. Just start off by cutting it up. And then you can fill in\nthe spaces with the other, smaller gingerbread people (laughs). And just plop these directly\nonto your baking sheet. The excess dough can get rerolled. You don't have to chill this overnight, but it helps (laughs). Be very ginger with these\ngingerbread men (laughs). (sighs) I love being a dad, so\nI can say all of this stuff. And the dough is starting to warm up, so work quickly peeps. Now I have a lot of scraps here, so you have a couple options. You can get smaller cookie cutter shapes and cut out some, you know, stars, little Christmas stockings,\nwhatever you like. Also, I find from personal experience that you end up, like, kind of trying to pick these up too quickly\nand they start breaking. You really have to let\nthem sit for a while to, kind of, cure before. Otherwise, you'll just,\nlike, snap the head off, you'll be sad. Or roll it up, make the\nwhole batch right now. I guarantee you will\ndefinitely be snacking. These guys are gonna\ngo into the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. A little puffing, a little spreading. These guys are too close,\nI'm gonna move them around before they go into the oven,\nand they'll be totally set. Okay, so I was about to roll\nout the rest of this dough that I kind of clumped\ntogether, my extras. But, look at this, it\nis so liquidy already. You really have to work quickly. This has to be chilled again. Unless you don't care about the shapes, you wanna make little gingerbread goops, which is totally fine,\nthey'll still be delicious. But for me, cover it\nback up, into the fridge, and let it chill, cut shapes later. I wanna have my gingerbread\npeople holding onto something, or at least two of them. So I'm gonna take sheet of\ntin foil, crumple it up, nice and tight (laughs). And then, just push it together, have it be roughly the same\nsize as my peppermint candy. So I will bake the\ngingerbread person (laughs), gingerbread man, holding\non to this ball of tin foil like this, and then once it\ncomes right out of the oven, I'm gonna do an Indiana Jones style swap, and it'll harden with the\narms holding the candy. Might it break? Yes, it might, so be\ncareful, and make extra. While those gingerbread\nmen are in the oven, I'm gonna make a very small\nbatch of royal icing up. I usually don't use royal icing, I am not a cookie artist (laughs). I'm adding a cup and a\nhalf of confectioners sugar into a bowl. This should probably\nbe a larger bowl, but. (metal cups clang together) There you go. Couple dashes of cream of tartar. Just whisk that up a bit. Oh, I should definitely\nuse an electric mixer. Let's see how this is gonna go. One egg white. That's a fresh egg. You can tell, because it's\nreally holding it together. The more watery the egg\nwhite, the older it is. Watery egg whites are good for\nmaking macaroon, by the way. Let's start mixing it up. It's kind of like making\na glaze, basically, but just with an egg white. It's gonna be kind of annoying, 'cause it'll be like,\nclump, clump clump clump, and it'll magically turn into a glaze. And yes, there will be mess involved. You can also add more egg white,\nor more confectioners sugar to change the consistency. You know, for those crazy sugar cookies, you have like the outline consistency and the flooding consistency. The flooding consistency\nis always more watery. So, I'm not doing any flooding on these, just some outline piping for contrast. There we go, look at that. Breakin' my arm over here. This would be so much\neasier in an electric mixer but I didn't wanna do\nit, I don't know why. Wow! Okay, I'm gonna add a little\nbit of vanilla in here, just a drop. You can also add in\nany flavoring you want, even some peppermint extract. Almond extract is really\npopular, too, that's nice. Okay, so you wanna have, like,\na nice dripping consistency. This is not a nice dripping consistency, so we can add in either\na little bit of water, some lemon juice, just\nenough, drop by drop, until it's the right piping consistency. This is close, but it's\nnot right, a little thick. Just a couple drops of water. Ugh, my arm is so tired,\nI can't even tell you. (whisk scraping bowl) There we go, that looks nice and silky. If you can see, it's really pretty. Okay, if you're not\nusing this immediately, cover it, put it in a piping bag, 'cause it'll be dried\nlike that (fingers snap) when it's exposed to air,\nso cover it immediately or use immediately. Those are your two options. I'm transferring my royal\nicing into a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. This is a number three. I think a number four\nwould've worked even better, but I can't find it. You can go all out\ndecorating a gingerbread man, I'm gonna do, like, a nice\none that I think is acceptable while still having time to,\nlike, make dinner tonight and whatever else. A happy medium, if you will. So remember, this is a round tip, but if you don't have any piping tips, just snip the tip off of a pastry bag, or even a little Ziploc bag will work too. It's just kind of harder to grip. By the way, my gingerbread\nmen came out of the over. I let them cool until they were set, and, you know, you can\nlift them off easily now. They look nice. A little bit plump, but, you know, still totally recognizable\nas gingerbread people. We're gonna pipe on now,\nand ready to eat afterwards. So, I have all these random sprinkles. You can use whatever you like. These are confetti sprinkles, my favorite. They're good for, like, little eyeballs and buttons if you will. I have some snowflake sprinkles. (sprinkles rattling) Sometimes I buy stuff on Amazon with like, it's like nighttime shopping. And sometimes people send me stuff. So, I have a lot of\nvarious in sunder things in the pantry. Two button, three button. Okay, now for the face. (upbeat music) Little gingerbread man, very\nmediocre looking (laughs) (upbeat Christmas music) (chewing) Sorry, we all make sacrifices (laughs). Okay, this was really fun to make. You do have to chill the dough. It's honestly better to\nmake it the night before, have it ready, and if you\nwanna make crazy little shapes that are more intricate, freeze the dough, roll it really thin, punch the shapes out. And as you can see,\none of the hands stuck, one of them just flopped to the side, you lazy cookie, you had one job.

snuggling up with a big old mug it was something piping hot and these spice cookies they're warm and soft and bowl number one I want to combine my sugar and my unsalted melted butter and I want to cream those two together then I want to add in my egg and that's just room temperature it's really important to me with room temperature wet ingredients and blend back together and then I want to drip in my molasses thank you and I use the unsold food variety it'll say so right on the bottle it helps you spray your a cup or whatever you're using to measure it out spray it with a little oil cooking spray and it'll just come right out now all we have left to do is bring in our dry ingredients and that's what's in my bowl number two over here and that's just my flour my baking soda and spices a little bit of salt excuse me and that is already been it's been measured out and sifted it's very important to sift your dry ingredients so that you don't end up with bumps and everything is nicely well incorporated I'm gonna sprinkle that into separate additions into my bowl number one where all my wet ingredients are and practically there are the cold cookies and I think I'm gonna take my platter over to my neighbor's house just to be neighborly and as you can see I did not roll my cookies in granulated sugar you can finish off with either that or coarse sanding sugar if you'd like but I like the cookie to be chewy soft and tender throughout so most importantly I hope that my neighbor enjoys these and I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I want to thank you guys for hanging out with me this is the squishy monster and I'll see you guys soon goodbye", "GFkXNdyJ24k": "I'm excited for cookie week and this is my favorite yes you said that I didn't realize these are your favorite Mary so I've made extra for you okay yes so molasses cookies are a must during the holiday because the aromas of allspice and ginger and cinnamon filling the home and that is so important in the holidays is to create those memories of delicious foods and so this is a simple recipe it starts off with softened butter brown sugar going into there and why do you need to pack the brown sugar well it's because of the molasses the brown in brown sugar is molasses and so that's kind of why you need to pack it because you don't get a true measurement unless you do pack it down into there now when you measure out molasses honey anything like that what I always do take your vegetable spray and spray the measuring cup this helps it release that much easier so you're not trying to worry about scooping it out of there and this is fun this mixer here has been with me all of my culinary career and it keeps on just going it rattles and shakes and makes all kinds of squeaky noises now but it it's a true four it keeps going so this is gonna have not only am i using a dark brown sugar but I'm gonna use a dark molasses also and it was fun it's on sale this time of the year now once you get the molasses into there you're going to be adding also the eggs a little bit of baking soda is going in there the spices and the flour and you're gonna add that in and I wanted to just specifically show you how easy now you can see how easily that came right out of there see that at home there it just comes right out and that's the important part the important lesson with these particular cookies so I'll keep working on these giving these all together when I come back I have a fun three variation way of how to cook these that are gonna be so fun for the holidays and it's gonna fill your home with the aroma of all of these wonderful spices so I can't wait for you guys to try them on ice and I have a molasses joke to tell you a little bit later Brian okay is it TV worthy maybe not okay maybe I mean marry tell me a joke is that TV worthy give me a dollar well what we'll fight we'll find out soon hey don't go along with their final chair", "Rx7qJRN6Jeo": "Oh baby guys we have a delicious cookie recipe I'm super excited for this because Ginger Snaps are one of my secret favorite cookies we never make them I rarely ever get to eat them but I remember one Thanksgiving when Matt and I used to live in San Francisco we did like a friendsgiving and his best friend's girlfriend made like a triple batch or gingersnap cookies and I was just sneaking them all night eating them little did I know the secret ingredient is molasses so in this kitchen we've never worked with molasses this is a fresh jar of grandmas molasses that I just bought it's not something I would recommend working with unless absolutely necessary and for something like a gingersnap you're gonna want the texture and the flavor that the molasses gives one tablespoon is 15 grams of sugar since we're only using 1 tablespoon it's gonna be about a carb per cookie I think it's absolutely worth it I think you should use it it'll definitely elevate the flavor and the texture if you don't want to use it though make another cookie recipe we got plenty on our food blog chewy chocolate chip cookies pecan Sandie remakes walnut snowball cookies those are like the top three I would say but let's get to making this recipe first things first we're gonna get our wet ingredients together we have half a cup of butter softened slightly melted in here and to this we are going to add some vanilla 1/3 cup of erythritol one egg ten drops of stevia and Gramma's molasses whoa that doesn't smell good doesn't feel good too you know it smells like the ginger and soy sauce I just assumed molasses was like a very thick maple syrup but I'm completely wrong so we're gonna do about a tablespoon so let's give this a whisk oh yeah that's nice and thick okay now we're just gonna add our dry ingredients to this mixture we're gonna do 1 cup of almond flour 2 tablespoons of coconut flour just a very little half a teaspoon baking soda pinch of salt 2 teaspoons of ground ginger and then 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon now we are going to whisk that all together so I've transferred over to a spatula to make sure everything gets fully incorporated mmm that's beautiful oh it smells so nice and gingery get your oven preheated to 350 and while that's preheating we're gonna pop this dough in the fridge and let it chill for 10 minutes before we make our cookie balls all right guys our dough has chilled for 10 minutes I forgot to start recording and I've already started placing my cookies but here we have them I'm using a cookie scooper but feel free to use your hands and just form balls 1 inch thick and set them far enough apart so that when they do spread they don't run into each other okay now I'm just gonna flatten them out slightly with my finger you could use the back of a spoon if you prefer to just so they look like little disks and they should spread that's what almond flour does almond flour spreads in the oven coconut flour keeps its form cookies are ready to go so we're gonna pop them in the oven at 350 810 minutes we'll be back to taste them alright guys we're back with our ginger cookies and I was totally wrong I expected these to turn out snappy but they didn't they are actually soft bash which I am NOT mad at so very very soft we let them cool about 15 minutes maybe if you bake them a little longer because they're not burnt at all so if you bake them a little longer they might get a little more sturdier but I like soft so I feel like serving these up with like a dollop of ice cream or some whipped cream or some like berry jam that you've created would be phenomenal so I'm gonna give these a taste test and like you can see how soft they're oh man and they're so deep in color hmm you smell that ginger mmm look melt-in-your-mouth very soft and ready in a good way though because they're so rich in flavor a lot of ginger comes through really really good I think that rich deep flavor that I'm getting honestly is that one tablespoon of molasses it really makes the difference oh there's that spice of the ginger that comes through and like a gingersnap cookie we've never made a cookie that's this flavorful but they're not ginger snaps they are ginger soft but super delicious so how do you recommend you make these make them for your kids bake sale these would be great right out of the freezer a hundred percent we're gonna pop these in the freezer right after but anyway linked in the description below are the ingredients and the instructions on how to make these let us know what you think are you fine with some ready molasses II flavorful cookies all right Thank You Jeremy see you soon", "OuGfY0C19z4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you", "-UEVACilKKU": "good morning everyone hillbilly Jill here with North Texas vegetable gardening canning recipes a little bit of everything we are continuing our Christmas cookie extravaganza and today we're gonna make another one of my super favorites which is molasses cookies this is a super easy great recipe something you can do very quick so stay tuned let's get started on my delicious molasses cookies okay first we have 1 cup of packed brown sugar we have 3/4 cups of shortening 1/4 cup of molasses 1 egg 2 and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons of baking soda not powder 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground ginger 1/2 a teaspoon of ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar that we're not going to use as part of our mix I'll show you what to do super easy peasy folks right now we have in our in a large bowl in our mixing bowl we have our brown sugar our shortening our molasses and our egg and we're gonna beat this on medium until well blended okay the next step now is just to add our dry ingredients that's it so let's get going now I'm adding everything except the sugar the sugar is going to be used last now folks here's our cinnamon we've added our ginger this is our baking soda not baking powder our salt and now we're going to start adding our flour now to smell this day pick it up a little bit get it going here okay we have our oven preheating I'm 325 degrees and we are going to make about one and a half inch size balls and we're gonna roll them into the sugar here and we're gonna put them on the cookie sheet about two one and a half inches apart oh this dough is wonderful easy easy to work with and it was easy to make I love molasses cookies I'm sure many people do again this is something that we only see around Christmastime even though they're available in the store but it's not something that people make like chocolate chip cookies and if you want to know how to make chocolate chip cookies go back and look at my video and if you want to know where the Christmas cookies came from go back and look at my video on the Christmas cookies story I think you'll find it quite interesting to know that cookies Christmas cookies came about back in the early 1500s but not everybody could get the spices and the baking goods if they needed to make cookies except at Christmastime and that's where Christmas cookies came from okay I have them laid out on my cookie sheet I'm gonna put them in a 325 degree oven for about 13 to 16 minutes I am going to check them at 13 minutes this is an ungreased cookie sheet as well so stay tuned okay here they are I did have to leave them in there for 15 minutes it's very important that you get them off the cookie sheet very quickly onto a cooling rack so I'm gonna do that right now here is the finished product folks my only regret with this recipe isn't if I didn't double it if you decide to make things I suggest that you do double up your recipe this made a little over two dozen and I am just stoked about them and they turned out absolutely delicious I'm going to sit down and have mine with a glass of eggnog and speaking of eggnog if you want to learn how to make homemade eggnog there is a channel called kitchen confidence I suggest you

Ralph the camera and welcome to cavalcade of food well Ralph today we're gonna make some cookies and I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna make something kind of old-fashioned we are gonna make a ginger molasses cookie we've been wanting to make those for a while we have and we happen to happen to have a lot of molasses on hand which was sort of the inspiration to finally do this so we're gonna start with creaming our shortening which you can use butter or margarine I've got two sticks here and I'm gonna add 1 cup of just regular sugar and 1 egg we've got the egg at room temperature right which is always what we like to do when we bake and we're gonna cream this together in the mixer so we talked about creaming and really what that is is to thoroughly mix your penny' your fat and your sugar together until it's nice and fluffy or creamy looking and the color of your mixer exactly so and this this is a pretty you know if you if you have a more straw a stronger mixer like this it really doesn't take too long you see what's happening see how it's getting nice and fluffed up okay I'll let it go for another minute then over here what I've got is I've got two cups of molasses and then I've got two tablespoons of white vinegar so what I'm going to do now is we're pretty much creamed up here so we've got our cream mixture here I'm gonna put in the molasses I'm using one of these handy cups that make it easy it's going on the side it's yeah it sure is okay here we go good thing for me molasses is slow alright slow as molasses as the sinning goes but if you have the go dark did is yeah it's really dark so unless this is like a dark sugar yeah it's kind of it's a it's a byproduct of making sugar and it's you know cooked a long time all right so we've got our two cups of molasses here and then I'm gonna put in our cool tablespoons of vinegar and we're going to mix that out so we'll kind of let that do its thing in the meantime let's come on over here to our dry ingredients I've got seven cups of flour here Wow okay so this is gonna make quite a few cookies and you can put as much as eight a lot depends on when we add the flour to the wet ingredients we'll see how the batter is consistency usually seven cups should do it sometimes I might be able to put in a little more all right well we can't have ginger molasses cookies without ginger so this is two tablespoons of ground ginger and I know that sounds like a lot but we want a nice strong gingery kind of flavor I've got one teaspoon here of cinnamon and then I've got three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt all right and I'm gonna just kind of mix this together I don't have a sifter a really big sifter so what I'm gonna do is I'm using a whisk just to kind of blend all those ingredients together and when you know it's not getting all over the place there's a first time for everything oh maybe I spoke too soon okay I'm gonna come back over here look what's happening here now and we do a scrape down its militant you smell it yeah that that molasses really has that just that wonderful deep sugary butter yeah no it's got a very distinct aroma so some people make molasses cookies some people make ginger cookies but you're doing a combination of the two well yeah it's really a molasses cookie that sort of heavy on the ginger they're a gift from the Amish store where they're kind of soft if he's gonna be like that well we'll see I don't know depends on color of you honey yes how they come out so they'll be good I'll tell you that yeah and other wedding stuff so I'm gonna finish incorporating the molasses and vinegar in here and I got to get a cup of boiling water going because the next thing we're gonna do is we're going to add our dry ingredients to our wet ingredients alternately with a cup of boiling water and four teaspoons of baking soda okay that'll give our cookies the rice I'm gonna put a cup of boiling water here in the measuring cup and then again I've got four teaspoons of baking soda whoa about that they're like a little science experiment yes okay so that's we're gonna mix that in there okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to alternate our dry ingredients and our Leytonstone it yeah so we start by putting a couple of scoops of our dry and we're going to put a little bit of this I'm going to keep on going and I'm gonna pray it fits all fits in this bowl it's the largest one I am mixing will ya so well asses cookies are one of those real standards thank you so much good one of those real stand kind of old-fashioned standard cookies that ya they bring back a lot of old timey memories they do and then you know when we were kids you know we would have ginger snaps hmm which was a popular you know what's funny is I didn't like molasses cookies or ginger snaps her ginger as a flavor when I was little so much because they up because they seem so old-timey and grandmotherly I guess but that in the good way yeah but it is good but I really love as I've gotten older I think a lot of people to have kind of love the you get a ya the nostalgia of it plus you know your tastes change they say as you get older so it's true but I really love a nice soft warm molasses or ginger cookie but like I said that we've had before and time to really appreciate them so I'm glad we're finally making some of my other ones who watch the program I'm gonna put a little bit more in okay Ralph if you'd thank you for helping let's put a little splash of that in good I see that there's some baking soda that's kinda settled I'm gonna stir that up then before that goes in let me put in the rest of our dry here does it look like it's gonna fit I think so I think we're just gonna just make it go ahead okay so what you want is you know kind of a stiff dough and if I if this looks a little too soft I can always add a little bit more flour do it maybe you should scrape off the sides that's a I think that's a prime idea and of course that's part of always when you're making a batter is scraping just to make sure that everything gets nice and incorporated in so I think what I'm gonna do Ralph or see how it's kind of see how we it's not quite it needs to be a little stiffer than that if oh yeah so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go into my flower here and we're gonna start by maybe putting up about a half a cup yeah let's not put too much cuz maybe and see try that brings it together so you know I say seven to eight cups of flour and and again you just kind of have to eyeball it now this is a this is a situation here you really need a mixer either a strong arm or a drawing electric mixer yeah so this is looking pretty good I might put a little bit more in maybe a quarter cup of flour okay anyways we'll get this just right and then come on back and we'll start oh by the way oven is preheating to 350 degrees okay we are all mixed up you know so what else does no he's thinking so blue how do you just drop shot oddly I'm using the tablespoon and you know you you can make these as big or as small as you want so you don't have to worry about the preciseness of them precision because they're gonna go all kind of baked into its own shape as it yeah you're thinking you know this is kind of like a drop cookie and drop cookies are literally you're just dropping them off the spoon onto the cookie sheet cookie sheet which I'm using parchment paper here easy cleanup yeah but that's that's just my preference so you're trying to keep them kind of relatively the same size by using a tablespoon a tablespoon some people like to use those little they look like little ice cream scoops mm-hmm and those are fine too some dough like this this is a particularly kind of sticky dough maybe you can tell yeah and those don't tend to work very well in those things because they don't always come out Mosely so I wonder if you could cool this off in the freezer or something before putting it on them you could but then the dough the the downside to that is is that then you don't gets so stiff it's hard to kind of shape so I just really want these to we just sort of locks drops here on the sheet so we're our oven is at 350 degrees and we're going to do before I get these in the oven ralpherz I'm going to just get some sugar here and I'm gonna just regular sugar this is just regular sugar you could use you know the thicker Grandia that if you had the real heavy stuff the Toronado sugar nuke or whatever they call it turbinado is that what it is sure but not oh I think so you so you're just putting by hand sugar on the top okay and I'm doing this and this is an option one kind of looks nice the other thing too is again it does sweeten it up there's not a lot of sugar if you remember we only put a cup of sugar in our batter batter so these aren't super-sweet cookies and maybe you don't want super-sweet cookies but that's another thing that kind of makes them old-fashioned they yeah Oh keys we're not real sweet back then I guess and also the molasses itself is sugar so something sugary flavor they're gonna bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees then we'll come on back ten minutes in the oven this is a very kind of cakey cookie cookie for a lack of a better description but yeah it's nice if the little sprinkle of sugar on the top so we can let this rest for a world above I'm gonna give them a minute on the cookie sheet and then what we'll do is we'll transfer them here to a cooling rack okay I'll put this one here so there they are and there's the first dozen this recipe this size will probably make about eight dozen or so really yeah we'll get quite a few out of here but here's that there's still one oh yeah you just haven't been cool too", "tYevK48A8Hg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

definitely not easy to accomplish with gluten free foods 99% of the time but I promise these are actually edible for this recipe I'm using 1 to 1 baking flour mix from Bob's Red Mill but you can use cup 4 cup you'll need one of the third cups of your gluten-free flour one and a half teaspoons baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon salt 1/2 a teaspoon ground cloves 1 teaspoon ground ginger and one teaspoon ground cinnamon at room temperature you'll need one egg and one and a half sticks of unsalted butter you'll also need 1/3 of a cup dark molasses 3/4 of a cup packed brown sugar and 1/3 of a cup white sugar to roll your cookies in you also need two bowls a spoon saran wrap and an electric mixer start by combining your dry ingredients then in a separate Bowl take your butter and brown sugar and cream those together with your electric mixer this will take a minute or two so just be patient you'll want to make sure that you're scraping down the sides of the bowl as you go so that everything gets thoroughly combined when that's all creamed together add your egg and molasses and then mix that thoroughly next you'll want to lower the speed on your electric mixer and slowly add in your flour mixture until everything is completely combined then cover that with plastic wrap and stick it in the fridge for 30 minutes well that's in the fridge pre-heat your oven to 375 and grease your pans refrigerating the dough will make it easier to work with take a large spoonful of dough roll it into a ball and then roll it gently in the sugar before placing it on the pan next pop those in the oven

you enjoyed this video remember to Like share and subscribe", "aytqTgWUkmg": "Today on Sugar Spun Run I'll be\nshowing you how to make soft and chewy gingersnap cookies. Hey everyone!\nSam here and today I am sharing a soft and chewy gingersnap cookie recipe. Now\nthis recipe is by request. I personally have always felt that gingersnaps should\nbe snappy. They should be crisp and if you break them in half they should have\na nice snap to them. I mean that's why they're called ginger snaps after all.\nRight? However, a lot of you have indicated that you would like both a\nsnappy gingersnap cookie and a soft and chewy one. So today I have a soft and\nchewy version to share with you. This recipe is pretty easy. So let's go ahead\nand get started by preheating our oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Next you are\ngoing to need 3/4 cup of unsalted butter. You want this to be softened to room\ntemperature and we're gonna add it to a large bowl. Along with a butter we're\ngoing to add 1/2 cup each of granulated sugar, and firmly packed dark brown sugar. Use an electric mixer to beat these ingredients together until they're creamy and well combined. Next, we'll add 3 tablespoons of unsulphured molasses. Now at this point we're also going to add our vanilla extract, and our spices. we're going to add 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla. two and a half teaspoons of ground ginger,\n3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, and we're also\nadding 1/8 teaspoon of a cayenne pepper. Now I know this seems like an unusual\ncookie ingredient but it adds that perfect amount of spice to our ginger\nsnaps. And of course we'll stir everything together. So it should be smelling pretty\ngood in your kitchen right about now. All those spices. It's making me hungry. Alright we're also going to add one large egg and we'll stir this in. I'm just gonna use my spatula now to\nwork everything together. Make sure it's all nicely combined.\nThere's no ingredients that are sitting on the bottom that haven't been nicely\nstirred into the dough, and then we can set this aside and you're going to need\na separate bowl for your flour. You'll need two and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour. Along with the flour we're going to add a teaspoon of baking powder. 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. And of course we'll stir\neverything together until it's nicely combined. Now we'll stir our dry\ningredients into our wet ingredients until everything is nicely combined and\nwe have a nice a cookie dough. I'll usually just start by stirring\neverything together with my spatula and if the dough gets too stiff, switch over\nto the electric mixer. Once you have your cookie dough nicely stirred together we can go ahead and start baking these soft and chewy ginger snaps.\nI like to scoop the dough by about one and a half tablespoons each, and you'll\nwant to roll it between your palms just so you have a nice smooth ball of dough.\nNow this dough is soft. If it's too sticky for you to manage you can pop it\nin the fridge for about 30 minutes, but even though it's soft I usually don't\nhave a problem rolling it. Once you've rolled your cookie dough you'll just\nwant to briefly roll it through some granulated sugar. Now this is optional\nbut I really love that nice little sugary coating it gives the outside of\nthe cookies, and then transfer your cookies to a baking sheet, and make sure\nyou space them at least 2 inches apart. Now we'll take these over to our 350\ndegrees Fahrenheit preheated oven where they'll need to bake for about 10 to 11\nminutes. Once these cookies have finished baking you're going to want to let them\ncool completely on the baking sheet because they're still going to be really\nsoft and fragile and a little under baked when they first come out of the\noven. They'll finish baking on the cookie sheet and you'll have nice soft cookies\nwhen they're finished cooling. And once they've cooled you can go ahead and dig in.\nI hope you guys enjoy today's easy soft and chewy gingersnap cookie recipe and\nif you want to check out my snappy, and not soft a gingersnap version make sure\nto look for that recipe link in the description. If you guys try this one out\nI would to know what you think and I'd love to\nknow if you like I'm soft and chewy or hard and snappy. Thank you guys so much\nfor watching and I'll see you next time. mmm that's a soft cookie.", "c-jR24mlJBk": "(cheerful music) \u266a Jingle bells jingle bells \u266a \u266a Jingle all the way \u266a \u266a I can't sing \u266a \u266a but here we are \u266a \u266a Today we're making\ngingerbread cookies, yay \u266a Today, we are making Lauren\nMiyashiro's gingerbread cookies. She's our senior food editor and you might have seen\nher before on Whoa, Lo, cue Whoa, Lo. (screams) (beep) Should we lower the speed a little bit? She spent a lot of time\ndeveloping these cookies and I think they are just perfect. They're a little bit crisp on the outside and still a little bit\nchewy on the inside, and it's got the perfect\namount of molasses in it. But we're also gonna tweak\nit a little bit today, because for me, gingerbread cookies, they've got to have that punch, you know? Like, bam. They've got to have that spice factor and I think Lauren went a\nlittle bit soft on you guys with this recipe, so I'm not gonna take it easy on you. We're gonna incorporate some\nfresh ginger, orange zest, and some black pepper. - [Woman] Can you juggle the orange and the ginger--\n- No. Not gonna do that. And for those of you who say\nblack pepper is a savory spice. It does not belong in desserts. I'm not gonna say you're wrong, but hold. Try these and let me\nknow if you like them. Also, I suck at icing cookies, but you're gonna see me\nsuck at icing cookies today. We are going to be using our stand mixer because we want to get\nsome air into this butter and I'm not gonna do that by hand. A stick and a half of butter,\nsoftened, room temperature so that it's easy to take on that air that you're gonna whip\ninto it with the sugar. Then we're gonna go in with\n3/4 cup packed brown sugar. It's about 145 grams. Stream in 2/3 cup molasses. Let it all whip together until it's smooth and fluffy. Just scraping down, making sure that we got\nall of the molasses off in the bottom of the bowl and incorporate it into this, getting the mixture very even and smooth before we drop in our egg. Right now, it's looking\nalready really fluffy. You can see that the\nmolasses has lightened up and it's pretty well\ncombined with the butter. I'm going to crack and egg into it. You can see that I have\nmy egg sitting in water, and you're like, why? A trick for getting your\nfridge-temperature eggs to come to room temperature faster if you drop it into hotter water. Teaspoon of vanilla extract. Fake or pure, whatever you want to use, and then we're gonna go in with the rest of our aromatics and spices. - [Woman] Can you whisper\naromatics one more time? - Aromatics. - [Woman] Thank you. (laughs) - Okay.\n- I thought you said that you wouldn't jug, like-- - That wasn't juggling. This is just like,\nthrowing it up in the air. I can do this. All day. We're gonna hit it with\nsome fresh orange zest. Just one orange is fine. I like to go in one direction.\n(\"What Makes You Beautiful\") I like the Microplane to face this way so you're catching all of the zest. It doesn't need to fall out. Then we're gonna throw it in here, and then next, we're gonna add\na tablespoon of fresh ginger. I normally just eyeball this. I think about a two-inch piece is perfect for about a tablespoon of ginger. I don't peel the ginger. You can see that once I start grating it, the skin kind of just pulls\nitself back from being grated. Also, just make sure that\nyour ginger is well washed and even if the skin gets\nin, it's not a huge deal. And we're just gonna go\nahead and plop that all in. And then finally, we're gonna\ncrack some fresh pepper. I crack it into a ramekin to hold it. I want it on the finest setting if you have a fancy pepper grinder. I don't want huge specks of pepper to like, pop in your mouth. Unless you're into that, be my guest. I want this to be more\nof a diffused spiciness. And then we're gonna go in with\nthe rest of Lauren's spices. She calls for a tablespoon\nof ground ginger, a teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg and one teaspoon of baking soda. And now we're going to add\nthree cups and 1/4 of flour. So we're just pulsing the\nmixture until it comes together. You don't have to let it mix for too long. There might be still some\ndries on the edge of the bowl. Don't worry, we'll scrap that down, incorporate it in by hand. And then we're going to chill the dough. But before we chill the dough, we're gonna be doing something to it. Lauren calls for it to be\nplastic wrapped into a round, chilled for two hours or so, and then taking it out after\nit's chilled to roll it out, cut the cookies out. I find that sometimes, that can make it really hard to work with because depending on the\ntemperature of your room, the dough might come to temp really fast or you might have to\nincorporate so much flour, we're gonna be portioning this dough over two parchment sheets. Slap another parchment sheet\non top of each of those and then chill them. That way, we can roll it\nout to the ideal height of the cookies, thickness\nof the cookies that you want before they chill, and after they chill, you'll already have the\nperfect slab of dough to cut your cookies out of. Just make sure that\nyou're turning the paper every now and then so that the\ndough doesn't all squish out on one side. Pay attention to the underside. Sometimes, it can get a little wrinkly. You can just lift up\nthe paper a little bit and smooth it back out\nif you see any wrinkles. We're going for about 1/4\nof an inch thick right here, but if you want a skinnier\ncookie that's crisper and toastier, feel free to\nroll it out even thinner. Then we're gonna do the second sheet. So that's about the thickness that I like. Looks good, looks smooth. You can fridge these overnight, at least two hours until they're\nhardened enough to cut out, but if you throw them in the freezer, they're usually ready in 25, 30 minutes. It's been chilling for about half hour. It's pretty solid. The key to cutting a roll sheet of dough is that you want to peel back both sides of the parchment before cutting because if you don't, you can see that it's\npretty hard to peel off. If you don't peel off both sides first, it might get stuck to the bottom parchment and you don't want that. And here you go, you can just use this parchment. No waste. Love it. I have a small plate with just\na little bit of flour on top. This is for the cookie cutters so that your dough doesn't stick too much to the cutters themselves. If you're gonna use cookie\ncutters that are different sizes, I recommend that you\nput all the small pieces of cookies on one tray and all the bigger pieces\nof cookies on another tray because they're gonna bake\nat slightly different times. Small ones will take less time, big ones will take more time, so you don't want to put\nthem all on the same tray because some will burn, others won't be cooked. 350 oven, we're gonna go\nfor about 10 to 12 minutes. If you're making very, very baby cookies, they might just take eight, depending on how crisp you like it. Be right back. So now we've cut out all of our cookies and we want to make a re-roll. It's very simple, because\nit's already on parchment. You don't have to add any\nmore flour or anything. Just fold it over, gather up all the pieces\nwithout folding them too much so that you have a nice,\neven coverage of dough. Roll it out. If you have any of these lines, just lift the paper up gently and smooth it out so that they don't carry over into the cooling, chilling, resting stage. Perfect. Now we're just gonna throw it back and then you can bake these\noff whenever you want. There we go. They look nice. Slightly toasty on the edges, but because I want these\nto be a little bit softer in the middle, I'm not\ngonna carry them too far. So we're gonna let them\nchill on the sheet tray for about five to 10 and then transfer them elsewhere. If you move them right now, they're still very soft to the touch, so we don't want to ruin them. I think I need a sifter for the smoothest possible icing ever. Fun fact, icing sugar or powdered\nsugar has cornstarch in it, usually in the United States, so if you're not using any hot liquid, it might clump a little\nbecause of the cornstarch, so we're gonna sift it to make sure that we have\nthe smoothest possible icing. What are you? It's about three cups of powdered sugar, it's like 360 grams-ish followed by 1/4 cup of corn syrup, about 1/4 cup milk. We're gonna stream it in slowly to get our desired consistency, and then we're gonna add\nin about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract. A lot of people peel the cookie\nright from the parchment, and that can result in\nbroken cookies sometimes 'cause they get a little stuck, so what I like to do is peel the parchment away from the cookie so you're not exerting force\non the cookie directly. You're just letting the parchment release. This way, you won't have to have sad, decapitated gingerbread men. I mean, until you eat them, obviously. So tip, small. Bag, small snip. Open the bag. Pop the tip in, squeeze\nthe tip to secure it. Roll the bag back, plop it\ninto a glass to hold it. I like to peel the tip back so that it doesn't leak prematurely. I don't like to fill bags up\ntoo much because this way, you'll have more control over\nhow much you're squeezing out of the bag if you have a\nlot of icing in the bag. Sometimes, it gets really hard to direct where you want your icing to go. So this way, no problem. I'm so nervous. I've really never iced cookies\nuntil I came to Delish, but I think I'm just\ngonna have fun with it and you guys can make fun of everything that my cookie looks\nlike, which, you know, lower your expectations to\nincrease your happiness in life. Pro tip. - [Woman] That's amazing. - [June] Kelsey, what are you doing? - Well, clearly I'm not filming. Makinze is. - [June] Holy (bleep) - This is terrifying. This is more terrifying. - Chelsea, do you like decorating cookies? - No. This will be like, this will be like a two-second clip. (\"Think\" by Merv Griffin) (fanfare sounds) Hey, I'm doing it. - Yay. Should I make one that looks like my face when I go into anxiety attack mode? - No. - Good job. - Really?\n- Yeah. - June approved?\n- Yeah. Lower your expectations\nfor maximum happiness. Oh, what a gory death. Well, let's look at that inside. Nice little aeration there. Good structure, nice, soft middle. Crunchy edges. I think it's perfect. Mm. Go Lauren. (children cheer) I think if you love that wintry spice mix, you're gonna love these cookies. - [Woman] Are you gonna\neat this whole tray? - You gonna stop me? - Nope.

alike and subscribe to their channels ok so let's get started first you need 3/4 of a cup of butter that's been softened and 1 cup of white granulated sugar then you're just going to beat those until they're combined once whoops um once those are combined you add in 1/4 of a cup of molasses I sprayed the cup hoping that that will make the alas molasses come out easier but it looks like I'm going to use spatula after all these spatulas are so handy they come from the Dollar Tree and they've got a small side and a larger side so let's get this out get all that in there I'm also going to be adding in 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and then just mix those until they're well combined [Applause] make sure you stop at least once and scrape down the sides next you're going to add in one egg and feed this mixture until it's light and fluffy now we're going to add in two and a quarter of a cups of all-purpose flour two teaspoons of baking powder one teaspoon of cinnamon and then 1/2 teaspoon of ginger 1/4 teaspoon allspice and 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg then just mix all of this together until it's well combined start off slow so flour doesn't go everywhere all right now we're going to put them on the cookie sheet I have my cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and I have my handy dandy cookie scooper and I'm just going to clip them down on the parchment paper about two inches apart and now I just want to take the dough balls and plop them in some granulated sugar put the sugar side up on the baking pan once they're coated in sugar you want to put them into a 375 degree oven for about 12 to 13 minutes keep a really close eye on them because you don't want them to burn you want to take these out of the oven when they still look a little bit soft in the middle because you want these cookies to stay chewy I'm gonna pop these in the oven and I'll show you what they look like when they're done here they are fresh from the oven they actually only took ten minutes to bake I'm gonna leave them on the pan for a couple of minutes to cool here and then I'm going to slide them onto a cooling rack and leave them on the parchment paper that way the cookie stays softer and they don't get as crisp on the bottom here are the cookies all cooled down and I have them stacked on this plate I got 28 cookies from this recipe you could make them smaller if you like just make sure to adjust the cooking time as you can see these cookies they look amazing they're so soft and chewy you're going to love these give them a try and if you do tag me on any of my

so today we're gonna be making some ginger molasses cookie vegan ginger molasses cookies and here we go so I made a few notes for myself so that I don't miss anything but we are going to start off with the dry ingredients and it's 2 cups of flour now let me move this out of the way a half a cup of sugar one and a half cups of the ginger powder and if you like cinnamon you can add like 1/4 of a teaspoon as well so there that goes so there's a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 2 teaspoons of baking powder oh I forgot I always do a pinch of salt oh that might have been a little bit more than a pinch ok so now if you have all of this mixed in I'm gonna start with the wet ingredients and put them in and you could do either 1/4 of water where I'm going to do a milk almond milk and you can also do half a cup of melted butter or vegan butter but I was too lazy to let the butter turn to room temperature so I'm just gonna use oil and I actually use olive oil and I know that you should probably shouldn't be using olive oil for cooking probably I don't know that you could use but that's what I got and that's how we're gonna make it work I'm just gonna mix this all in and I know that we added the ginger ground powder in here but I also braided a little bit of real ginger this would probably be about half a teaspoon so I'm just gonna add this in here you could also add in some vanilla extract I think I'm gonna just opt out of that so I'm just going to roll my sleeves back because this is about to get really really messy and I'm gonna add in my a 1/4 of ginger molasses there's still a little bit of the oil in here that's why it looks a little funny and mixer on and here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] so it ended up making 17 the rest of them are in the oven and here's the teeth so they look pretty chewy good she taste the ginger and the sugar but it's not so potent it's not so crazy so this is a quick basic recipe for things that you probably already have at home - the molasses oh my Oh without that in your cupboards but for the most part that's the only thing that you really need to go by if you're in a rush if you're in a potluck for Christmas time or whatever holidays you celebrate and this is a really good one and let me know if you end up using this recipe and how it goes dream I'll be here eating recipes you", "mHANfTAOAK0": "[Music]", "7Uha2lxYTf4": "molasses

it's that time of year time to make the Christmas cookies so we thought we would invite you in to our kitchen so that you can watch us bake now these are not just any ordinary Christmas cookies these are gluten-free Christmas cookies now my aunt has really perfected gluten-free baking so I asked her to share with me a couple the recipes that she makes around this time of year and one of those recipes is my grandma's molasses cookie recipe so she is going to take a family favorite mhm and she is going to make it gluten free because in our family we have people that have silly acts we have people that have gluten intolerance and so in order to enjoy these family favorites we have to alter the recipe so really pay attention as to how she's gonna do that for us today alright so let's get started what are we doing okay so today we're going to get started it's a very simple one pop recipe and it's molasses raisin you can eliminate the raisins if you prefer but we're going to use the raisins today so the first thing we're going to do is we have our shortening base and I'm going to melt this in a heavy saucepan slowly over a low heat and turn on the stove you guys sorry okay so this is real life so all right we'll get that going a small kitchen I can just reach oh wow that is melting I'm going to measure out a quarter of a cup of molasses and I do use this molasses in the yellow jar there's one that is in the green jar and it's much stronger so I like to use some molasses in the yellow jar and as soon as the shortening melts we're going to let that cool for just a few minutes then we're going to add the molasses and the sugar that we have measured out if you want to make this an even healthier recipe you can take the sugar and do half swerve or Truvia and half organic sugar and then that will go into the pot with the shortening the molasses and then we're going to add a slightly beaten egg to that then we're going to I get to do some work right sift your dry ingredients together right and what we've done here today is we have used all gluten-free flour right here you guys there's so many on the market I mean we are not without help when it comes to gluten-free baking you know these are the different brands that we have here today but I mean there's so many out there to choose from and you get really good results from any other brands Bob's Red Mill is a good brand as well and so is King Arthur's getting free flour so you're just gonna put all the dry ingredients here and then you're going to add your spices my spices okay we're putting in some baking soda we are adding our spices salt ginger ground ginger ground cloves and cinnamon and we're just gonna do that all in here get it through the sifter yum yum yum I love it this already smells amazing and we're not even they're not even in the oven yet so we're at the stove we're melting our shortening now the original recipe calls for Crisco today we're making a healthier version so I've substituted substituted coconut oil and it's just about totally melted we're gonna let this cool for just a minute or two then we're going to add the sugar and the molasses okay very important tip we have a beaten egg that we're going to add to this if this is not cool enough when you put your egg in there it's gonna cook and you're going to have scrambled eggs your cookie dough so you want to make sure that this oil is cool enough that you're not going to cook your eggs so we've got the coconut oil that has melted its liquefied we have sugar molasses and we have a beaten egg when this is cooled down enough we're going to add the sugar and in order to make the recipe a little healthier you can add half swerve half organic sugar if you would prefer so we're just going to add the sugar to the oil and we're going to add the molasses to that and by the way this is the best handy-dandy little gadget ever it is I love it I measured the coconut oil in here first and when you do that then the molasses will slide out easier as well now again you don't want to add the egg to this too soon if you're in a hurry I have a trick for you you can take some of this oil and sugar mixture you can add it to the egg to temper it and that keeps it from descending on you from cooking right very nice and then your very slowly gonna add this in and you're gonna beat it quickly you need a whisk no this is fine you just want to make sure that your egg is not cooking in your mixture here so you're just adding a little bit at a time now again in our recipe we are using sugar we are using molasses these are going to be very sweet cookies I just want to tell you right now a lot of times we get caught up on gluten free and we think that that label means that it's healthy and while it can be healthy because we're using um the coconut oil you can limit the sugar you can do things like that you use your flowers but it's not gonna take the calories out the cookie just because it's a gluten-free cookie and we're using healthy ingredients doesn't mean you can eat 12 of them in one sitting you could eat but it's still calories in calories out you're still loading up on calories these flowers are loaded with carbs a lot of them are rice flours that cook the best the next thing I'm going to do here before we add our flour if you like raisins you will be using the golden raisins we happen to like raisins so I don't measure these yeah that looks good so it's your preference however many you would like to use but again it's the golden raisins and it's in the yellow box and I'm just going to mix that up okay most the next job is yours you can add in the dry ingredients and if you would like you can use your hand mixer to mix these in or you can just use a wooden spoon okay however you want to incorporate that let's do a wooden spoon I like wooden spoons do you just do it a little bit at a time or mix it all together I alright get my spices I got to get the spice your spices yep mixed through there perfect and we move this okay and then we just kind of put it in there right all right you just stirred and I just dump it all in how's about if I do that and yeah very good thank you oh my gosh this looks amazing I've had this recipe for a couple of years and I'm just making it right now for the first time molasses cookie recipe and it's such an honor to make one of my grandma's recipes that she only used to make around Christmas yeah and then to be able to bring it and share it with you guys this healthy way this this different way of making it and again you can do this with any family recipe you have you know especially if your kiddos have problem with the gluten they still want to have cookies and it's so much better to make your cookies at home rather than to buy the gluten-free cookies in a store because the ones in the store are loaded with a bunch of junk you know at least we know what is in this cookie we can pronounce everything is in this cookie okay so you want to just make sure that this is thoroughly next you want to make sure all the oil and the flours mix together okay and then what we're going to do the original recipe said to take the dough as it is now put it in the refrigerator and thoroughly chill it I have found that this is a really good temperature to roll the dough so instead of waiting until it's totally chilled I take my scoop and I pre form the cookies so I have my trusty little scooper here and I'm just going to press these in here so that we get a uniform size put them on your cookie sheet now after you get a few of these done I usually will take these toss them in the sugar now if I did not put these and chill them first and I just threw them in the oven right away what would happen they were totally flattened like pancakes oh okay so you want to make sure that this dough is totally chilled before you bake them okay we're getting these put on the cookie sheet you can see that they're very close together it doesn't matter we're not going to bake these right away these have to go into the refrigerator to chill now if you have time you want to make your batch of cookies when you've got some down time you can form them put them in a bowl after they've chilled pop them in the freezer and then when you have you can just turn your oven on pop these on your cookie sheet and you're good to go these I did at the beginning of the week and they're all ready to go these will keep for a long time in your freezer this way when you if you have cookies that you have frozen bring them out put them on your cookie sheet let them set at room temperature 10 to 15 minutes before you put them in your oven and you're going to be baking these 8 to 10 minutes at 350 okay so here's our taste testers on the plate we have a regular recipe the original the other recipe is made with half sugar half the Truvia or the swerve with gluten-free flour and regular shortening the other one is the regular sugar with swerve and gluten-free they're all gluten-free well two of them are gluten-free so taste them see what you think and I know that's the regular ones they'll go from there yeah the object is to taste one and then to taste the other one and see see what we like Oh see if you can taste the difference okay so I just tasted that money too bad we didn't have something to cleanse our palates put a glass of water or something and you're gonna notice that the textures a little bit different on some of them mm-hmm so you'll just have to see which one if you like them all then it would be easy to choose the original though well come on oh my gosh they taste very very similar you like that one yeah the original would be well sure okay but they're very close and tasting okay so OPA what do you think Oh interesting now they all like that one this is the one that I thought looked a little drier which we could take the time down a little bit that one is made with the coconut oil all sugar and gluten-free flour I actually like this one but I mean they taste it's it's hard really to choose because they all taste very similar I'm just gonna have this one okay the one Melissa did like this one this was half sugar half Truvia okay used the Crisco with the gluten-free flour yeah I'm sorry that's okay I mean the Crisco now is made with note zero trans fat so all right you can choose whichever you like okay so well the short of this story is here these are healthy cookies but again they are full of sugar and good things and oils and all that one stop moderation yes moderation is the key these are super yummy you guys give it a try see what you think and this is just part one and you got another part of making cookies coming up at you so another state to look at

eight minutes which is the lowest amount of time that was called for and this is what I got so I lowered the oven ten degrees and I'm gonna let it cool off some this is so disappointing I've made these cookies several times it's as if the baking gods do not love me anymore so sad I'll let y'all know how the next batch comes out these will be eaten though", "iV4U-r6BkSg": "hey everyone and welcome back to another episode of life above the clouds your guide to elevated eating with a new cannabis recipe every week my name is Lauren Gao and I am already on the holiday train this is my favorite time of year because it is all about being with friends and family and lots of laughter and joy and happiness and of course eating because I love food there are so many different kinds of Christmas cookies but this week I'm gonna start with my favorite it is a ginger spice molasses cookie something about the flavor of molasses combined with all of your favorite holiday spices like cinnamon cloves nutmeg will make your entire house smell like the holidays these cookies are also really great to give out as gifts because they're easy to make and they hold their shape really well so they won't crumble apart when you put them in a cookie tin so let's start by preheating our oven to 350 degrees and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper in a medium sized mixing bowl whisk together your flour baking soda ginger cinnamon cloves nutmeg and salt that's a lot of ingredients to remember you are just going to combine all the dry ingredients and whisk them together so there are no lumps using your electric mixer beat together your brown sugar your regular butter and your cannabis butter until it's light and fluffy then turn the mixer to low speed and add your egg and then add the molasses every once in a while I'll be sure to scrape the sides of your bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure that all the ingredients are mixing evenly with the mix are still on low speed slowly add the dry ingredients now scoop your dough onto your prepared cookie sheet by the tablespoon I love using this kind of scoop because every single cookie is going to come out the exact same size every time when you squeeze it it also scrapes the inside of the scoop so all the dough will come out in a nice round now using a flat bottom glass gently stamp each cookie with granulated sugar these cookies are ready to go in the oven we're gonna cook them for about nine minutes they will Brown a little bit on the outside but you want them to still be soft on the inside this recipe makes about three dozen cookies so I am using three tablespoons of my cannabis butter I like to use one tablespoon per 12 servings but remember when you're cooking with cannabis you always start small and wait two hours to see if you feel any effects before you eat any more our cookies are done and it smells amazing in here so here is my perfectly finished cookie it is sparkling the sugar on top and lightly Brown around the edges it's still soft when I pinch it a little bit so I know it's gonna be chewy on the inside and I cannot wait to bite into this cookie so let's not wait any more I'm gonna try it mmm show Shawn when the first flavors that hit me are all those great spices the cinnamon the cloves the nutmeg the ginger and the molasses and the brown sugar just give it this rich dark sweetness I hope you liked this episode of life above the clouds be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and give this video a thumbs up and share it with all of your friends thanks

german or pennsylvania dutch for our future generations and today we're going to make molasses cookies of course because of the molasses one of the main ingredients even though there's not a lot is molasses now the old timers had a br black strap molasses a little bit of a bite to it i prefer the mild and this is grayer rabbit br er rabbit and so what i did was in advance spray pam whoops wrong side spray pan into my measuring cup and put one quarter cup of molasses into that so we'll be using that shortly but to begin with we have two cups of flour and to that we are going to add some baking soda two teaspoons we need one cup of sugar which somewhere here here it is i have that all measured out we're going to put that into the mixing bowl and we have one cup of liquid oil now i happen to use masala corn oil and we'll put that in we're going to put in our quarter cup of molasses and while that's draining a bit i'm going to get one egg we need one half teaspoon of cloves that are ground a full teaspoon of cinnamon one half teaspoon of salt and all we need to do is take our whisk and mix it all together we're going to make one inch balls and place them two inches apart on our cookie sheet and bake them after we have them in our bag of sugar and coat them with sugar so that will be the final step it's a little thick already we're going to grease our cookie sheet with some pam you can use regular hard lard or crisco or butter if you like but i'm a fan of pam and we're going to again make about one inch balls if you need to you can refrigerate them to make them solid but i think mine are solid enough without refrigeration and then we're going to drop them in a bag coat it with some sugar and place it on our cookie sheet we want to place them about two inches apart if you want them all to be like exactly the same size you can use a scoop like a melon ball scoop and that way if you're entering a baking contest or something they can be perfect quite frankly i'm not entering a contest i'm baking these for you and my friends who i share them with so i'm going to i guess why one inch balls are close to two inches these are going to be huge cookies maybe i should cut down on the size not everybody likes molasses and just to try it we should have some smaller ones too last one and let me get these up here so you can see them that's our last one we have about two dozen cookies and we're going to put them into my baked oven right now on 375 bake them for eight to ten minutes pull them out and we want them soft and chewy so let's go get the oven fired up it's an old um gas stove and it's the only stove i have people often ask about it so you'll see it in a minute turn it on get the flame going there we go and we want to make sure there's no yellow flames the yellow flames are not the hat flames we want the blue the nice blue flames and of course the lower they are the less temperature you have here go the cookies [Applause] i'll be back in about 10 minutes with the cookies and we'll try one okay time to get the cookies out of the oven let's see how they look they look pretty yummy to me let's try one you know there's nothing better than a warm cookie and a cold glass of milk and this is our local dairy it's swiss premium and dairy pure pennsylvania made there's the cap let's get this cookie here and see if it's too hot to handle that melts in your mouth oh my gosh it's good wow you gotta try these", "C6KtI92tmw0": "hi guys and welcome to my channel if you don't know yet my name is Agnes and this is vegan up north and I usually

super simple and on the healthier side so it's going to be some molasses cookies I still had a little bit of molasses from when I was in Barbados a few years ago so I'm trying to use it up that's why I'm making the cookies right now so for this recipe I'm using some oat flour that I just made myself if you want to know how to make your own oat flour I'll put a link to that down below in the description box let's just get into the super-fun recipe I really hope you guys enjoyed this video it was really fun to make and especially yummy to eat so yeah just enjoy making it let me know what you think about it thanks for watching guys and I'll see you very soon", "Fac_E67gUFI": "hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with gingersnap cookies that's right appearances to the contrary I'm not a big cookie guy I don't really eat a lot of cookies nor do I bake a lot of cookies but with the holidays rapidly approaching I thought I'd show you a cookie recipe I do like making and eating which would be this incredibly easy and beautiful gingersnap and not only are you going to be able to do this recipe with no electric mixer this formula is going to work whether you like your ginger snaps crispy or chewy so let's go ahead and get started with the star of the show a ginger so what I have here is some candied ginger also known as crystallized ginger and we're going to be using some of this in addition to the traditional dry ginger powder so while technically optional I really think this makes this recipe very very special and what we're going to want to do is chop this up very finely before we add it to our dough and a great tip for this is to wipe your blade with a little bit of oil before you start chopping and this goes for chopping any kind of dried fruit if you rub your knife with a little bit of oil it won't get all gummed up as you chop so we're going to go ahead and chop that up pretty fine as you can see and that's going to give these cookies a whole other level of ginger goodness both flavor-wise and texture-wise ettus I'd and move on to the dry ingredients which is going to start with some all-purpose flour to which we will add some baking soda and you might be wondering well baking powder work no no won't you want baking soda we also want a pinch of salt as well as of course a generous amount of ground ginger and an equally generous amount of cinnamon we're also going to do a little touch of ground clove and then a couple optional ingredients because I do like my Ginger Snaps spicy I'm going to toss in a pinch of freshly ground black pepper and yes we're going to add some cayenne just a little pinch or a giant pinch and then we'll go ahead and grab a whisk and give this a mixing as usual to make sure all those dry ingredients are thoroughly combined and we will set that aside and move on to the wet ingredients and by wet I mean mostly buttery so we're going to start with a stick and a half of unsalted room-temperature butter and I know room temp can vary greatly so what we're looking for is butter that's not too firm and cold all right we don't want it melting but do want its Mirabal because what we're going to do is we're going to dump in some white sugar and using the back of our spatula we're going to cream all that together and in virtually every cookie recipe known to man they have you doing this with an electric mixer which does work great if you have one and really feel like cleaning it but I don't so I'm just going to use my spatula and after a couple minutes of smearing and stirring you should end up with something that looks like this then once our butter and sugar have been successfully creamed together we will go ahead and add in our mint stop candy ginger as well as some molasses which is impossible Dada quickly so I always have to basically talk about nothing for a few seconds while it finishes dripping in then we're also going to want to do just a little touch of vanilla extract of course pure and real as well as one large beaten egg and then what we need to do is go ahead and multiply this all together before we add our dry ingredients and even though I'm very experienced with this and I do know better I tried to accomplish this with a spatula because it was already dirty and in the bowl so I began to spatulate this under the delusion that if I stirred long enough and hard enough everything would come together and emulsify beautifully except rate about here I realize that's not going to happen and I thought to myself what the heck are you doing switch to a whisk and do this right and having the right tool makes all the difference because after just a few seconds of vigorous whisking this came together perfectly and yes I will admit if you use an electric mixer this does work faster and easier but assuming you're smart enough to use the whisk like I eventually did this will come out exactly the same as if you'd used a mixer okay and then once our wet ingredients are set the last step is to add our dry ingredients to that bowl and simply mix this with a spatula until the flour just disappears and while this is not difficult you want to start out slow otherwise you might have flour flying out of the bowl and this really is not that temperamental of a dough so don't worry too much about over mixing but as I've said many times before why would you want to mix if you don't have to so all we're going to do here is mix that with a spatula until the flour disappears and your mixture looks like this at which point we're going to stop and not make cookies because what we need to do before we form our cookies is wrap this up and chill it in the fridge for about an hour or until it's firm so that's what you see me doing here I'm going to wrap it up I'm going to pop it in the fridge for about an hour and as you'll see that dough will have firmed up very nicely so once our dough is chilled we're going to go ahead and portion it up and for that I like to use this little sorbet scoop which gives me exactly a teaspoon and a half and of course you could just use a teaspoon to do this but by using the scoop you are going to get more uniform sizes and then once we scooped our dough what we want to do is toss it into some sugar and roll it into a nice smooth ball before placing it on a parchment paper lined baking sheet but wait there's more we're going to take something flat I just use a ramekin and we're going to flatten that out and once that's been accomplished we'll sprinkle that with a little more sugar and that's it so we'll continue on scooping our dough tossing it in sugar and rolling it into a nice smooth ball and then like I said we'll place it down on parchment paper although a Silpat will work here and by the way if you use the classic 3 2 3 2 3 Positioning System you'll get what became known as the baker's dozen which is going to give me 13 perfectly spaced cookies and once that dough's been panned up we are ready to head over to the oven where we are going to bake these at 350 degrees for between 10 and 15 minutes depending on how crispy you want them so this pan here I cooked for the full 15 minutes after which they're going to look like this beautifully beautifully browned and since this batch is the crispy batch we can let those cool right on the pan and don't worry if a couple are touching once he's cooled down a little bit you could just snap them apart and if you do cook them about 14 to 15 minutes you're going to end up with a classic crispy gingersnap or as I did with this half dozen you could just cook them 10 or 11 minutes and you're going to get something that comes out a little bit more on the chewy side which by the way if you wanted to stay that way you want to get them off that hot pan so I'm going to slide those off and as you can see when you go to snap these they don't snap they just sort of Bend apart and while they still might be a little crispy around the edge that Center still should retain a little bit of chewiness so I'm gonna go into detail on the blog post about times and textures but bottom line you're gonna have to decide you guys are the Wookiees of your cookies and speaking of wiki let me go ahead and chewbacca another one of these so I can brag a little bit more about the taste which is incredible these have what I consider the classic gingersnap flavor which is predominantly ginger and cinnamon but because we added that black pepper and cayenne these have a gorgeous extra spicy finish that I think you're going to find incredibly incredibly addictive I mean if you can somehow eat less than eight or nine of these I'm going to be very impressed they are just that good and one thing I find kind of interesting the stack on the left only cooked 10 or 11 minutes in this stack on the right cook for almost 15 and yet they look virtually identical so really the only difference will be the texture and which do I prefer probably the crispy one I mean these are afterall called ginger snaps not ginger silently Ben departs but either way you're talking about an amazing cookie experience so I really do hope you give this a try soon head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts and wonderful as usual and as always enjoy you", "Or_WhL16xaw": "molasses cookies are the ultimate holiday cookie I mean I've been eating them

I have some vegan gingersnap cookies for you and these are just like the perfect holiday cookies you can have them for dessert you can have them for a snack with teeth I actually wore this sweater today for this occasion because it reminds me of gingersnap cookies so this video is super exciting because it is a collab with Kaitlin shoemaker and if you guys don't know her which I see we do because she has an amazing channel she is a vegan youtuber we actually did a collab in person around this time last year at the thrive market headquarters and she is just the absolute sweetest and funniest person she's a great person to be subscribed to but basically we teamed up to each create a vegan cookie recipe for the holidays and I'm just going to let her pop in and tell you guys a little bit about her recipe before I get into this one hey everyone my name is Kaitlin shoemaker and I run the YouTube channel Kaitlin shoemaker but I also have a website called from my Bowl and on both of those things I post easy to follow and simple vegan recipes that are most often gluten free and a little on the healthier side but they still taste really delicious because I believe that plants can taste yummy and you don't need animal products and that's basically the premise of a whole job but anyways today we're talking about cookies so I made some yummy almond flour cookies I just filmed the outdoor taste test for my channel so I've already eaten most of one but they're nice and crispy on the outside have a chia jam in the center so if you want to figure out how to make these after you watch lives video you can go ahead and click the link in the description and check out mine so hope to see you there okay so make sure you guys go check out Kaitlyn's recipe after you finish watching this one but but that is everything I have to say for now so let's get into it in a large mixing bowl add the almond flour and brown rice flour followed by cinnamon ground ginger and baking soda then whisk that together until it's all combined in a separate bowl add your softened vegan butter brown sugar and molasses and then use a hand mixer or a spoon to beat that until it's light and fluffy [Music] then just add the dry mixture to the wet mixture in two parts and stir to form a dough [Music] use your hands to roll one tablespoon size balls of cookie dough and spread them out on a baking sheet then bake in a 375 degree fahrenheit oven for about ten to eleven minutes until golden brown then let it sit for about one minute on the pan before placing onto a cooling rack and enjoy okay the cookies are done I've got my very go mug filled with some almond milk and I'm going to try one because who doesn't like cookies in the milk right mmm I seriously love these if you don't want these gluten-free and you just do a direct substitution of all-purpose flour these will still work but they won't be as thin and crispy so when I tested them with regular flour they're a little bit more like thick and puffy and a little bit chewier whereas for these I wanted them to be nice and thin and light and crispy super good for dipping in tea or almond milk I really hope you guys enjoyed this video I had so much fun testing this recipe and putting this video together for you guys so I really hope you try it out and if you do let me know you can tag me on instagram and twitter i am at it's live beyond both that is everything for today thank you guys so much for watching i love and appreciate you all so much and i will see you guys next week bye [Music]", "dOSuzeFNv-I": "welcome to cooking with Glenny Katie we make a shooting with our family what a beautiful day it's sunny just perfect out here on the beach yes and it's also November which is when my mom and grandmother who we called Nana would always make their beloved Moravian molasses cookies my mom loved making the cookies every time we came to our resort here on Hilton Head Island and I remember that I used to hold the cookies up and look to see if she could see the light through it and she could see light through it she was saying yeah they're thinning up and lay it back down again and keep on cut wonderful memories we shared making Moravian molasses cookies yes and we can't wait for you to join us it's gonna be fun we're gonna start with 2 cups of brown sugar make sure it's packed down there we go next I'm going to add 3/4 of a stick of margarine let's get this open up up into the bowl next I'm going to add two cups of molasses we use grandmas so I'm going to add one cup and then measure out the second cup oh look at that now I'm adding in the second cup hmm now I'm going to add almost 1/2 a cup of shortening we are using Crisco there we go next I'm going to dissolve one heaping tablespoon of baking soda and 1/4 of a cup of boiling water all right it's almost dissolved now I'm gonna add this to the mixture now I'm going to stir everything and finally I'm going to add in 6 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour one and a half tablespoons of ginger 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of cloves so now let's add this in as I pour I'm gonna start stirring so it doesn't get overwhelming there we go and now we're just gonna mix this all in together until a dough is formed I started mixing with my hands the spoon only went so far with getting everything blended but as you can see definitely becoming a dough consistency before we know it the dough is gonna be ready we're gonna let it sit for at least eight hours but ideally you would leave it overnight and then bake the next day don't refrigerate the dough simply put a towel over top of the bowl and leave it on your counter it's time to roll the cookies out so here's the cookie dough I'm just gonna take a handful and it needs to have some flour one so I'm just gonna put it in here this is a cloth we have down and I'm just going to get some flour on both sides now I'm going to roll the dough and I'll keep on rolling until very very thin okay I've taken it and I've rolled it back up about fill the whole board with the dough because I just want to start cutting there's one there's no I just keep on doing this until I go throughout the entire piece of done notice how thin it is and you can really see my fingers through the cookie I finished cutting the first pan of cookies I'm gonna bake him at 275 for ten minutes now they're ready to serve we'll see what the grandkids think about at least these are ready to face you've been talking about it the whole time they've been cooking you want to be our tester didn't you yes it won't be good this is what your Nana's mom used to make and then animate see you guys are really good thank you you like it yeah it's a crunchy [Music] okay with the cookies turned

show you guys I saw this recipe hold on never prepared had to have my spatula I saw this recipe a long time ago and one of my favorite cookies is molasses and Stephanie loves them and I made some last week but this recipe is really different and it's called saucepan molasses cookies and what it calls for is for you to melt your butter on the stove slowly then you add your brown sugar and your molasses and then you take it off the heat and you mix in your egg and vanilla and then well it called for a 3 quart saucepan and then after you do all that you add your dry ingredients now didn't say to mix your ginger and all that stuff in your flour but I did now here's the catch the only 3 quart saucepan I have is that silver one that I bought that was a big mistake because you all know the handles get hot and do I ever remember that no so what I'm doing is I'm using my saucepan that is this big it looks big on the camera doesn't it but it's not gonna hold I don't think it would hold everything so my flower my dry ingredients are in my beautiful pink Pyrex Bowl so let's take a look-see in how we're doing okay my butter is melting and I can't wait to see how these turned out now it calls for 375 degree oven and I've I have finally realized that I need to put my oven down 10 degrees because my pans are dark one of these days I'm going to get a silver one and I'm gonna see if it makes a difference and if you're making a lot of cookies you can always use an extra pan okay so in goes the brown sugar one of my favorite ingredients and [Music] molasses Oh me now the reason I love spatulas is because you can get every last little gooey bit out of your measuring cups that's important I think so we're going to mix all this together now that was I'll put a link to the recipe if it turns out good and 2/3 a cup of butter 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar a third cup of molasses teaspoon of vanilla one egg and then a half a teaspoon I'll put the recipe in there I don't want to fun-sized away this is amazing science isn't it let me look at something right quick okay there's no time limit that I wanted to make sure because this is such a different recipe I wanted to make sure I didn't screw it up well maybe I have so you take it off the heat and then you add your vanilla and your eggs I don't know I y'all I can't imagine putting an egg into a hot mixture am I gonna have stir-fried rice I don't know I hope not okay let's see here nobody always put your lids back on or your have vanilla all over your countertop don't ask me I know that okay oh I should be letting you watch this huh now I'm gonna use my favorite tool my whisk with the wooden handle and to put the egg in well DJ you got a little egg white there on the stove that was good well it wouldn't be DJs you didn't spill or do something okay so now well the egg doesn't look like it's cooked in there or anything but it sure I don't know this the butter ring what do you all think you see but anyway it'll probably be fine when I draw mixture which we're gonna do okay so here's my dry mixture already now supposably after you do this step and you're supposed to just be able to scoop the cookies I don't know but we're gonna find out I don't want to look down here not at me okay and she goes no where's my spatula there it is all that I was kind of surprised that you didn't like have to bring her butter and brown sugar kind of to a little bit I didn't say to so let's see how this is gonna go y'all I love this so much I'm always thinking I better find another one I better find another one if anything happens to this and I mean I baby it when I don't suck this in water I wash this right away I just my wooden handle I try to be really careful with it how is that gonna make a cookie thank you think if it sits a minute I doubt everything yo okay doubting Thomas I don't know y'all that's you can't scoop that what should I do two and a quarter cups all-purpose flour and that's when I put in there okay two thirds of cup of butter and I made sure I got eleven tablespoons which is what it is three quarter cups of brown sugar and a third a cup of molasses one egg teaspoon of vanilla two and a quarter cups of flour baking soda baking powder cinnamon and ginger which I use allspice for ginger which is allowable think maybe it's sticking up a little bit don't I'm gonna be so mad if these cookies don't turn out now what it says to do is stir in all remaining ingredients until just combined okay that's what we did drop by rounded tablespoons full now I've got my bigger thingy I don't know how much that holds I've never tried it I don't think it really says but anyway this is the one I always use unless I'm making some cookies for the kiddies but bake seven to nine minutes or until set well I don't know now this time y'all I was extremely careful about my ingredients and how I was supposed to do them I just cooked a batch of cookies once and I froze in little nuggets so I'm scared John I don't think this is gonna work you think I could make a bar cookie and then like a small pan okay y'all are gonna see it right here I love using these scoops okay look at that is that sticky or what I'm thinking those might spread more so I'm gonna space them out one I won't be amazed y'all if these turn out I mean I could be wrong but I'm gonna pop them in the oven set my timer for the lowest amount of time seven minutes and and I don't I can't I don't think my video will pause you for that long and so I'll have to make this in two little videos and I'll hook them together so y'all I hope these are going to come out we'll see now there I bet you they are not gonna be the flat chewy kind but we'll see anyway hang in there I'll be back okay yeah I took the cookies out of the oven my second batch you can see those right there just came out I might put a couple more on there than last time and they did okay and these are the ones that came out initially I've got some macaroni and cheese going on over there cuz mr. Terry I'm going to get him for lunch and we're gonna have meatloaf and mac and cheese he loves that okay so I'm gonna taste one of these cookies y'all uh they don't look quite like the other ones oh no not goodbye there okay I wouldn't be afraid to serve them some you know serve them to someone but they are not as good as the other ones not not quite and I don't know what the difference is now of course I have to finish this one and of course I had to eat one of those because they're just about my favorites cowboy cookies but I've been taking advantage of our cooler weather a little bit so y'all these cookies were okay and I'll put the recipe in the link but they're nothing special the other ones really are better so I better let y'all go it's never good for me to do more than one thing at a time and I've got to going right now so I'll talk to y'all later do something fun today please be safe love y'all gotta go get Terry in a few minutes - bye now you know I have an awesome visitor from out of state she's out doing some fun stuff I'll talk to y'all later bye now you", "EP5J8IVQ_Nk": "Hi and welcome to Bold Baking Basics! This is where we get into the fundamentals\nof baking. These videos are about getting you to bake\nwith confidence, anytime anywhere. So, molasses, also known as treacle is dark\nsugary syrup with an almost kind of bitter taste to it. It is used a lot in baking to get a dark color\nand also a caramel flavor. I do know that it's not available worldwide\nso I'm gonna show you how you can make a fantastic molasses substitute to use in your baking. As always the recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com\nand make sure you check out my website because I've got loads more videos and recipes over\nthere. Okay, let's get started. So over here I've got a heavy-bottomed saucepan,\non the stove, and we're just gonna add a few ingredients into it. The main ingredient for this recipe is a dark\nbrown sugar. Now you need this because it gives it all\nthe flavor and the color. So we're just gonna add that straight in there. Next we're going to add a little bit of water\nto make it nice and syrupy. Now because we're making some sort of kind\nof a caramel situation going on here, we want to make sure that it doesn't crystallize and\nhow you can do that is adding cream of tartar. It's an acid that will stop your sugar from\ncrystallizing. I recommend you always have this in your kitchen,\norder it on amazing, it's a few dollars, and then you always have it to hand. You often see it in cookies, maybe my homemade\ncorn syrup, different things like that, it's always handy to have just a little bit close\nby. So in you go. Okay, last but not least, some fresh lemon\njuice. This also prevents the sugar from crystallizing\nso don't forget about that guy. In you go. So that's it, all you have to do is turn on\nthe heat to roughly around a medium, let the sugar dissolve, and then we're gonna bring\nit to a simmer. At the beginning just give your mix a little\nstir so everything is well combined. So once you see it coming to a simmer the\nnext step actually happens really fast. It will only take maybe 3-4 minutes. But I'm gonna show you exactly what to look\nfor rather than timing it. So as you can see now, it's a very thin dark\nsyrup. And it's just pouring off my spatula. In around 203 minutes you'll notice that syrup\ngetting a little bit thicker and pouring slowly off your spatula. It means that your caramel is forming. Do you see that? How it's kinda slowed down? And it's taking longer to drip off the spatula. This is a technique you use in caramel-making,\ncorn syrup, stuff like that. So if I give you these telltale signs, you\ncan real nail this recipe, timing can be a little bit different, there can be lots of\ndifferent factors that can affect it. But if you know exactly what to look for,\nyou're gonna get the same result as I did. Okay so this is what we're going for, it's\nbeen 4 minutes, do you see how it's slowly dripping off my spatula? That is what you want. It's formed more of a caramel, it's getting\nthicker, now here is what I want you to do, and this is just in general. Always be a step ahead of yourself. This, when it goes cold, will actually get\nvery syrupy and much thicker so you might be thinking right now it doesn't look like\nmolasses and it doesn't, but once it goes cold it will. So turn it off the heat, set it aside to cool\ndown, and then we'll check on it. This makes quite a lot of treacle, you're\ngonna get around a cup, cup and a half, do that'll be plenty for your baking for a few\nweeks. So while our molasses is cooling down I want\nto show you something. Do you see how this is all kind of crystallized\nand granulated? This can happen to your molasses, but do not\nworry, you can totally fix it, what you want to do is just pop it into the microwave or\neven into a little pot over the heat, and just heat it up until that sugar dissolves\nand then you can use it just as you would regular molasses. It's as good as new. So once your molasses substitute has cooled\ndown, go ahead and pour it into a jar. There's loads of big & bold recipes you can\nuse this molasses substitute in, my crockpot gingerbread, my soft and chewy molasses cookies,\nmy homemade bran flakes, and my ginger crinkle cookies. So if you liked this recipe, you are gonna\nlove what's over on my website. Head over there and check out other Basics,\nlike how to make a corn syrup substitute and your own homemade cream cheese.

cups of flour 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 cup of sugar 1/2 teaspoon of ground clove 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon of salt 3/4 cup of melted butter 1/4 cup of

on the side this dough for about an hour and we'll be back now we're now in this fast we're gonna get the dope out of the bowl and we're gonna roll you can divide into pieces to make it easier they just want a row [Music] and now you with a knife you just cut to pieces okay down one I'm gonna roll and I have some sugar in here you're just gonna dip on the sugar and put it in a tray they don't forget to hit the oven and 375 for a night now that we've finished making the balls that fits on a tray you're gonna bake for ten minutes until the surface it's cracked we'll be back [Music] ten

see you all next time bye", "I5L0gk2hxzA": "hey everyone today I'm gonna be showing you a ginger molasses cookie recipe that I've taken a strong liking to just a couple of things before we get started though I usually use this kind of molasses you can get it at Walmart and for the brown sugar I almost always use dark brown sugar and then we're gonna be rolling these cookies in the sugar before we bake them I mean you can use regular sugar it looks perfectly fine but just me I prefer to use the raw sugar because it's bigger chunks of sugar to me it kind of looks like little icicle sprinkles on the cookies or little snow crystals it sort of adds to the holiday charm okay so let's get started on the recipe pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees I guess the first thing we're gonna do is take two cups of flour just regular all-purpose flour and we're gonna blend it together with two teaspoons of baking soda you just want to sort of blend those together really really well you could also put it through a sifter if you want to I just don't have one right now all right so we got our dry ingredients now we're gonna work on the wet ingredients someone's gonna be a stick of butter which is about half a cup of butter and you want to try to use softened because it's just easier to work with and to that we're gonna add 1/3 cup of granulated sugar and a quarter of a cup of packed brown sugar I had someone asked me the other day what do you mean packed you know I don't bake that much if you're if you're not a big Baker and you're not sure what they mean by packed it basically just means when you put the brown sugar in you want to pack it down don't just pile it in there loosely because it's kind of sticky and it's an illusion that the cup is full when it's not because it fluffs up so you do have to pack it down most recipes tell you to do that and now you're just going to cream these together until they're very well blended you can also use a food mixer or a handheld beater all right so now we're going to add our spices it's going to be a teaspoon and a half of ground cinnamon that's wine and I have a 1/2 teaspoon measurement but you can just eyeball it that's half a teaspoon of ground ginger I'm gonna kind of level it up ginger tends to get a little lumpy as a powder so just when you're blending it make sure all the ginger breaks up good and you're gonna need about half a teaspoon of salt and then this is where you add your molasses I love this part it's my favorite so this nice dark rich molasses I love to watch it pour for some reason it's satisfying in a weird way so you need whoa that's the hard part is getting it to stop pouring and then I usually have to wipe that off and then you just go ahead and pour that and I like to use the side that has the spout it seems to work better of course so I'm gonna get all of it so I'm just gonna use my knife here to kind of scrape it all down in you know someone told me that brown sugar is actually just regular sugar with molasses mixed in I don't know if that's true or not if anyone else out there knows feel free to put your two cents in it so now you just want to blend all this together all right now we're gonna add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients let's go ahead and dump it on in and go to work blending that together you can use your hands once it starts coming together a little bit better I may or may not do that we'll see ok so update I did get lazy and use my hands to mix this it was just so much easier than using the spoon you can also make this go ahead and freeze it if you want or refrigerate it keep it in advance to make life a little easier on yourself I like my cookies a little on the big side so they're probably gonna be a little closer to the size of golf balls and then what you do is you just dip it in the sugar sort of roll it around and then put it sugar side up on the baking sheet ah this reminds me of the days where my mom was still around and she she and I would sit down and make a bunch of cookies for the family we just make a batch after batch and decorate them I think this is probably a little too soft to put in you know to use for cookie cutters maybe if you rolled it out between two sheets of parchment paper and flattened it and then sort of used a cookie cutter and just peeled the extra stuff away I don't know I've never tried it I've always done these round so if you do try it let me know how it turns out maybe I'll try it one time I don't know this is just easier for me and kind of fun alright then into the oven they go for eight to ten minutes depending how hot your oven bakes you want to check them and rotate the pans halfway through all right so it's about halfway through the baking time we're going to go ahead and rotate these cookie sheets it's not a good idea not to rotate them they can get darker on one half of the sheet than they do on the other and that's not very pretty so this is how they look when they come fresh out of the oven they're a little puffy right now as they cool down they'll sort of deflate as you say actually to deflate them better I sometimes it'll tap the I'll do that a few times to deflate them deflating them a little sooner sort of helps retain their chewiness I find so you could try that out if you want you see this is what I mean that nice smooth toasted background and those smooth not burned edges around the sides the parchment paper really is great actually you know I don't even have to scrape these look right off the pan they slide around that's why I love parchment paper so much here they are plated up you see what I mean the little crystals of sugar are really really pretty after they're baked it kind of gives it a snowflake effect some of my family members got some of these last Christmas I baked him and shipped him out to him you want to make them at home give this recipe a try let me know how it goes thank you for watching have a great day", "R39UIl2wm4U": "oh pardon me and my Swiss do pop says I'm insatiable I sure can't deny it today because today we're going to make my famous molasses cookie pop used to bring all the fellas home from work just to give them a taste of my gritty first we're going to cream together the wet stuff three-quarters of a cup of shortening one cup of sugar and one egg then we add the molasses three-quarters of a cup will do in another bowl we mix together the dry stuff two cups of flour a teaspoon each of cinnamon ginger and salt and 2 teaspoons of baking soda now we add the dry to the wet and mix it up real good and refrigerate for two hours this makes about four dozen cookies by the way enough to make a lot of hungry man happy orchids whatever this batter is already chilled and now we're going to

between blackstrap molasses and fancy molasses well margles blackstrap molasses is a byproduct of the sugar refining process while fancy molasses is made directly from pure sugar cane blackstrap molasses has a strong bitter taste to put hair on your chest and your husband probably wouldn't favor that unless it's into that kind of thing till Margil if a recipe calls for just molasses for the love of all things sacred use Crosby's fancy molasses sweet Mother Superior that's delicious no wonder on the first to sell out at the big jail there's not a man in town doesn't want my cookies for more of my sweet stuff go to crossfit com", "0wd2gzKsXtE": "[Music] hey everyone happy holidays and welcome back to my Channel today I wanted to share one of my favorite Christmas cookie recipes which is for soft and chewy ginger molasses cookies of course they are vegan they're also considerably healthy especially compared to other Christmas cookies they kind of are a cross between a cookie and a cake and to me they taste like something you'd buy in a bakery and not something you'd expect a health-conscious vegan to give you so I really hope you enjoyed this video and you can try this recipe out yourself let's get baking so here's all the ingredients that you'll need to make the cookies and I wanted to point out if you want to make these gluten free all you have to do is use gluten-free oats instead of regular oats so first you'll need to make two flax eggs and just combine two tablespoons of ground flax seed with five tablespoons of water and just set that aside to sit for about 10 minutes to thicken up then mash up just half of a banana that's all you'll need for this recipe and make sure it's super ripe and spotty because the riper it is the sweeter it'll taste and the sweeter the cookies will be start by adding all of your dry ingredients to a mixing bowl so you'll need 2 cups of oat flour 1/3 cup of coconut sugar 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon each of ground ginger nutmeg and cloves and also 1/4 teaspoon of salt and then the last dry ingredient which is one teaspoon of baking soda and just give that a whisk to combine everything and then on to the wet ingredients which is going to be one teaspoon of vanilla extract the two flax eggs your half mashed banana and 1/4 cup of molasses [Music] and then just stir everything to combine [Music] and then I like to roll the cookies in a bit of sugar I'm using cane sugar because it has a bit of a crunch to it which goes really well with these cookies it makes for a bit of like a sweet crunchy outside and then the cookies have a really soft and chewy inside you could also use regular sugar if you wanted or a coconut sugar or no sugar if you want to and then scoop out the cookies so they're about the size of the golf ball and use your hands to roll them into a circular shape and just transfer them right into the sugar and give them a quick little roll around and then onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper using a glass press down the tops to flatten them and give them a cookie shape and then bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about eight to twelve minutes and that's pretty much it they have a cake like consistency they're soft and chewy and all the spices give them a really nice festive taste perfect for the holidays and they're also a lot more healthy than traditional Christmas cookies so I hope you really enjoyed this video I can try this recipe out yourself happy holidays and happy baking", "72G6UHaTnCM": "hello its AUSA and welcome to my kitchen and today we're making gingerbread men and women with pants on so these are awesome cookies and this recipe makes about 60 60 cookies say I have their each a stack of 10 here yummy these cookies beat anything that you buy at the store I find the gingerbread cookies at the grocery stores and stuff there's so much sugar in it way too much sugar and there's not one no nice flavor so so we have 3 cups of all-purpose flour we've got 3 teaspoons of cinnamon and 3 teaspoons of ginger 1 teaspoon of allspice 1 teaspoon of cloves 1 teaspoon of nutmeg so 1 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of black pepper 1 teaspoon of baking soda and the make sure there's no clumps or especially in the baking soda that's the careful when you're mixing it you'll want to do it slowly because if not ill you've got a big cloud dust [Music] so this is a hundred and seventy grams of unsalted butter and I just softened it in the microwave for about thirty seconds so we have half a cup of brown sugar and it's as packed in what I do I put a bit of oil into the measuring cup so that way it's easier it won't stick so much we add your molasses we add one large egg now we add our flour mixture [Music] slowly mix this so now you want to divide the dough in two and wrap it in plastic wrap so now place the dough in the fridge for about an hour and a half okay so we take our dough out from the fridge and as you can see this is quite hard so when you roll it out to have too many cracks you can wait about five to ten minutes for the dough to warm up before rolling it out so we're gonna work with one dough at a time you make sure you use a lot of flour because the dough is quite sticky and when you cut your little people out they'll get stuck to the top counter and you want to try and get all the dough to be the same thickness so that way when you bake them they'll cook at the same the same the same rate so mine are pretty thin they're about 0.5 of a centimeter okay you preheat the oven to 350 degrees and you bake in the middle rack for five to six minutes so to check them you you get your spatula and you lift it up and then you're gonna cause this has holes in it so you lift it up and you check if it's golden brown so these are ready so you put them on a cooling tray to cool down and then now you continue rolling out the next the next ball of dough and baking them and putting them on the cooling tray until you're all done so we're all done there you go sixty little people so that's the end of this tutorial thank you so much for watching bye bye bye bye wave for a wave I won't bring my arm I don't want

cookbook the nutritionist kitchen the first one i want to show you is for spiced whole wheat ginger and molasses cookies and they do not disappoint they're delicious they're made of whole wheat pastry flour there's no refined sugar in the recipe they're so good let me jump in and show you how to make them okay so first up we're going to mix all the dry ingredients into a bowl so that's our whole wheat pastry flour we have some baking soda i'm going to do half a teaspoon of salt and then we're going to do all these spices which is what makes the cookie so good so we have cinnamon and cloves some ginger and cardamom i love cardamom and then we're going to whisk these together and set it aside i'm going to pull the mixing bowl off and i'm going to use two sticks of butter and you're probably thinking what's a dietitian doing with all that butter butter is delicious the right kind of butter can actually be considered a healthy fat so we look for organic grass-fed butter and ideally it's from animals that were raised humanely as well you can read more about that on my website carlyles.com okay and we're going to cream that with the standing mixer with my coconut sugar so this is considered a low glycemic index sugar unlike cane sugar making this a little bit healthier and we're going to cream them together until they're light and fluffy okay next you're going to add in one egg and you're going to mix that in then you're going to add in your molasses now molasses is one of those really magical and nutritious ingredients it's loaded with iron copper magnesium it's a really nutritious ingredient and it gives these cookies this rich flavor that is unbeatable so it must include so next we're going to add in our dry ingredients okay then i'm going to grate some fresh ginger so if you buy organic ginger you don't actually have to peel the ginger the peel is really soft and it's totally okay to eat so you just go right into using a microplane to grade it if you have a box grater that works just fine just use the small grater ginger's been studied to be anti-inflammatory and it can even help with nausea during pregnancy which may be in the first trimester i had to deal with a little bit so some ginger tea really helps a mama out okay let's add that in so it's fine to go in all at once and then it'll just mix in okay that's it so we're gonna take this out and it's okay if there's some dry parts that haven't mixed in yet you can do that in the bowl with your spatula i have two pans prepared ready to go in the oven at 350 and they've been lined with parchment paper and i'm going to roll golf ball sized cookie balls out and then bake them for about 10 to 12 minutes and your dough should be really soft and you can smell so gingery and spicy and good we're gonna taste even better okay now that we have our cookie dough rolled out into balls i'm going to bake it for 10 to 12 minutes at 350. and voila finished cookies ready for the eating and

everyone and welcome back to vlogmas if you're new here my name is caitlin and i've been posting some baking videos as well as all my other vlogs videos this season so if you would like to stick around make sure you hit the subscribe button to hang out today we are making some ginger molasses cookies and these are not going to be like hard ginger cookies these are like really soft and chewy ginger cookies which are my favorite i'm not a big fan of like gingerbread but i love the taste of them but i love like a soft cookie so that is what we are making today i will leave the recipe link down below but i'll also let you know everything that i am using and without further ado let's get baking so what you will need for this recipe is 3 4 cups of salted butter 1 cup of brown sugar one large egg a fourth a cup of molasses two and a half cups of flour two teaspoons of baking soda one teaspoon of cinnamon a teaspoon of nutmeg a teaspoon of ginger and you will need salt and sugar so the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to cream together the butter and brown sugar and then that is until they are fluffy and then you are going to mix in the egg vanilla and molasses until it is completely [Music] combined [Music] dressed in golden red garlands and ribbon [Music] once that is done uh in a separate bowl you're going to mix together the flour baking soda salt and the spices and then you're going to add to the wet ingredients until combined and then you will chill the dough for two hours or overnight we're just gonna do it for two hours like a though cut tree all the angels are singing [Music] [Music] of fresh pine tree i get down on my knees [Music] [Music] okay so it is about so two and a half hours later the dough is nice and chilled so we are just going to unwrap it from the saran wrap and basically now all you're going to do is lightly grease a pan set your oven degrees to 350. um and then you're just going to roll these into little balls and roll them in some sugar and then put them on the tray and put them in the oven now we realized after this was made that we did use baking powder instead of baking soda for the recipe so i don't know if these cookies are going to turn out so we're going to cross our fingers hope for the best but they might not turn out so i'm okay with that i understand um but yeah so i'm gonna do that [Music] now [Music] [Applause] [Music] for you and me [Music] [Music] is okay here are the finished cookies they're not as chewy as they should be because i messed up and i put baking powder baking soda but they are still delicious they still taste very good so yeah so that is my video for you guys today thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed it please make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel for more and i'll see you guys in the next one bye [Music]", "oBWqSkmDkIM": "[Music] hi my name is froze and today I wanted to show you my favorite recipe for molasses cookies let's start with the ingredients okay the first thing we have is one and a half cups of vegetable shortening we have two cups of brown sugar two eggs a hint a half a cup of molasses we have four and a half cups of flour I'm going to use one teaspoon of salt four teaspoons of baking soda I'm going to use two teaspoons of cinnamon two teaspoons of ginger and one teaspoon of cloves I also have about a quarter cup of sugar that I'm going to roll the cookies in first I have the 1 and 1/2 cup shortening I'm going to put the 2 cups of brown sugar the 2 eggs and a half a cup of molasses okay now I'm going to blend that until it's well mixed okay now I'm going to add the dry ingredients okay the first thing we're gonna add the dry ingredients is the four and a half cups of flour one teaspoon of salt just put your spices right on top of your flour because that's where you're gonna mix everything with your fork 4 teaspoons of baking soda 2 teaspoons of cinnamon two teaspoons of ginger and 1 teaspoon of clothes there I have all my dry ingredients just right on top of my wet ingredients and just mix it it's a pork this eliminates the need for mixing in a separate Bowl I usually just plop the flour in here from my flour container today I had a bowl extra bowl because I wanted to show you all the ingredients but this is all you need to do whenever you make cookies now I'm gonna blend this real good okay this is a very stiff dough so it should look like this when you're done blending it and my spatula and get it into one ball that way your dough doesn't dry out now if your dough is turns out dry because if you think it's a flower that you have or whatever then you'll just add a little bit of water if you need to I didn't need to but just in case just add a little water to make it so little form of all you'll want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and they're gonna bake about between 12 and 15 minutes so first I'm going to roll them into balls and then roll them in sugar you just want to grab about this much because you're gonna make it I'm about an inch or inch and a half wide I like ours a little bigger so I just roll them and then throw them again just a little in the sugar and play some two inches apart a little roll them a little dip them in the sugar and two inches apart if you don't feel like rolling now then you could just take a glob just press your finger in it and dip them in the sugar and there you go also I did grease the pan IOL dit with canola cooking spray I mean two sheets of cookie sheets full and I have this much left over I can make a third sheet so all together it'll make three sheets if I doubled the recipe and what I like to do is I like to form this into a roll and freeze it you just want to form this into a roll or it into a log and then I just roll it up and place it in a freezer Bay or you can double up on just regular babies if you love now after you take this out of your freezer and while it's still buying you can slice it up into like half-inch slices and then you can dip those in sugar and place them on your cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes and this is what they turn out to look like the cookies are done they're still warm and they smell delicious there's already some missing not from me from one of my phones so that's good they they really enjoy these cookies so I hope this has helped you thanks for watching [Music]", "E8y6HQA23TY": "and we're back in the kitchen for another cookie so the first ones I'm going to start with are the molasses chili molasses cookies now these are like rolled into balls and then rolled into granulated sugar placed on a cooking tray and then they'll actually come out and they're nice and chewy we have two and a quarter cups of flour we have one tablespoon of baking soda which I've already pre-measured and those are basically the dry ingredients besides your spices now for spices we have a couple teaspoons of ginger a teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg which will also go into the dry ingredients this will also require one and probably one and a half sorry three quarters of a cup of butter now for those who don't know basically sticks of butter come in a half cup so by having a half of a half you actually have 3/4 of a cup and this is softened so it's ready to be used we're gonna need a egg and then a quarter of a cup of molasses now molasses is a little bit slower to come out but this one's not too too bad and this will give the cookies our nice deep rich color to that we're gonna add in here a 1 cup packed brown sugar and it is so packed and then the molasses is gonna go in here and again that was a quarter of a cup and then we're gonna just go ahead and add the butters preemies all together really well now again this is a recipe that would normally call for salt but because I use salted butter I go ahead and I omit the salt from my recipe now then molasses will make this a little stickier and with the butter so you go ahead and make sure you scrape off the sides really well so everything is mixed good make sure that I'm gonna add one egg just in case you didn't know either usually one egg it's like a quarter of a cup and again I'm gonna just scrape the bowl again before I go ahead and add the dry ingredients just to make sure that everything is going to be incorporated well well what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move them to a different pool and allow them to chill and again we're gonna make these into quarter sized balls and then roll those in granulated sugar the dough is just really too soft right now to handle he or she takes I'd say 30 minutes to an hour for them to chill off especially with it being so cold outside right now I think we woke up this morning and had two degrees so it's definitely wintertime all right so I put a ceramic on this put it out to chill and because we're in video world we can actually fast-forward and get onto the rolling of the balls in just a few minutes in your world and it'll be about an hour of mine see that okay we're back with our molasses cookies they have chill for about two hours and you'll see that the dough is quite firm and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna make one and a half inch balls so roughly the size of like a walnut a recorder to that we're going to roll these in a granulated sugar and that's basically I just have it in a paper plate and then we're gonna put them about two inches apart on a cookie sheet yield I would say is normally about 60 cookies again it depends on the size of the cookies you make if you're a little bit more generous with your balls and then it'll be pure cookies and if you're a little smaller of course and you're gonna have a little bit more okay this tray is ready to go in these will cook for about 12 to 15 minutes and a 350 degree preheated oven okay so after they sit a minute or two on the tray it's time take them off and let them cool on a cooling rack they smell super gingery and then coupled with the molasses makes for a nice chewy cookie okay so there we have our chewy molasses cookies they definitely smell very gingery so if you like ginger and you like the molasses combination this is kind of like a quick easy way of doing it besides a little bit of a refrigerator time and we hope you enjoy them and let us know if you try them out and happy baking [Music] you", "d1s_5kh9RXY": "hi I'm Stephanie George gave joy baking calm today we're going to make gingersnap cookies and this is what they look like as you can see they have really nice crisp edges and soft and chewy centers and they're really nice and spicy so the if you want to make the batter if you have a stand mixer like I have here you use your paddle attachment or you could just use a hand mixer for this and the first thing we need is three-quarters of a cup which is a hundred and seventy grams of butter and have that at room temperature I like to use unsalted I prefer the flavor but you could use salted if that's what you like and then I'm just going to beat this for maybe a minute just to get it nice and smooth okay and as always when you're making a batter just scrape down this bottom in the sides of your bowl as much as you need to because you want to make sure that all the ingredients are mixed together so next we're going to add a half a cup a hundred grams of granulated white sugar and then a half a cup of firmly packed dark brown sugar that's about a hundred and five grams and then I'm also going to add just a half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract so I'm going to beat this on medium medium-high speed just until everything's mixed together and it's kind of light and fluffy maybe two minutes okay this is what you're looking for this nice light and fluffy everything all mixed together so next we're going to add one large egg and have that at room temperature along with a quarter of a cup about 80 grams of molasses and what I do is you can either lightly butter your measuring cup or spray it with one of those nonstick sprays before you put them alas this in and then it comes out a lot easier it doesn't stick as much just a little tip there the same thing with like honey if you do that makes it a lot easier okay so I'm just going to beat that in okay looks good gonna smell you really smell that molasses just love that smell okay so now for our dry ingredients in a separate bowl I have two cups that's 260 grams of all-purpose flour you may know that is plain flour to that I'm going to add a half a teaspoon of salt now if you use salted butter you might want to eliminate that salt or just cut it back a bit and then I'm going to add half a teaspoon of baking soda and then for our spices I have one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon that's about three grams and two teaspoons about four grams of ground ginger and a half a teaspoon it's but one gram of ground cloves this will give us that real nice spicy flavour now if you wanted to add even more ginger flavor you could add a bit of that crystallized ginger ginger and chop that up and define pieces or you could even add like a tablespoon of finely grated fresh ginger if you really want to have a pronounced ginger flavor okay so now all you have to do is add our flour mixture and start your mixer on low because you don't want that coming up in your face and then just eat it until everything's all mixed together okay that looks good such a pretty color that ginger color makes sense ginger snaps okay so now this this batter is a little I'm just going to fold in that flour that's up the sides but this batter is still a little soft and we're going to roll it into little balls to make our cookies so I'm going to chill it you know till it's firmed up a bit you know maybe have depending on how soft your batter is you know could take a half an hour an hour I mean you could even make it well ahead do this tomorrow if you want but just until it's firm enough that you can roll it easily into individual balls so putting the bowl cover it with plastic wrap and we're going to chill it when we come back we will roll our make our cookies and bake them off so our batter is nice and chilled so first pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and you will need a baking sheet I've lined my baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper but you could just lightly butter it or spray it with one of those nonstick spray so now we want to form our batter into one-inch that's two point five centimeter round balls now I if you have a scale at home this is the fastest way I'm going to show you to get all of them the same size so just take a bit and then roll it into a steer first one and then if you have a ruler just check okay it's a boat let's go an inch and then just weigh that and that's about 19 20 grams so that way you can just take your little thing and just keep weighing it and so that that's how I find is the best way to do it so once you roll all them into I put 12 on a baking sheet like this into your L then have just put about a half a cup of granulated white sugar but a hundred grams into a small bowl and then just roll your cookie balls in the sugar like so nice and coated and then put on your baking sheet space them about two inches apart because they do spread about five centimeters and then just take a little glass of some type and then just gently press them down just to flatten them a bit if you want you can add a little more sugar to the tops like so and so what we do so once you've done that then we're going to bake them now gingersnaps really is a personal thing how weather how crisp you want them to D to be in my family we like the outsides the edges to be a little crisp but we like the center's soft and chewy so I find that as about twelve minutes so okay or gingersnaps are now done you can see they flattened and they've spread out there's some cracking and for like I said for crisp edges but the soft and chewy Center if you feel you can feel the edges are set firm but yet the center when you press is still a little soft so I'm going to let these cool and when we come back we will try one okay so now try one that's really tasty I love the texture like I said the outside is crispy the edges and yet inside is really nice and soft and chewy and of course with all those spices and the molasses you have a really flavorful cookie I mean my kids just love them so you can store these probably I find five to seven days but they never last that long but they you can so enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "NuCNFoi-KLQ": "hi this is Emmy at Halawa calm and we're getting ready to make ginger molasses cookies that are bite-sized the first step is we're going to preheat the oven to 350 degrees next up is any to soften the butter so what I do is right stick it in a bowl and I heat it up for three seconds so my next step I'm gonna start putting the dry ingredients together starting with four cups of flour next we add three teaspoons of baking soda one teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of ginger two teaspoons of cinnamon and that's all your dry ingredients that you whisk together and with it's all combined next we're going to cream together with butter and the sugars now I mix those all together here in the stand mixer until light and fluffy maybe two minutes or so to measure my molasses my tip is if you spray your measuring cup with the cooking spray it helps it slide right out when you dump it a new mixture so then you're not sitting there forever trying to scrape it out then we mix all these wet ingredients until well combined now I'm gonna scrape down the sides make sure it's all getting mixed together next up we have the drying to the web slowly one cup at a time so now those nice and ready and we can line our sheets picking the sheets roll it in the sugar and get it in the end so now I'm gonna roll them this is how I do it take a tablespoon measure and get a heaping tablespoon I'm gonna squish it in there and take off any excess get it out and I just gently roll this real quick and I cut it in half this is what makes them bite-sized so then we roll this into a ball and we roll it in the sugar get it all nice and coated stick it on the baking sheet okay first batches roll so we're ready to stick them in the end while those are in the oven I'm gonna go ahead and roll the next batch well there you have it you end up with about 100 or so cookies ish depending on how many you taste tested and enjoy", "juM2GPNpBBc": "hey thanks for checking out fix my recipe.com i'm chef billy parisi double chain double apron going on today our new fix goes to pet of Maryville Tennessee she

"nSjYzX1giRY": "today I'm going to be making something a really really fun that I love during the holidays and these are my gingerbread cookies so here are the ingredients that we need one and a half cups of all-purpose flour 1/4 cup of unsalted butter and I have melted my butter 1/2 a cup of brown sugar 1/4 cup of fancy molasses one egg one-and-a-half teaspoons of ground ginger 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon of salt now if you are using salted butter simply omit the salt in my recipe so those are the ingredients so let's get started so in a large bowl I'm going to get in all of my butter and then my molasses and I've just heated the molasses up a little bit in the microwave just so that it flows a little bit better so I can get it out of my vessel here a little bit quicker ok that's good and then all of my brown sugar and I'll just take a fork and just break that down a little bit to help out my mixer ok that's good I'll grab my mixer we're just going to start mixing this together once you've got that mixed up add your egg in that's just gonna loosen this whole mixture right up and this already smells really really good so once that is nicely mixed then we can start adding in our dry ingredients so we'll start adding in all of our dry ingredients and I'm gonna sift them in today so that's our flour our baking soda baking powder our salt our cinnamon and a ginger but I'm just gonna start sifting all of this in oh it smells really good and there we go perfect grab my mixer start mixing this up so you want to just mix this until well combined so that's it that's nicely mixed and that is it for the recipe so now what we want to do is we want to gather this up into a ball we're gonna make a disc and then we're gonna chill this down in the fridge and get it all out huh that's such a great dough okay that's good just like that and then I'm just going to form a rough disc just try to keep it round close it up so you want to flatten it down and try to get it as even as possible and this is just gonna make it a lot easier later on after its chilled when we roll it out so at this point our lovely dough is ready to be chilled down in the fridge all right so my dough has been chilling for about an hour and a half or so Oh beautiful dough will get a little bit of flour down get her go out a little bit of flour on a rolling pin and now I'm just gonna roll this out look at that beautiful dough something that I do like to use is an offset spatula it just helps me get right underneath the dough and make sure that it's not sticking to my work surface so you can just slide it right underneath just like that if you find that your dough is cracking that means it is too cold so just let it sit out a little while longer before rolling it I would say that's about the quarter-inch thick so I've got a set of three gingerbread cutters that I'm going to be using today these are really really cute so we'll just get her cut out where's our first one and I do have a tray here on the side with a silicone liner and I'll show that to you in a second I'm just gonna get my first one down here and I'll move everything over so that you can see then we'll get another one cut I'll switch over to a smaller spatula just so I have a little bit more control when I'm removing these and we'll get him on so really really cute I'm gonna do another one so a little while later and Here I am back again I baked both of my trays for a total of 15 minutes each at 350 degrees Fahrenheit so our recipe today made a total of 24 cookies so at this point you're gonna let your cookies completely cool and then you want to store them in an airtight container we'll just break into one and I'll just show you how nice these are look at that oh and they smell really really good I have some royal icing in my Wilton disposable bag and if you want to see a recipe for this I'll put a link to it in the description box below my video in our last one and I'm using a size 3 tip in case you're wondering in this fancy thing that I'm using this coupler right here is made also by Wilton and this is called the Wilton twist and I do have an unboxing and little mini review of this little product which retails for about $4 very very amazing and there we have a our cute little gingerbread man so I'll just show you quickly how well this little product works grab the purple portion here and just give it a half twist lift it up remove your nozzle your piping tip grab another one pop it on slide it down half a twist boom bada bing done and you're ready to go that is how amazing that little product is I do have a little unboxing on my channel as well I'll put a link to that in my video underneath the in the description box I'll put the other one back on and there we go so we've come to the end of another video I hope you enjoyed it I had a lot of fun making it if you enjoyed my video please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I do appreciate that so that's it for today and I'll see you next time you", "mWYETP_SEGY": "good morning youtube this is the attempted homemaker and today i'm going to make old-fashioned soft and chewy molasses cookies i found this recipe in a video on the glen and cookings glen and friends cooking channel i will leave a link down below to the video and glenn from glen and friends cooking found this recipe in a book called the wilkins family home cooking album which was published in 1935. glenn and friends cooking is pretty awesome if you want to see some old-fashioned recipes or easy recipes he pulls stuff out of all sorts of old cookbooks it's very interesting lots of fun to watch and a lot of the recipes are quite simple and easy to do okay so for this recipe i am going to need or actually the recipe calls for a half cup of shortening i don't have any shortening so i'm using unsalted butter i'm going to need a half cup of sugar 1 egg three quarters of a cup of molasses a quarter cup of milk one or two and three quarters cup of all-purpose flour two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of baking soda three quarters of a teaspoon of ground cinnamon a quarter teaspoon of ground ginger and half a teaspoon of salt at the end of glenn's video they do a taste test and both him and his wife mentioned that they would both put more cinnamon and ginger the cookies came out fine they said they tasted delicious but to their own personal preference they like a stronger flavor i'm going to stick with the amounts in the recipe for now and decide later step one is going to be cream the butter and the sugar okay butter and sugar is all creamed do yourself a favor if you're making these and make sure the butter is softened to room temperature by leaving it out for maybe a couple of hours before you start i did not do that and it took a lot longer to get it to this point it probably should be creamed a little bit more but this is going to be good enough okay so our next step is adding in one beaten egg three quarters of a cup of molasses and a quarter cup of milk so let's do that egg [Music] here's the molasses a quarter cup of milk i'm gonna mix that all up together and come right back okay so that's all mixed together this is what happens when your butter isn't properly warmed up or brought to room temperature it gets all chunky but that's okay i will still make get through this i'll know better for next time and our next step is to sift together all the dry ingredients i don't have a sifter i'm just going to use a whisk to mix them together okay we need two and three quarter cups of flour half a teaspoon of baking soda three quarters of a teaspoon of ground cinnamon one quarter teaspoon ground ginger and half a teaspoon of salt that's all the dry ingredients together all i'm going to do is take the whisk and mix them up like that so they're evenly distributed okay now that i've got the dry ingredients all mixed together i'm going to dump them in with the wet ingredients at this point i'm also going to turn the oven on to 350 degrees fahrenheit try to not spill them all over the place did make a little bit of a mess and whatever all right turn on the mixer and i'll be back in a minute okay just a real quick tip if you have a stand mixer that has one of these openings on it i learned this the hard way after making a mess one day i take a towel and just put it over the opening when i turn the mixer on that way the flower doesn't all just fly out the top there and make a great big mess all right all mixed up this is what it looks like it's very very thick very very sticky the next step is to spoon it out onto a cookie sheet all right oven's about warmed up everything's mixed together i've got a greased cookie sheet here and a greased cookie scoop don't have to use a cookie scoop but i find it makes it a lot easier so we are going to drop that's about what you want in there it's going to be about the size of the cookies i'm going to go ahead and fill this sheet up it also says to flatten them with the back of a spoon so i'll do that and show you the result before i put them in the oven i just want to show you how you flatten these cookies in case you've never done it just grease the back of a spoon use cooking spray kirkland canola oil cooking spray and just press down a little bit and then scoop up press down a little bit and scoop up and i found that the um the cookies started to stick to the spoon after about the fifth or six cookies so i just wiped the spoon off sprayed it again and now i'm going to put them into the oven for about 12 minutes sorry i had my button there cut myself off so this is the first batch it's going to go in the oven for about 12 minutes and then i have this much left so i think i'm going to get at least one more batch in there maybe two and i'll be back in 12 minutes to show you the results and here we are 12 minutes later with the first batch out of the oven i've got another batch about the same size in there now and then the smaller cookie sheet to go in after i'm gonna let them cool and then do a taste test and let you know how good they are alrighty cookies have cooled down enough to eat so here we go the bottom is not burnt nice and thin hmm so glenn and friends was right and i would definitely add more cinnamon and ginger for a stronger flavor they're nice and soft and the outside is crispy this would be great with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee", "GUxIYRghg8A": "[Music] hello welcome to fort

"hello and welcome to the mustache manatee kitchen today we are going to be making ginger molasses cookies and first thing i'm going to do is go over the ingredients we're going to be using okay so we have our 12 ounces of room temperature unsalted butter we have one cup of white granulated sugar along with one cup of packed light brown sugar we have our baking soda which is four teaspoons we have two teaspoons of cinnamon we have one teaspoon of ground cloves and we have one tablespoon of ground ginger up here we have a half cup of molasses we have two eggs and we have our 540g grams of all-purpose flour and one teaspoon of salt added that is what we are going to need to make our beautiful cookies okay so for step one we're going to combine our dry ingredients so we're going to take our ginger our baking soda our cinnamon and the cloves pour them all in there with the flour we're going to whisk that up really well like so and then we are going to sift it this of course gets out any little lumps that you might have in your flour or anything else and it's just going to help it mix better if you're not sifting your dry ingredients honestly i don't know what you're doing with your life and now we sift yes i don't know why but i always find something to be very satisfying it's very aesthetically pleasing to me to watch it all it's shaken down to a much smaller finer powder go sifted whisk it up a little bit more just for good measure dry ingredients ready to go okay for our next step we're going to cream the butter and sugars together this is another reason why it's important to have your butter at room temperature and split up into smaller pieces like this as opposed to just you know throwing in the whole block of butter this will help it cream faster more evenly we got our sugars and then we're going to want to go in a nice medium speed lift this up we're going to go in about four to start on the kitchenaid mixer or whatever mixer you use and what we're looking for here is we're looking for a light and fluffy uh consistency from where the butter and the sugar combine okay so at this point we're getting close to being done with the creaming process but what i want to do here is stop halfway through to remind you to scrape your bowl get in there scrape all the butter and sugar around make sure you're not missing anything make sure you really get into the bottom of the bowl there's that little that little nub down there yeah get that guy scrape off the paddle and of course you know you can take off all this stuff too really thorough if you'd like to but just a nice scraping here's a little trick i like for not wasting any product scrape it on the edge scoop it off tap it back in up we go the creaming continues okay once you're done with your creamy you should have a nice light uh in texture kind of butter sugar mixture somewhat like this okay so next step with your mixer on about a speed three we're gonna add our eggs one egg at a time so first thing here we go and we're gonna let that go until the mixture and the egg get fully incorporated it doesn't take very long all right egg number two and as soon as this gets incorporated there we are you know what the next stage is we're going to take this down and we're going to scrape our bowl again take it down there make sure you're getting down into that little nub in the middle of the bowl get the paddle all that loose stuff that's hanging out [Music] okay so now on speed let's say speed two we're going to start to slowly add the molasses you're just going to want to scream it in against the side [Music] don't let the paddle get it too much because if the paddle gets it too much it's going to carry it all over the place and make a big mess you're just going to stream it down the side that's most of it so now what i'm going to do here is i'm going to stop bring it down molasses is very sticky and difficult to work with so we're going to use our handy dandy tool here and we're going to get as much of the rest of this out of here as we can and into the bowl there we are okay and you're not going to get all of it but you know you get as much as you can then i'm going to take this off and i'm going to get the sides a little bit and scrape those down along with the paddle here so i'm telling you no matter what you do this stuff's going to get stuck to the side so you get in there let's really mix it up this bad boy back on here all right and this is what we're after now that the eggs and molasses are all combined we have this beautiful ginger molasses cookie mixture i'm telling you guys right now it smells really good all right time to add our dry ingredients next okay now we're ready to add our dry ingredients which is our flour our leavening and our spice mixture so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take oh probably about half of what's in here just a little bit easier on myself you're going to take about half of this mixture and you're going to add it into the bowl you're only going to want to go on like a speed one okay because what you're going to do is you're going to let the flower combine with the mixture a little bit if you crank this up all the flour is going to go and it's going to be hilarious but it's going to make a horrible mess and let's face it you're going to have to clean that up so you don't want to do that once it starts to combine a little bit you crank it up to two and then for three and go just until it's combined just until combined right so then you're going to take it off and guess what we're going to do that's right we're going to scrape the bowl first we're going to get the stuff off the paddle which in case you haven't noticed because i haven't been clear you should be using a paddle attachment for something like this not a uh a whisk or heaven forbid a dough hook why you would use a dough hook i don't know but yeah you know all right so you're gonna scrape down the sides make sure all the loose flour gets incorporated so there'll be loose flour all around just until it's incorporated so it looks like a slightly drier version of the mixture i showed you before there we are all right all right and then since we already have the bowl out we're going to go ahead and we're going to add the rest of our dry ingredients on top of there there we are this guy back on reattach our paddle and pull up speed one again let the rest of the flour and the dry ingredients incorporate into the mixture before cranking the mixture back up or again big mess there we go looks good let's prank those two three excellent that's it that's as long as it should take you're gonna take this back down seriously you guys these cookies they smell so good and i know these are traditionally fall flavors right like this is a cookie you would normally see in november like around thanksgiving or christmas time but you know what we're grown-ups and we make the cookies we want to make when we want to make them yes we do okay so scrape that take our tool scrape the bowl one more time just get some of the rest of that loose flour make sure you're checking the bottom of the bowl that's where the loose flour likes to hide it doesn't want to play nice with the rest of the flower and incorporate so you just have to force the issue a little bit okay and in just a moment i'm going to show you guys what this dough is supposed to look like once everything is incorporated okay and here is your finished ginger molasses cookie dough yes quite nice now because of the molasses this dough can be rather tricky to work with so it needs to hang out in the fridge for approximately two hours before you scoop and bake it off so you're gonna take a bit of cling wrap here and you're going to put this on your product and don't just lay it over the top of the bowl so that all that air is between what i recommend doing is actually putting the plastic up against the cookie dough itself this will help keep it nice and fresh and also help keep things from getting into it there we go sort of like that and then we're going to go into the fridge with it for a few hours and take a brief intermission before we bake okay so now we are out of the refrigerator with our chilled dough and we have some white granulated sugar here that we're going to roll our cookies in so we're going to want to go for about an ounce and a half on the scale here it's a little bit too much okay so we get our ounce and a half we're going to roll into a ball and then we're going to roll in the sugar until it's covered and it looks something like this right take it we're going to put it on our sheet pan and i'll show you what that finished sheet pan looks like okay so here we have our finished tray uh we're going to do eight cookies per tray evenly spaced out three on the top three on the bottom two kind of in the middle here and they're gonna go into the oven at 350 degrees for eight to ten minutes we're gonna rotate them in four minutes we're gonna check them at eight uh they might need to be in uh for the last two depends on what they look like what we're going to be looking for uh is a slight cracking on the top of the cookie to indicate that they are done and of course i'll show you guys what that looks like and now we rotate halfway there okay these are looking and smelling just about done so i want to show you what you're looking for here you can see the tops of the cookies are just starting to crack it's a good indication that they're done so we're going to set them over here and we're going to let them cool on the tray for approximately five ish minutes and then we're going to move them over to a wire cooling rack and i'll show you what that finished product looks like after it's had a chance to chill and spread a little bit okay so now we have our finished ginger molasses cookies here we are this is what the finished product looks like and uh the thing about these cookies one of the reasons why we were delicate with them in terms of letting them sit on the tray before we transferred them over to the wire rack one of the reasons why it's important to chill the dough for as long as we did i know that part's tempting to skip right you want to chill the dough for like 30 minutes and then start scooping it's really important to go for a long time because there is a lot of butter and molasses in this recipe and as a result your cookies are really going to want to spread like crazy when they're baking so chilling the dough for as long as i did and making sure that it was chilled all the way through and easy to work with in that way ensures that the cookie keeps its nice uniform size and doesn't turn into a spready buttery mess let's try it that'll work enjoy the cookies", "fVuC7gwbanc": "hey everyone this is Angela from baking with love and today we're making my grandma's recipe for the OMA molasses raisin cookies one of my favorites from childhood it comes from a time in World War two when sugar was rationed so if you didn't know that that's why the molasses is used to kind of offset the amount of sugar needed so we're gonna start out with kind of your core cookie ingredients we've got some butter here it's already about temperature some eggs that are beaten make sure that your eggs are at room temperature this is gonna move us along a lot faster if your eggs are cold put them in a glass of warm water and they'll come up to room temperature pretty quickly so those two it really the only specifics because my molasses is always at room temperature and so other than that flour sugar we're gonna use some raisins and oats I like old-fashioned oats I know the quick oats um times they're people's favorite and cookies but for lack of a better word I like the OE flavor in regular Oh old-fashioned not still cut in this case still cuts for certain things not this batch of cookies so and then some cinnamon and your baking soda and baking powder and salt and we already tell we're gonna get going with this I'm gonna start out with the first things first is cleaning my butter together because I like everything to be a little method so I'm gonna start with all my wet ingredients my butter is not super cool because it is winter here in Minnesota which means that unless I turn up the heat really really high my butter doesn't get super soft so I'm just gonna break it up a little bit rather than breaking out of my stand mixer I like to do but you just going to get it smearing a little bit and then start creaming in each others so my sugar my butter and sugar are creamed together pretty well I'm kind of clumpy but it's not gonna matter in the end we're gonna add the rest of the wet ingredients we're just gonna be our beaten eggs and a molasses let's go take a second I'm usually when I'm doing all of my wet ingredients first in a bowl a normal method like this I also like to add my salt baking South baking powder baking soda here all of these so when I combine all of my wet ingredients all of those are well distributed throughout my base before I add any dry ingredients get all of that in there including your cinnamon which cinnamon molasses are just made to go together okay next thing we're going to add is our flour and that here not a ton of it because we'll be adding quite a bit of oats let's gently stir that in so it doesn't end up all over the place if you're doing a stand mixer version of this start out low and you add your flour we all are not the hard way huh definitely drop cookies they won't be refrigerated her chill at all we're just gonna go straight to women on our coats and you can go ahead and add your raisins at the same time mix those in and we will be ready to drop these onto our baking sheets okay no cookie dough is all mixed up and these are simple drop cookies so I'm just going to use my kitchen teaspoon here tablespoon and roll them up into a balls of the dough not perfect and it's definitely sticky you can place them a couple inches apart so they don't run together and then if you're not sure if your cookie is going to spread too much you can always put two or three on your baking sheet and do a test batch first oven is preheated to 350 degrees so it's ready for these to go right in and I always check my cookies early but these typically bake in about 12 minutes so it should be just about perfect at that point all right somebody to go in the oven again 350 degrees we're gonna bake these for at least 12 minutes you can check on them a bit earlier and they can't take them you know a little bit longer than twelve call to 15 minutes all right let's get a baking okay so our cookies are down there oatmeal molasses raisin sometimes known as World War two cookies because like I said the rationing way back when on the days of our grandparents great-great grandparents my grandma this is a recipe that I latched on of hers when I was little and I've been addicted to it ever since I'm sure you will be too don't forget the cinnamon it just sets off the molasses flavor in these just right so I hope you enjoy them if you do be sure and leave a comment let us know when you make them give the video a big thumbs up be sure to subscribe and come back and see us again thanks you", "ysjxg2MYMTA": "there's nothing that'll get your family excited like a fresh batch of cookies right out of the oven today for our 4-h fund with foods recipe will be making old-fashioned soft molasses cookies this recipe was prepared by our sixth graders in mrs. Ford's class for a lesson on the Revolutionary War and learning about the molasses act so we kind of tied together literacy and cooking nothing better to me alright this video is brought to you by Virginia Cooperative Extension i'm bonnie Tillotson the 4-h agent pragmatics let's get cooking alright for our recipe the first thing we have is two cups of all-purpose flour so we're going to go ahead and put that in our Bowl now you want to make sure when you measure you want it even across the top okay so you don't want it lumped up like that you can take a knife flat edge of the knife and just go straight across and that way it's good and even pour that in our Bowl so we got our two cups our next is 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt now to make 3/4 of a teaspoon I think we've discussed this before you can take what a quarter and a half quarter and a half together we'll make 3/4 so we've got to use our math when we do our cooking so there's the quarter and there's our 1/2 all right then we've got baking soda which is one teaspoon of baking soda and we'll get that in here and again the teaspoon measurement is right here remember the bigger one is a tablespoon we don't want to use that so when you measure out again you can use the flat side of the box to go ahead and measure out evenly just like that all right then we have a teaspoon of ginger get that in there we got a quarter teaspoon of cloves again that really small one close can be very strong so you don't want to use a whole lot of those and then we have a teaspoon of cinnamon so again you can use the flat edge to make sure you have a nice even amount in your spoon just like that [Applause] all right so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna mix up the dry ingredients to make sure everything is even evenly distributed and mixed up well I just use a fork to mix up you don't have to have anything fancy all right now one of the other dry ingredients is sugar we'll go ahead and put that in there now you also want another quarter cup of sugar set aside to roll your cookies in and I've got that right here in that dish so we've got everything mixed together now what we're gonna do is we're going to add the MOL molasses the shortening and the egg and go ahead and get those all mixed together so we'll do that right now now I've cut in the shortening it's going to have kind of a crummy texture almost like cornflakes when you work that in there with the back of your fork next is our molasses I have sorghum molasses not blackstrap the sorghum molasses came from a fundraiser for Mount comfort and it's wonderful flavor to it so if you can help out a local organization please do so we want to make sure we get every drop of this alright and then lastly is our egg and you'll notice the color of that that's one of our eggs which we've got a wide variety of colors due to the different breeds of our chickens so we'll go ahead and get that all mixed up together now once it is mixed thoroughly and you're gonna go ahead and shape the dough into balls and then you're gonna roll them in the sugar before you place them on the cookie sheet which has parchment on it you're going to go ahead and cook those in a 350 degree oven for about 13 to 15 minutes so let's go ahead and get this mixed up well alright we once our dough is all mixed up you'll see right there we're gonna go ahead and form it into some balls the size of it's going to depend on how big of a cookie you want about like that you're gonna put it in the sugar right here coat it in the sugar and then just place it right on the cookie sheet on the parchment paper so we'll do that and then they'll be ready to put in the oven all right tray is full of the rounded cookies to go in the oven we'll put them in there for about 13 to 15 minutes you want them a golden brown and then we'll take a look once they're finished alright our first batch just came out of the oven and boy do they smell good right here rose nicely now what you want to do is take a cooling rack and your spatula carefully get them off the pan put them on the cooling rack just like so and then once they've cooled just a little bit they'll be ready for the family to enjoy again this video was brought to you by Virginia Cooperative Extension enjoy cooking this with your family again I'm Bonnie Tillotson 4-h agent frapp Maddox and until next week for us to meet again with a new recipe for our 4-h fun with foods", "T2oKpARcxMI": "greetings YouTube friends its Joyce from Morris patch of heaven homestead and today we are in the kitchen making molasses cookies okay guys we are going to make molasses cookies it's raining outside and we love to bake when it's raining and our one of our family's favorite cookies is the molasses cookies it makes the whole house smell like fall with all these yummy spices in it so you are in for a treat because as far as I'm concerned these are the best molasses cookies they are chewy and gooey we use blackstrap molasses some use a lighter molasses but we absolutely love the Blackstrap it makes them so dark almost kind of like the Amish makes them the first time we ever saw them was at one of the Amish markets and I realize that they use the blackstrap molasses versus regular molasses so that's what I've been using ever since and it is amazing okay we're gonna get started it's calls for a cup of brown sugar it's half brown and half cane crystals because I ran out so I'm gonna improvise and I done that before and it's fine and then 3/4 cup of shortening this particular recipe asked for coconut oil which you end up not tasting you know some people are like oh no you end up tasting like coconut it does not liquid it's getting a little bit chilly right here in the Midwest and actually it's starting to feel like hull we weren't quite ready for it yet but it's here I think on Friday we are going to get our first frost not looking forward to that because it looks like we need to get out in the garden and get those sweet potatoes and pull the rest of the okra and the tomatoes okay so 3/4 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup of molasses and the way I do my molasses you probably laugh but I pour and then I just pour over like that I love molasses so I always poor man then what it asks for molasses is so so good for you guys I'm gonna give you the benefits when I give it to you ok one egg it's a very very simple recipe one you are gonna want to make and one you will probably make forever if you are a molasses fan like we are this is definitely the cookie for you 2 and 1/4 cups of flour we use an organic flour on our homestead non-gmo to two teaspoons of baking soda and now we start with all of our seasonings or I should say spices not seasonings okay you know I think that all of these seasonings just make and I always throw a little bit more than what it calls just how I how I bake I love the spices so I just add extra cinnamon teaspoon of ginger we love it in our eternal drinks that I showed you about it's so so good okay let's see here a half a teaspoon of cloves we try enough our own it's so amazing I buy the whole cloves and I grind them up in a coffee grinder oh my word that way just is fresher because we've gotten where they have not been so fresh but and then I stick all of my spices and seasonings in the freezer I keep them in the freezer because it keeps them fresh okay okay that's it and we are now going to blend that all together [Applause] I'm thinking that my egg was probably really really small I might add another egg sometimes that happens we have some new later [Applause] so our eggs are really tiny so sometimes I need to add well no I think it'll be fine I'll show you what that looks like when it's all blended together just amazing sometimes when the eggs are a little bit smaller I'll add two instead of one you can just play around with it and see what works for you okay so what we're gonna do now this yummy dough is we make balls round balls like so and then we roll them in sugar just like that I'm gonna do that with all of them and then I'm gonna bring you back after they baked and I will show you the finished product but so for the rest of them I'm just gonna go in like this each and every one of them and you won't believe how beautiful they will be and they're all cracked and stuff and just absolutely beautiful so I'm gonna finish these up and I will be back in a minute okay guys I've got one plate ready I wanted to show them to you they come out so beautiful and crinkly you can make them bigger if you prefer we kind of like just a smaller cookie because that's like a perfect cookie for us to eat but yeah you can make them as big as you'd like they are absolutely delicious I already tried one the coconut oil you cannot even taste in you know think about the benefits that you're getting you're getting the coconut oil and you're getting the blackstrap molasses in there which is so so good for you I want to give you some of the benefits I wrote them down because I know like I am I will just forget the benefits so I just wanted to tell you what they're good for it's good for to help with your blood pressure PMS it's good for like anybody who has inflammation my husband likes to put molasses on his oatmeal I don't really like the taste of molasses other than having them in cookies but what better way than to stick them in a cookie and get your benefits that way it's also good for promotes good mood so if you want to be in a good mood have a molasses cookie by all means it balances your blood sugar as well which is amazing to think that molasses can balance your blood sugar but it's loaded with things like protein and iron and manganese and magnesium it's got potassium and b6 in it it is just in calcium and copper it's just amazing what hole is in blackstrap molasses and I'm not saying that that's going to be in every kind of molasses it has to be Blackstrap so the darker the better because this has been run three times what they do is when they're pulling it from it comes from a sugar cane when they pull it from the sugar cane it goes through this process that becomes a syrup and then they do that two other times so that it becomes really dark and almost burnt but that's where the benefits come from is by having them run at three times I don't think they do that with regular of molasses but with the blackstrap molasses guys and it's not expensive either we get ours at our little Mennonite store and I think that this whole thing is maybe three or four dollars and it lasts a really long time so now you can see why I stick so much of it in our cookies to make them darker and you can add more or less to your taste but you know what you really can't taste it they are so delicious I have to tell you a little story when our oldest daughter was you know just young our kids are real entrepreneurs on you know doing some kind of this making money while she was making molasses cookies cookies for our family quite often and people would taste them and they absolutely loved him so she started a little business and was going around our square with little bags of homemade molasses cookies in a basket and selling them people absolutely loved them and she'd stack them up real cute and have a little tie on them and I think she was selling them even back then for maybe you know three dollars a dozen maybe a little bit more I can't remember but yes this is a cookie that is a favorite of our families that we've been doing for many years so I hope you guys will give it a try I will have the recipe down below for you so that you can try it let me know what you think and also start using molasses it's so so good for you good for your health but anyway if you like what you saw tell a friend help grow our channel press that like button and ring the bell so that you'll be notified as to when we do another video and until next time guys god bless you", "_og7HEgGnDk": "hello and welcome back to cupcake Gemma and to some some toyless now if you watched last week's video you will know that Gemma is still off she's in bed resting up hopefully she's going to be back with you guys soon because she really misses you and she really misses baking as well which is really sad because it's what she loves to do so I thought there's got to be something that we can do with Gemma to get you guys back baking together and it's nearly Christmas which is probably the best time of year ever and it's really fun the Baker Christmas and one of the best things to do is make gingerbread men because you can give them as gifts you can hang them on the tree and I thought it would be great if we go into the kitchen we'll whip up a batch of gingerbread men and then we'll pack them up we'll head up to Gemma's house and hopefully Gemma and I can do some decorating together okay so I'm guessing that most of you have probably made gingerbread men in your lifetime but I'm gonna give you my recipe because I think that it is absolutely ace and it all starts with 125 grams of soft unsalted butter and a hundred and 75 grams of light brown sugar you can use dark brown as well it just adds a bit more of a caramel II taste and sometimes it can be a little bit too overpowering I'm gonna put that on the mixer and we're gonna cream it together just for a couple of minutes ok so now we're going to add some wet ingredients and I've got 80 grams of golden syrup if you're in the States or you can't get hold of on syrup corn syrup will also do the job and to that I'm going to add one large egg just mixing that together before puffing it into our mixer and we're going to turn it on and cream it together so once that's nice and smooth and combined sometimes it can take a little while it looks kind of split but keep mixing and it will come together we can add our dry ingredients and I've got 350 grams of plain flour that's gonna go straight into the bowl along with one teaspoon of baking powder just to give it a little bit of lift and a good pinch of salt and then our spices so this is my all-time favorite Christmas spice mix and I've got one rounded teaspoon of both ginger and cinnamon along with a little pinch of nutmeg and cloves or it's gonna turn that onto a low speed and bring it together until it forms one dough okay that is the dough completed so now all we need to do is let this rest for about thirty minutes to an hour in the fridge just to let the gluten relax and also and baking the cookies from a chilled dough is going to help prevent them from spreading so we need to get all of the dough out onto the surface now if you find that your dough is quite sticky at this stage and you're not able to form a nice ball without your hands getting covered just add in a little bit of plain flour and kind of knead it into it until you are able to form a nice ball and then what we're going to do is just wrap it in some cling film and put it in the fridge so I made one earlier so we can get to Gemma's house quicker and get on with the decorating it's been in for about an hour and it's nice and firm ready for us to roll out so I've got my big rolling pin and I'm gonna dust the surface with a little bit of plain flour and a little bit just on top of the dough so that our rolling pin doesn't stick to it and now we can start rolling it out and we're gonna aim for about four millimeters in thickness all right so now we can start cutting out our cookies you can do these whatever shape you want you don't have to do gingerbread men but I'm just putting a bit of flour on the surface and dusting the cutter in it so it doesn't stick to the cookie dough and then we'll chop them out so I'm just putting them onto a baking tray I've got these nice nonstick kind of Silpat thingies here but you just use a bit of greaseproof paper and they're going to spread a little bit but not loads so put a bit of space between each cookie so that they don't stick together so once you've cut all the gingerbread that you can out of that one sheet and then bring all the dough back together and roll it out again [Music] okay so now it's time to bake them so make sure that your oven is preheated to 170 degrees C with a fan and we're going to bake them for 10 minutes until they're nice and golden on top [Music] so those look perfect you can see the outsides just starting to turn nice and brown and golden so we'll let those cool down and we'll whip up with some royal icing we'll make some colors and then we'll pack it up and we'll go see Gemma [Music] so I'm gonna start with 400 grams of icing sugar and so that we're going to add some egg white powder and you can normally get this in supermarkets you can definitely get it in the stores here in the UK but if not you can use fresh egg whites and we're going to use 15 grams of that and then we're going to add some water and I'm going to start with 4 tablespoons of water and it's really going to be a bit stiff but that's fine it's better to add a bit extra than make it too wet to begin with so as you can see the mix is really struggling with this and it's not smooth it's all lumpy so I'm going to add a tiny bit of water at a time until it's nice and smooth [Music] [Applause] and once we've got the right consistency we're just going to leave it whipping for about five minutes just to get it nice and airy it's gonna make it much easier for us to fight with it [Music] so I'm just gonna mix up a few colors before we head over to Gemma's house some Christmassy ones and then a little bit of black and white so we can give some detail to our gingerbread men [Music] so that's my cookies and the ice thing all packed up now I just need to go and get myself ready and we can head off to Gemma's [Music] [Music] we have made it across London if we're in New York we'd say we'd come uptown but unfortunately we are not we're in cold chilly North London hopefully it's nice and cozy in Germany so let's go and see her hopefully she's in let's get inside it's cold come on I mean oh well good because I brought you some fun stuff gingerbread it'll make it man don't need to get it just smell really good sorry hey that's for there full of favorite Christmas by snakes yeah and yeah brought lots of icing as well so that we can have a little decorating so that's more exciting then that's like yes I win we yeah we need to get them in these little baggies let's do it let's do it indeed this one it's great to have a friend yes help you fill your piping bags [Music] do you need a little bit of investor so it's good to have a little bit of extra water just in case it was too stiff and like when we were making it I said it's always easier to add more water like don't make it too runny right we are all piped we are then we're not pipes yet we're piping bags and I'm sure you guys know already but Gemma is the queen of piping that's very kind that's a good sugar master it's necessary I think you're gonna go first I'm Sinkin for you all right wonderful little mind I have also done a very expensive piping masterclass video so please check that out because there's loads of really good tips on how to control your royal icing in a piping bag and just other great tips on shapes and stuff I'm gonna get going this guy he can't see anything he can't

these always take top prize at any cookie exchange party I go to you're just going to love these start with 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend my flour blend already contains ample gum so if yours doesn't just add a half a teaspoon next add 2 teaspoons of baking soda 2 & a half teaspoons of ground ginger 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of ground cloves and finally 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt give all our dry ingredients a good mix till everything's well combined now here's this recipes secret ingredient its crystallized ginger if you can find it just make sure your brand is gluten free crystallized ginger is just really candied ginger and it really does taste amazing and these ginger cookies you'll find when you chop the ginger though it gets quite sticky so there is a secret trick to this for this recipe we're going to need 3/4 cups of finely chopped ginger if you wanted to stop sticking together just sprinkle the specialized ginger with a little bit of gluten-free flour the gluten-free flour sticks to the sticky bit so it doesn't all clump together one big lumps this is starting to look really good let's add this to our dry mixture making sure it's evenly distributed throughout the flour you don't want bits to be all stuck together keep your hands in their feeding tube in a separate bowl add 1/2 a cup of vegetable shortening making sure it's at room temperature and 1/4 cup of unsalted room-temperature butter let's give this a good mix until everything's light and fluffy and well combined then we're going to add one cup of dark brown sugar once the sugar and the butter is combined add one extra-large egg or two small eggs eggs are really important in gluten free cookies that help bind things together once that's nicely mixed we're going to finish with 1/4 cup of molasses preferably light but if you just have the regular that's ok too give it one final good mix and don't do what I'm gonna do right now oops Oh yes folks that's right I have just destroyed my mixer so I'm going to have to finish this the old-fashioned style with a spoon of course if your mixer still working just add your dry ingredients to your wet making sure everything is mixed well together and you're left with a nice thick batter before we can start baking we need to let this set simply cover with cling film you pop it in the refrigerator for at least an hour the butter and the mark will Harden which will result in a very stiff dough so next you want to line a baking tray with parchment paper it sprinkle some sugar on a plate with wet hands roll the dough into about one and a quarter inch ball then simply roll around the sugar until it's completely covered the sugar creates a nice crispy coating on the outside of our cookie which is really yummy so repeat the process 15 times we're ready to bake I sometimes like to squish down the cookie dough with a fork to give it a bit of a pattern but you don't need to do this if you leave them round they'll look just fine bake the cookies at 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius for about 10 minutes now this is very important do not overcook these cookies if anything you need to undercook them take a couple testers if you need to just so you get the timings right you'll know they're done when they just start to crack on top but they're really soft inside you'll be so soft you actually have to let them rest on the cookie sheet for at least a minute before you can remove them with a spatula carefully remove the cookies from the cookie sheet and let cool on a rack you could cook these properly till it be nice soft and squishy on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside one last important note is to keep them stored in an airtight container this will maintain their freshness for longer so there you have it gluten free ginger spice cookies just a type of holiday so if you liked that video and you want to see more and help me get a new Mixmaster please like subscribe and share it with your friends

swear they are soft they're chewy they're so good and they honestly don't taste that sweet you can add more sugar if you guys want to make them sweeter better oh my god they just taste perfect the way they are so this is one of the cookies I have left guys this recipe made 35 cookies okay I am it down to two cookies I have a gingerbread man and a Christmas tree and I made these two days ago okay so I'm down to two cookies they're addicting guys you guys may not thank me because they're addicting but you might think me because they are also so delicious these are honestly so perfect the most perfect cookies ever so now let's get into the video and I hope you guys enjoy it to start off in One Bowl you're going to mix three cups of flour 1 tablespoon of ground ginger 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon 1/4 of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg 1/4 of a teaspoon of ground cloves 1/2 of a teaspoon of baking soda 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking powder and lastly 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and then just whisk all the ingredients together until well combined and set the bowl aside for this next part I'm going to be using my electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment add 10 tablespoons of softened butter to your bowl as well as 3/4 cup of pack 2 dark brown sugar and then just cream the butter and the sugar together until well combined make sure you're occasionally stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl meanwhile separate an egg you're only going to the yellow part or the yolk if you drop the yolk into the cup like I did it's okay just scoop it back up and keep going until you're just left with the yolk and then you want to add that into your mixture and you also want to add in one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract and again just mix until well combined then you're going to measure out half a cup of molasses not the blackstrap kind and you're going to add that into your bowl then you're also going to add in one tablespoon of now mix that together until well combined and make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl now with your mixer set on low speed slow the add in the dry ingredients and mix until well combined you can add additional milk as needed just to bring the dough together I actually needed about four more tablespoons of milk then you're going to place foil or parchment paper onto a cookie sheet I spread out some flour onto the foil as well just so the dough wouldn't stick to it divide the dough into two equal portions and then roll out each portion evenly till 1/4 inch thickness now I didn't have a roller or I couldn't find mine so I just used my hands and that worked just as well once your dough is rolled out you're going to add another piece of foil or parchment paper over it and then you're going to stick it into your freezer for 10 minutes or overnight like I did in the refrigerator you just want the dough to be firm day to the next day you're going to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees take your dough out out of the refrigerator or if you did in the freezer and then you just want to start cutting out your cookie shapes I'm using cookie cutters here once your cookies are cut out put them on a new cookie sheet lined with foil or parchment paper make sure to also put some flour on the other piece of foil and also put some flour on the cookie cutters you can also use a spatula if you're having trouble lifting up the dough from the cookie sheet use the scraps to roll out the dough again and then you're just going to make some more shapes I'm just using gingerbread men and Christmas trees bake your cookies in the oven for six to eight minutes six minutes actually ended up being perfect for my cookies when the cookies are ready they should leave a slight indentation when touched and you could also check them with a toothpick [Music] then you just want to let your cookies cool completely before we start putting icing on them a few inches later for the royal icing you're going to need three cups of confectioner's sugar a 1/4 of a teaspoon of cream of tartar then just mix those two ingredients together until well combined then you're going to add in two egg whites using an electric hand mixer or an electric stand mixer you're going to beat in those two egg whites for about five minutes or until the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape then I fitted my piping bag with a decorating tube and added some royal icing into the back so I could start decorating my cookies I used two little chocolate candies for the buttons but you can also just put in some food coloring into the icing and do it that way I also experimented a little with how I wanted my cookies to look so some of them have bow ties some of them have filled in legs that they're all different for the Christmas trees I added three drops of green food coloring to the icing and then I realized I actually want the color a little darker so I added two more drops and then I put that in a piping bag and then I started piping the icing onto the cookies I also experimented with these a little bit but for the most part they just have like this swirly design on them and some sprinkles I absolutely love how my cookies turned out both in the taste and in how they look and they're honestly so delicious this recipe made 35 cookies for me so I ended up just giving some cookies away I hope you guys enjoyed that video of

will spice in my flour and I will leave the recipe on the box I have it here cinnamon ginger orange vest and gloves and now you put it here on my flour now you put my baking soda and bacon power and a little bit of salt are you mix it now you mix it very well a little bit egg you can do these cookies by hand but in the machine is much quicker and easier my oil and half a cup of molasses I like to grace in my cup before they put molasses or honey but then is very easy to all came out and I don't lose a drop so I you mix a little bit when it is well blowing that I start to put my flour when you put almost all your flour you start to do little by little because you never know how much flour we will need maybe you not used all and maybe you need a little bit more I didn't need all my flower I think I have here a cutter of cop left over but it is okay when you get to this consistence you can start putting a flower inside a dough that you can play with very easily so you'll be careful to not to put too much flour now we will cover it or you can put in a plastic bag and put it in a refrigerator for at least one hour or until next day so just make it easier to work with and very practical so I you put my dough in a ziplock so now you take to the hit ratio for one hour at least and I come back to finish if you don't want to have it is left over flour here you can put all these spice in your wet ingredients so I have a human dough that has been resting at the hip traditional you know for one hour you can leave it at the hip additional aid for 24 hours and now who is that to shape them to bake let's go I will put my dough in that plate you actually make like a little bow and then you shaped like a little egg something like that look and now you put your heel in my cookie sheet to bake I put a little bit of grease and I already have in my oven get wor me on 350 degrees you and I will continue to shape in my little cookies and I come back to show you what is the next step if your dough is too hard you just want work a little bit with your hands that will get soft with the or meteo of your hand and I will continue doing in I come back so did I have all done I you take it to the oven and I come back in few minutes my cookies are done it was 12 minutes at the oven and they crack it and they are beautiful and now you put them in a powdered sugar are you put like a half

cookies favorite recipe of mine this is what we're gonna be making won't you join us [Music] my name is Adam I'm gonna be showing you how to make some delicious molasses cookies today they're a recipe that has been passed on my family for a couple generations and it's a great recipe for holidays or just any time really so let's go ahead and get started shall we so we've got all our ingredients here first thing you want to start off you're gonna want to start off with a cup and a half of melted margarine just about any margarine will do you just want to melt in the microwave get it nice and liquidy just kind of pour it into her mixed hand mixer here okay next thing we want to do is we're going to add two cups of granulated sugar just add that right into the mixer and we just kind of want to get it good and incorporated just mix it turn down low to medium low just start off just get everything get all the butter and the sugar nice and incorporated here we're going to start doing all the wet ingredients first okay once we have that once we have that we're gonna go ahead we're gonna add about 1/2 a cup of molasses now you can use regular molasses or blackstrap molasses either one works good for this recipe here I'm using just regular unsalted molasses very sticky very kind of gooey so you want to be careful with that I find that a plunger mixing cup works very well for this recipe just try to get all the molasses in there okay go ahead and incorporate that again again a medium medium-low and it smells great by the way that's the great thing about this recipe there's a lot of the you get a lot of the kind of a lot of the look very aromatic kind of almost holiday spice type feel to it and then we're going to take two eggs I'm going to add that to our dough as well [Music] again incorporate those as well [Music] once you get all the ingredients well incorporated they're gonna go ahead and start adding the dry ingredients [Music] here's only takes a few seconds to get everything good and mixed okay now for the dry ingredients we've got four and a half four cups of all-purpose flour we have four teaspoons of baking soda we've got one teaspoon of ground cloves two teaspoons of cinnamon and about a half a teaspoon of salt you want to go ahead and just go ahead and just get everything well mixed together you can use an egg beater or if you have a sifter just go ahead and sift everything together get it nice and mixed there and you're gonna want to go ahead and add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients at about three equal portions so we start with about a third of the dry ingredients right there into the batter and we don't want to turn it up too high we just want to get it nice and incorporated you're not really trying to aerate it you're not really trying to get it really mixed very well you just want to get all the ingredients mixed well together [Music] you might need to turn it up a little bit higher just get everything good and mixed okay we've got the first third add another third again start off low otherwise we'll get a big cloud of your dry ingredients exploding in your face [Music] and the dough will start to form he'll start to get sticky and kind of all combined together you get this really really lovely looking brown color from the molasses and we add the last a little bit and again just combined start enough slow till all the dry ingredients start to combine and you just want to mix it just a little bit faster there we go okay so it doesn't really take a whole lot you get like this really really luscious lovely looking brown dough which you're like me and you gotta just got a sample it just a little bit just make sure I'm gonna inscribe perfect wonderful now once you have the dough the molasses makes the dough very very sticky so it's kind of hard to work with so what you need to do is you can't really just go ahead and make this dough and immediately start baking with it you want to chill the dough overnight or for at least three to four hours just to kind of let it become a little less sticky becomes a little less just a little less gooey a lot easier to manage with so just kind of take your bowl off go ahead and you can usually use just the same bowl that you mix the dry ingredients with because the bowl the bowl be nice and floured so nothing will stick to the bowl just kind of get everything work together just kind of transfer it to just a good sized bowl get every laughs a little bit in there okay that works pretty good make a little mess there okay so what you want to do just get a little bit of cling wrap cover this up and put it in your fridge for overnight now you got to be careful with that because the snow is really tasty my family my mom would always have to be very careful about this is that she would have to warn us not to be sneaking little bits of dough she would come through the next day to go get the dough to start making the cookies and she would notice all little handprints in there plus grab and little bits of it cuz little bit tasty bits of frozen dough delicious absolutely wonderful so got to be careful about that avoid the temptation so again we just stick it in the refrigerator for about at least three to four hours or overnight whichever you want so then you'll end up having a nice chilled block of dough right there and you'll be ready to start forming the dough to be big so what you want to do is pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees I've got my oven here set and ready to go so what you want to do is you're gonna start rolling these dough and about a golf ball sized portion of dough you get about that and roll it inch and just plain granulated sugar about a half a cup will do just put it in a bowl I usually just grab just a good size spoon will work the dough will be kind of hard I'm good about like I said about a golf ball size works and you just want to roll it together just kind of forming your hands this is the reason why you want to be nice and cold because the molasses will make things very sticky your hands will get really messy in a very short time and becomes hard to work with so you got to make sure the dough is nice and cold just roll it around just make sure you get a nice coating of sugar on there and just kind of place it on your on your baking sheet I like to use a silicone baking mat for when I'm baking any kind of cookies makes things a lot easier to clean up it bakes very well so this recipe is a lot of fun to have kids help you with because the kids love just kind of getting their hands dirty making the balls roll them and sugar got to make sure they don't lick their fingers in between of course I have that problem sometimes too okay and this recipe itself makes about three dozen cookies so get a good amount of cookies you may want to get a couple different pans of cookies done at a time just because otherwise it can take a while to bake everything together you can while you're waiting for the one batch of cookies to cook you can just go ahead and put the dough back in the freezer if you're worried about it getting warm or getting all soft and messy again but I find that for the most part if you just kind of you can just leave it on the counter it should be fine but some people in my family just some will go ahead and refreeze the dough some will just gonna go ahead and just leave it as it is [Music] and these cookies are great for around the time of Thanksgiving or Christmas the clove and the cinnamon really kind of gives you that evocative feeling of the holidays but you know I find that just about any time any time you want a really good sugar cookie with some with it's a little bit more flavor than just a regular sugar cookie these are great no bake up really moist and chewy in the center from all that molasses and the outside of being nice and crispy it's got a cookie with a great texture okay so we go ahead we have we have our cookies here set and ready to go so we go ahead place it in our oven again at 375 degrees just go ahead and place in the center rack for about 810 minutes you almost kind of want to undercook these cookies just because they will continue to cook on the on the tray once you bring them out and you want them when they come out they'll be slightly rounded in the center with a few cracks running around the top but you want them to kind of go ahead and settle that will give you kind of that soft really chewy Center with a nice crispy edge is what you're looking for so this recipe was actually given to us by a family friend a neighbor who said well if you really want to try a really good cookie recipe I've got one for you it's kind of a little different but you just have some old ingredients molasses and cinnamon and stuff like that and but go ahead and try it I know the first time I had a molasses cookie I couldn't believe how good they taste it I thought there's some I thought there was something special to it and you realize it's a very simple recipe when it comes down to it it's just got a little bit a little bit few different ingredients that people don't really normally use and it's got it just such a great flavorful take on a regular sugar cookie that if you're looking for something just a little bit different try it sometimes it's really really great [Music] a couple of things and making these cookies some people have always asked me why don't you use butter instead of margarine or making these cookies well a couple of reasons what cookie baking margarine is usually better just because it gives you that nice rounded top when it first comes off the margarine it'll keep that nice chewy Center whereas if you use butter the cookies will actually stay rounded they'll have more of kind of a cakey consistency so for a cake your child's type of cookies you do want to use butter but for more kind of flatter chewy your cookies margarine is really good it also give you that nice crispy outside ring which these cookies are very well known for which gives it just that wonderful crunch when you bite into it in the nice chewy soft Center and like I said you before you can use different kinds of molasses whatever kind of molasses your store normally carries you can use either blackstrap molasses or regular unsalted molasses I find the Unseld from molasses is a little bit more milder flavor than the Blackstrap so but if you want that really good molasses flavor go ahead and try the blackstrap molasses with that use the same amount just different varieties now a lot of people when they first encounter these cookies they automatically assume that this is a gingerbread cookie because you have that very spiciness flavor to it but you know they're always very surprised to find out they're actually new and ginger in this is not ginger it's just the cloves the cinnamon and the molasses in there it gives a really spicy kind of holiday kind of flavor to it but like I said it's very tasty and you can use a really anytime I've sometimes also tried just for decorative say trying different colored sugars when I'm rolling the balls in there the problem is the brown color from the molasses it does and really show up very well with like some of the pink or the green or the blue colored colored casting sugars so you can try that for the most part I find it doesn't really help that much just plain old regular granulated sugar works really well they're really nice around the holidays especially you put them under like some twinkling Christmas lights you know by the by the Christmas tree and they're just the the sugar coating of the outside of the cookies it gets that nice twinkle and just kind of nice little added bonus to that now sometimes when you're rolling the balls in the sugar you're gonna notice that you're gonna get a little extra sugar in the dough nothing wrong with that cookie dough has never been hurt by a little bit extra sugar a little extra sweetness in there so don't worry too much about that don't worry if your little balls of dough are not equal in size it's part of the fun of making the cookies is you know you can tell they're handmade they're not coming out of some sort of cookie press or cooking machine you can really tell that these were made by somebody by hand makes them that much more special like I said right around about a golf ball in size it's what you are shooting for too much more the cookies will be too flat and won't keep their consistency too little they won't puff up enough and they won't have that nice chewy chewy Center as you can see sometimes when you're if the dough's been out for a little bit longer they start to get a little stickier and you gotta wash your hands in between these batch a little bit more often [Music] time to check just to see if the cookies are done right now typically takes between 810 minutes what you're looking for it's a nice rounded top starting to notice some cracks forming on the top of it and you're looking for a nice golden brown color around the outside and to me these look just just about perfect so I'm gonna go ahead and bring those out as you can see these ones have a nice rounded top noticing those small little cracks around there the outsides nice and golden brown and when you take them out of the oven what you want to do is you want to go ahead and let them rest do not touch them let them rest on the cookie sheet for about five to eight minutes a piece just kind of let that let them settle is you you might be able to tell it takes a little time you might notice there kind of sinking a little bit the center's are kind of collapsing in on themselves and the outside staying nice and crispy once they are once they've settled for about five to ten minutes and they're okay to transfer them to a cooling rack to let them finish cooling for the rest of until they're nice and cool and room temperature so as you can see these molasses cookies are pretty simple to make but a great holiday tradition a great cookie to have any time you can have messes if you like you can even have them with a glass of your favorite white [Music] you [Music]", "o3TcHJuoT_U": "welcome to Aaron's great American baking show so we'll be learning how to make molasses cookies first let's start by preheating the oven to 30 350 engineer

bitter it smells very bitter like anybody's like allergic to egg in your family just use egg replacer and water but for not just use which is actually two tables duties don't put you table lots and lots of spices like ginger and nutmeg cinnamon and cloves however you don't have all those spices just use pump Isis yeah in a pinch use pumpkin pie spice but not too much of this stuff make sure you get all the ginger out of there still some ginger minute so make sure not to add too much like spices or else maybe your cookies might have a sock ladies that excited but now let's turn it off and then unlock it and it should look like this texture and now we're gonna add the flour in and only mix it on a two on low house blows up Oh [Music] and now let's turn it off then use your hands or scrape or smooth just scrape ah Oh perfect so you don't have much now when you think that you've got enough just scrape your spoon cuz there might be now what we do is let go of it I do that and then make four rows of three this but it's 30 so you can do this part with the parents or our do this part with the parent if you're a kid doing this because this might be tricky for you and it should look like this and now we roll it into a ball like you do this and then after that we have to cut it in a bunch of sugar to make it yummy this or that is what it should look like a little John hole now all we do is we do that to all of them just roll it and times and toys it's fine if you could I love sugar on your hands you can just if you sugar [Music] this is how your hands Mary Mary Mary and you should just do this or just like take a partnership and into okay now we have to do is remember to space because what they're gonna do is they're gonna go like sprite so this is what the finished resemblance would look like from spreading hope you would spark in these parts hark you might be feeling a little bit warm after make sure you ought to touch the pan this fire she just burned herself blue under the bandage hmm and they're nice and fluffy [Music] [Music]", "dfDk0gG1dqE": "hey y'all Janine and you are tuned into living life at the twist the YouTube channel please hit thumbs up like subscribe all that good stuff notifications but in the meantime it's winter time and so to me that means gingerbread and not just any kind of gingerbread really like hardcore spices I love it once my heart wants my belly happy ok so we're gonna be getting to our gingerbread recipe which is vegan and gluten-free but not tastes free and so let's get to it [Music] okay so I have preheated my oven to 350 it's important to have your temperature correct and that is what it calls for this cookie recipe and the first thing I'm actually going to do is take I needed to explain I am doubling the recipe that is below because I'm making a whole bunch of cookies and so what's below like I said it's gonna be the single recipe so let's get on with that right now this is going to be 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds and I have 6 tablespoons of purified water right here and I am going to put these together mix this up a bit just a bit because it's gonna gel and act like an egg like I said this is gluten free and the okay here we are with our dry ingredients this recipe is done with a mixture of almond flour and gluten-free flour blends as I said I'm doubling the recipe so this is going to be 4 cups of almond flour to that I'm going to be adding one whole cup of the gluten-free flour blend just put this as I said we're doing our dry ingredients because we're gonna eventually be adding them to our wet ingredients so I just kind of mixed it's not so important that you cysts or any of that because it's all actually gonna be going in there I mean if you want to get technical and all that but I did want to show you right here is that I actually just got the Walmart brand all-purpose gluten-free baking mix I really like it it always works and so that's what I'm using right now here but just letting you know not every single Walmart carries the actual Walmart brand so that's what I'm using for that ok next I'm going to actually be adding my sugar so this is gonna be 1 cup of sugar now you could use any kind of sugar that you want mine is actually going to be an organic stevia sugar substitute blend the pure organic stevia it's my favorite it tastes wonderful it melts right into any rest he without tasting anything on as stevia can be bitter but this is not so I recommend that that's of course gonna be below everything that we're using is going to be in the recipe and then there's gonna be links to where you can get them whether you need to go to the store or get them online okay next we're going to be doing our spices so we're gonna be starting with cinnamon what I actually did was I took these cinnamon at these organic cinnamon sticks because I was feeling all Martha Stewart like because they hit the clearance and I whizzed them up and actually they've made the most wonderful pungent cinnamon I've ever had in my life and that is what I have right here and so this is going to be two teaspoons of this wonderful cinnamon put that right on top next I'm going to be bringing out my ginger now you could mix some wet jitter fresh ginger ginger I'm actually this is all dry ginger and this is gonna be three teaspoons of it you might think my goodness that's excessive but in this recipe it's perfect to remember this is doubled so that's three teaspoons of ginger okay next I'm going to be putting my nutmeg now I want to show you this right here it's worth it this is actually from my grandmother's kitchen it's worth it to get a nutmeg grater the fresh nutmeg there's just some things like spices that are just worth paying the money for and I just grade it out a bunch until it hit a solid teaspoon because like I said I'm doubling so this is one whole teaspoon about the Nutmeg freshly ground and the spices are more pungent when they're fresh now I'm going to be putting in some cloves you have to be careful a clove so this is only going to be a half a teaspoon of the clove clove is very pungent no matter if it's fresh or not okay and now I just this drying great thing it's just leaving me a couple things to put in which is mm just the baking soda which is gonna help it puff up and so for the baking soda that's gonna be 2 teaspoons followed by just a bit of salt so that's actually you may not think it's a bit but this is the pink Himalayan salt it's gonna be half a teaspoon of salt you really do need that it's gonna set off the sugar it just makes everything come together wonderfully we may say oh my goodness that sounds odd you know salt make the sugar sweeter but that is the truth that's why they have salted caramel products and what not so I'm just giving this you know a nice blend making sure everything or you know whisk here just a bit and I love this Pioneer Woman whisk it conforms to the bowl just getting there and when we come back we're gonna be doing the wet ingredients okay here we are we gonna be doing our wet ingredients I have the old trusty Kitchen Aid out you can use whatever you need to including all the elbow grease if need be but I have the KitchenAid so I'm definitely gonna use it okay so these are my wet ingredients and that's what I'm gonna start what's right now I'm gonna start at the beginning remember we made this gel in the very beginning using our flaxseed in our water so I'm gonna go ahead and put that in there next I'm going to be putting in all of the coconut oil which is going to be softened so you see how it still has that white to it but it's not liquid all the way and so the softer would be one whole cup of this softened coconut oil okay so [Music] is that so one bit all right take this down a notch and I'm going to be putting in my molasses and this is going to be 1/2 of a cup and actually you know what I took off this little thing that we have around here that helps me pour things in but I did it for the camera but honestly it does help having that little kind of protective bib but I'm gonna go on and do this and start back up again you just keep going and that would Julia Child always said here you go okay I'll let that get that going yes okay this is going to be my vanilla and that's gonna be two teaspoons and I just wanna get that going I am gonna stop this and scrape the sides hit it one more time before I start adding my dry ingredients now hopefully by this point your oven will be preheated to 360 it is important to be spot-on with this because it really is a 10 minute cookie it's very fast and I love it so with this I am going to start adding it's worth doing it a little bit at a time making it nice and perfect of course when I have this done I'm going to straight and I guess I will be right back okay here we are I incorporated all my flour let it mix you don't have to let it beat for a terribly long time I have washed my hands and seriously hot water so I'm gonna go on this is just a plain old scooper as you can see and these cookies actually don't spread a whole lot so what size you make is generally what the size is it's gonna be it's going to puff up a bit but not out okay so I like to go all the way to the top like so come together make a ball as you can see and put it there and I'm gonna continue to do so until all of my my sheets are done you maybe can see right here but actually I have used parchment paper now if you watch any of my other videos you know I have silk hats but I have a lot of dough here and so this is gonna help me just when it's done slide it right off I can put another Kretchman paper in there and keep going okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do these pans fill them up I'm gonna put them in my oven at 350 for ten minutes this is not you want to be right on with the temperature and right on with the ten minutes no more I will see you when these are done okay y'all here we are I have pulled them out after ten racks and then I have let them sit here to thoroughly cool to room temperature now again my hands are nice and clean so I'm just gonna take a few off here and show you how we're going to go ahead and plate these and finish them up you see the brown color you know we all know gingerbreads excellent but it may not be the prettiest thing to look at so the only real sugar component because I use the pure is gonna be some powdered sugar just because it's just gonna make everything look pretty I don't know anybody that doesn't like some powdered sugar on something and if you don't I don't know what's but so you can see I have powdered sugar and I'm gonna continue to do all that to every single cookie and that's just that's how I plate them it's powdered sugar and I might serve it with coffee well definitely with coffee maybe some hot cocoa all of that so I really hope y'all try this gingerbread recipe it's excellent and it's healthy for you too glute gluten-free vegan with all the wonderful spices that are always so good for you that help with antioxidants and everything especially cinnamon for your heart and just a dusting of powdered sugar and you could put whatever powder sugar you like but I'm just using regular old Domino confectioners sugar and this is what I love I'm gonna need a whole bunch of these so does my family and I hope yours does too if you like this hit thumbs up hit subscribe to tell your friend it's a family and from my family to yours have a blessed day", "fzmXaGDOvqM": "molasses cookies I'm a big fan of these guys and together

our ginger ice cream sandwich it's gonna be the perfect combination rolling these guys around I'm gonna get these into the oven 350 degrees for 9 to 10 minutes my molasses cookies are crunchy and soft and chewy at the same time", "TQflObcevcQ": "hey guys it's alex here at the health unit with a cut above the roast and here is what's your name clark and today we're going to be making what are we making cookies what kind of cookies do you know [Music] it's always the answer is always chocolate chip cookies which is not today we're making molasses cookies yum and this recipe comes from a sesame street cookbook uh that has lovely recipes and lots of different things that you can include your child with so clark can you tell him how old you are [Music] you're three yeah and you help me out in the kitchen all the time right so we're gonna mix together all the dry ingredients for this recipe you'll need some oat bran some whole wheat flour uh just a regular white flour um some molasses because the molasses cookies baking soda butter or oil cinnamon uh nutmeg ginger and actually cinnamon um cloves sorry and ginger and then an egg so we're going to put together all of our dry greens you're just antsy to go aren't we okay let's put together in one bowl and put this inside in this bowl can you put in this flour i have an extra plate here because we'll be rolling it in sugar later so there's some there's the whole wheat flour and here's some white flour beautiful and we're gonna put in some so it's one cup of each one cup whole wheat one cup white and if you don't have either of them you just do two cups of one or the other and there's some oat grain you can also use wheat bran in this recipe as well and i'm gonna put in some baking soda one and a half teaspoons okay um this in there buddy oh we're not going to actually mix with that bud okay can you put this in there or do you want me to put it in there you do it okay and then i have one half teaspoon of baking soda um we're gonna do a half a teaspoon of salt so that's out of here and then we're gonna do one teaspoon of cinnamon one teaspoon of cinnamon um oh can you keep the dry ingredients in the bowl that's cinnamon here's some cloves a half a teaspoon of cloves and a half teaspoon of ginger now if you don't have these dry ingredients these three spices in your drawer you can also just do two teaspoons of pumpkin spice and that will work out just nicely okay clark can we uh mix this up with your not spoon there you go can you mix it nicely without getting it everywhere do you want a spoon bud that might be easier no no perfect we can mix it together how's that for teamwork beautiful okay mommy's gonna set this off to the side because next we're gonna do our dry ingredients i mean everybody's you put the egg in there we're gonna put the egg in here can i get you to crack it for me yeah no you can't crack it with your spatula you have to crack it with your hands or else mommy's gonna crack it no you put it on the counter okay not with your spatula though this batch is not hard enough you actually hit it against there remember you use two hands can you show me how you do it not with your spatula okay mommy's going to crack it if you don't crack it are you ready yeah that's not how we crack eggs do you want to show yourself yeah stop okay beautiful what happened you cracked up the spatula buddy okay i'll be right back wash my hands prior to this clark had been through all the drawers in the kitchen and had found this lovely utensil that we're doing all her mixing with perfect all right well there you go why did the crocky was just i don't know how i didn't think you would but you could and you did so you did uh we're putting in a third cup of molasses i grease up the this is like really dark mustard i grease up the uh measuring uh cut beforehand i just grab a spatula so that the molasses comes out relatively easily otherwise it's super sticky it's been a little while since i poured this all right one third of a cup of molasses now you can do either butter or um oil with the rest of this recipe i've done both so um i today i'm just gonna do uh three quarters of a cup of butter but you can do either you can also just do a half a cup of oil these with you're gonna do them with uh butter they're gonna be chewier they're going to be like a softer cookie versus if you do it with oil perfect so what we're going to do is i'm going to actually this would be a little tricky to do with the spatula hey buddy can i take this away you can hold on to it just don't put in your mouth i'm going to use a hand mixer now you can do this by hand you can do this with a hand mixer you can do it in a stand mixer as well so i'm just going to mix this up okay buddy oh we need to put some sugar in here as well i'm forgetting about the sugar [Music] beautiful and let me put the sugar in as well so we're going to start two thirds of a cup of sugar now you can put in the wet or dry ingredients i'm just gonna put in here can you put that in there are you [Music] i don't know if i want to put this back in this spoon we got some raw egg on it okay whoa two goodness large all right now we're getting stuff flicking everywhere so we're gonna put this down okay and then we're gonna mix this up looking lovely so this recipe the reason i love it with him especially because there's multiple steps that can help out with not only can you help out with mixing the wet and the dry ingredients it can't really help with this but we're gonna we're gonna roll these into balls and roll them into sugar which you love doing don't you clark yeah are you gonna can you pour that in there okay so we're not supposed to pour in a little bit at a time not all at once but now that it's all at once might as well just go for it and i'm just going to collect some of this from the counter just so that our recipe turns out because that looks like about a half a cup of flour that just got dumped onto the oh my okay now we're going to mix this in and then [Music] it's not loud anymore i can make it a little bit louder you want it quieter well it's not that loud actually this one's pretty quiet compared to what we have at home or the one at home is much louder and we're gonna mix this up until the dough gets nice and soft and it's all the ingredients are mixed in now because it's not gonna make into like a perfect like dough it's going to kind of slow down the mixing yeah okay we're almost done actually you can see here it's like um it's like it's still break a bar but it's all like kind of sitting together just going to throw this up front these to the side and we are ready to start rolling these into some sugar and putting them onto our baking sheet so i'm just gonna get our baking sheet up front i put parchment paper on it you could grease it up as well i'm going to take a spoon and dump a little bit of sugar onto your plate can you break up those big clumps i got on there buddy we can put more if we need more and i have a cookie scoop here and the cookie scoop's great oh okay okay no eating the sugar buddy this is for the baking right and then afterwards we can have a cookie together how does that sound don't no don't blow it either because it's going to make a mess full of it today clark aren't we okay so i'm going to take them perfect and i'm going to roll them up into oh these look these are nice and soft okay and can you roll that oh i should wear apron roll them in the sugar and then can you put them on the measuring on the cup oh my gosh on the baking sheet please beautiful clark that looks awesome now you can make these um i'm just using like a regular cookie scoop you could make yep beautiful we're gonna start throwing them on here sometimes i also get my own plates just so i can speed this up oh gosh yep don't throw them and don't wipe your hands on your shirt buddy uh just so your hands are gonna be sticky for a little bit and then we'll wash them afterwards okay does that sound good clark can you can you see your abcs [Music] i'm going to turn over a little bit slower that's pretty fast with who okay clark you need to stop wiping your hands do you want do you want um i need your towel here buddy wipe your hands on the towel okay buddy not on your shirt not don't okay don't let the towel on your shirt just wipe it yes and so um if you're making these with kiddos expect that your cookies are not gonna look round at all and what you're gonna do is you're gonna put them maybe a space a little bit nicer than what i have over here and um once you get them all kind of put together you're going to do a couple more you're going to get a glass and you're going to flatten them can you can you roll these in the sugar spark these last trouble two then we can count can we count these afterwards clark to see how many cookies we have on the sheet i think that'd be fun eh three okay yep roll this one together perfect three oh no the other spacer part a bit so that they're not and i'm going to flatten them okay just so that they bake a little bit more evenly and clark can you count them huh can you count them for me let's count them together let's point and count together one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 13 14 15 15. good job buddy okay so we're gonna put these in the oven 350 degrees and it's for 10 minutes okay and then after that you gotta put them on a cooling rod to let them cool thoroughly and then you can try them after that but we'll be back to taste test them right clark that's yes bye [Music] hey guys we're back and this guy could not hold off on trying the cookies how are they they're good um they spread way more than i thought they would so keep them a little bit further apart but otherwise it came out they're beautiful they're nice and soft and chewy should we make these again anyways thanks for joining us today happy baking enjoy don't mind the mess you get a step at a time and we'll see you next time bye you say bye you", "WX-5PUnclj4": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some homestyle archway classic soft cookies we have the iced oatmeal oatmeal raisin and I have the ice molasses Kevin's were a little bit more because they go bad that were $2.99 at Kroger these were 268 at Walmart two months 12 ounces these are not yeah so that's been exploited so red truck the soft iced oatmeal cookies they come in a completely filled pocket one cookie 33 grams is a house 40 gallon the website is definitely giving out archway cookies calm and they're on Facebook under archway cookies sadly though good sauce cookie you want that whole thing right mmm cause we're gonna be drawing three huh oh the texture okay it's soft its cover I don't say chewy but it's a chew - mm-hmm then you get the whole film of that icing yeah it's kind of like for spicing now - I know that's where we go that has a delicious flavor I really like that seems like I've had these boots them like cinnamon yeah you could taste the cinnamon in it and there's something else maybe nothing I guess on there's some other spices yeah I was looking to see what else I'm assumin same drought raisin paste because I was real worried myself it tasted like it had right then I knew we were gonna try the race I thought oh they wouldn't but raising this because those raisin in the next one but it does a brace of pace so and they do water how different are these gonna be because these are these are oatmeal raisin and they're 140 calories for one make sure you get some raisin cinnamon let's say oh you can actually see so this has raisins in it hmm that's good mm-hmm you definitely taste the raisins but they don't put as much of that cinnamon in there and I really liked it takes that feminine oxidant I like the I like em both I love the texture both of them but I like the added sweetness from that icing oh yeah you get from the know these all must have a gingerbread new kind of flavor there's a definitely the oatmeal are sweeter because of that I think it you wouldn't think it would make that big of a difference but it really does your Jim I noticed on their website they make just these are ice molasses but they also make just regular my license and I only got two goes my shortbread cookie too and they have another one too gingersnap yeah and I didn't say huh are you gonna hot butter these are not class these are three cookies 33 grams is 130 there's their small that's definitely how about you these have raisin paste and cinnamon no those are mommy of ginger never gingerbread a really soft ginger button you see how like that oh my god nothing ginger but it reminds me gingerbread that texture I think that's good yeah it's a good cookie but I think you were afraid when I was gonna balance yeah that there would be too molasses eat and I think that if they didn't have the icing it would be better I think yeah I think I can't imagine the ones that don't have that icing cuz I like that a little bit of sweetness me yeah I think those are really know they're really good ah my favorite spill the ice oh really yes very much softer than what I was expecting you know they they can say soft on a lot of cookies but are they really soft these really are resolved yeah very very good so out of the three days road that's what I mean yeah these would be the number one so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "cXkpjapBxnM": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at another product from milk-and-cookies the terribly neighborhood still have the price tag on it $10 you can see there go ahead and take that off milk and cookies the weirdly named and even weird early logoed edibles we are taking a look at their 20 dose which means 200 milligram red velvet cookie will read the terrible description on the back and then we'll dig into the review here okay so here's what they say sink your teeth into a satin red velvet cookie Edurne adorned with swirls of buttercream frosting and sprinkled with sugary bling each velvety bite reveals sweet silky buttercream atop a decadent red pillow go ahead lick the frosting my first we won't tell who sultry sexy now I've got my scissors here because L edible this packaging is terrible and for whatever reason does not actually include a way to open it without scissors I think that's a terrible decision a design decision of mine but you know that's what they have decided so Milton that these guys I reviewed quite a few products from them I find them to be mixed too bad for the confectionary edibles some of the things are okay like they're [ __ ] brownie and their regular brownie I found to be okay but most of their 200 milligram cookies or their rice krispies treats do not seem to get me where I want to be but they are reasonably priced so this is a $10 cookie which is a good deal for a 200 milligram edible if it were as potent as a 200 milligram edible should or could be alright so for whatever reason this cookie a little smushed too so I brought the patented wheats plate here to dump it out on I think it was purchased smushed but you know smush just one way of eating something it's just you know oh jeez it's really banged up alright so that's a knock against it is how easily this thing gets banged up so there is all the cookie the red velvet cookie all banged and crumbed up let's give it a bite so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way we do our reviews is I'm gonna eat some of this cookie I'll eat the whole thing I just don't abort you to death by eating it all in front of you hidden camera but I'm gonna eat it all over the next couple of minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review is not the way it tastes but how it makes you feel so let's go ahead and get a smell and taste test here no real discernible weed odor what's mmm that is better than I thought it was going to be then it's not bad and I'm not even a huge red velvet fan but that's pretty good well no we taste whatsoever or if there isn't it's masked by the cookie and the buttercream frosting buttercream frosting is good very neutral sort of taste and the cookie itself is very moist very soft and delicious I like it but as I just said who can't outrace well I care how it tastes you should care how it tastes too but well you should really care about is how it makes you feel and for that guys I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thank you so much for watching wheats I'll see you soon I'm back my friends it has been two hours since I had the MILF and cookies 200 milligram red velvet cookie and it's a pleasant little surprise I I liked it I am enjoying it um it's not great but compared to the other milk and cookies 200 milligram urse I think this is my favorite it tastes surprisingly good I was really surprised with how good it tastes and I'm um I'm not high out of my mind but I'm pretty high average n for a 200 milligrams so tastes good and above our writer average I would say high for a 200 milligram uh would not be my first choice I I would probably spend a little bit of extra money and go with a similar thing product from Korova or canna Co similar milligram egde but I don't think you're gonna be dissatisfied with the milk and cookies red velvet cookie if you happen to pick one up and if you're a huge fan of red velvet definitely give it a go you'll you'll love the taste and you'll find yourself uh pleasantly hi so this is a thumbs up from me it's again it's not fantastic it's not the best I've ever had but it is better than a lot of the other milk and cookies so if you see it under dispensary near you and you like red velvet go for it it's a good edible

poufy and delicious we have some Earth Balance here I've used vegan basal Mis recipe before but almost all butters like vegan butters are like interchangeable basically some of them may have a little bit more spread than others because the water content is slightly different but it'll taste the same so we're gonna start in we're just gonna put that all in there this is a combination of the Earth Balance and the tub and the Earth Balance of the sticks because I ran out of the stuff in the tub so I had to go into the sticks we have some vegan butter we have some white sugar and I don't know what it is about you Americans but sometimes you guys get really mad at me for using white sugar but yeah in Canada most of our sugar is bone char free so it's speaking I'm just like chill you use what sugar is best for you okay all right so we're gonna turn this on real low do its magic you know all right she fluffy now I think in my original recipe I didn't put any vanilla in but I'm gonna put some in you don't have to add it but I'm gonna feel like I just feel like it it's expensive right now you totally don't need to do it but I'm doing it okay we're gonna add some molasses obviously this gives a lot of that deep dark delicious flavor and color and sweetness so we're just gonna add that in and you know what you can feel good about eating these cookies because the molasses are a very good source of iron so know if you if you want some iron eat a cookie you're also gonna want some probably some citrus some vitamin C somewhere so maybe have like a glass of apple cider not the most traditional accompaniment for cookies but you know what you know you man got to make that iron more bioavailable wearing that sad lisa is the same as like drunk lisa sassy with a lot of flack I guess that's the same thing as sassy moody I'm just Moody guys I just want to eat the cookies all right so molasses in and you know what I'm gonna give this flax egg that I started a little stir Easter so this is just flax meal and water and that's what creates that egg texture replacement thing because it binds it together I'm not get those mothers on the table ever immediately regret the decision and that tastes like blood it doesn't taste like blood but it's very metallic in flavor but that's okay we're just gonna smooth that out with some sheep to creep down the skies a little bit you know gonna help your beter s it looks like chocolate but don't be fooled it's not I don't know why means so aggressive so we've got our flex egg goo happenin so now it's time to add the egg the vegan egg the flax egg to the mixture so we're time today scrape down the edges once more make sure you get the bottom two because sometimes the bottom doesn't like to be mixed in but you gotta mix it all in y'all just realize there's a huge chunk at the top here that didn't get incorporated what do you do it get with the program I'm trying to make delicious cookies nobody wants a streaky cookie come on now we're gonna incorporate our spices so we have some cinnamon some ginger some cloves baking soda my original recipe also has nutmeg but I can't find my nutmeg for some reason so I just add a little bit extra cinnamon I pretty sure I'm allergic to nutmeg cuz it makes my tongue numb so I'm just not gonna have it but you do you nutmeg is delicious add that in there you know we're gonna salt well salty salty you know who's salty today me blend that in okay and now we add the flour so your mixture is gonna look like wet poo but that's okay flour we're gonna add a little bit at a time the first third is gonna go in and then we're gonna slowly incorporate it otherwise it's just gonna go put your face nobody wants that little bit more straight be scraping [Music] last bit of flour it's time to just double-check everything is incorporated and also I'm gonna use my cookie scape everything's better with the cookie scoop we just scrape all this cookie dough off you don't want to over mix it so we're just gonna do the last little bits by hand grab the stuff at the bottom because I see that it has not been completely incorporated so I'm just gonna do that real quick but you don't want to work with your hands too much because you don't want to melt the dough but it's a very soft pliable dough all right she mixed it it smells like gingerbread you can do a little taste test just to make sure it tastes good mmm it new we've got some spicy stuff so now what you do is you roll it into a ball and then you dip it in some coarse sugar you could also dip it in cinnamon sugar or just regular sugar but I find coarse sugar adds just a little extra as you know think what I mean it's not too sweet they're like not as sweet as like regular sugar crystals but they're bigger and they're crunchy err they're just more fun all right and this cookie scoop I think is it's one and a half teaspoon so that's the size of the cookie balls that I'm putting now so I'm gonna scoop out all these cookie dough balls and I'm gonna roll them in sugar and then we're gonna bake them for I'm pretty sure eight minutes in a 350-degree oven or if you have a stupid oven like mine that's actually a lot hotter than it actually is then about 325 I'll see you when these cookies are done baking and then I can eat them on camera and maybe be a little bit happier who knows these cookies are now baked not all of them I still have maybe one more match in here I have one in the oven I got one over here just pulled out the oven still steaming still hot and I'm gonna eat a cookie cuz I just really want to cooking at crunchy outside still under baked on the inside so when they cool completely they'll be like super chewy delicious this cookie really doesn't make everything better so good the molasses make it like extra moist and delicious mmm I feel a lot better now if you guys mother's recipe I'll leave it linked down below and I'll link some other of my cookie recipes for you guys if you guys have other holiday baking you wanna get up too I also have an old holiday dessert video until it's pretty old by the production value a little bit yeah also before I discovered I was allergic to pecans so that's the thing anyway so if you guys want this recipe I'll leave a link down below I hope you make it and if you do please tag me on Instagram Twitter Facebook I love seeing what you do and I probably share it as well mostly on Instagram and Twitter I'll retweet thanks guys so much watching and I hope you guys have delicious day Bono bar I'm having a terrible day we knew it it really does look like what poop yeah [Music]", "OET_K19ooFI": "I told you we're gonna make something that was new you seen the chip which is like they have in the grocery store the little ice-cream sandwiches that have Oh Lord yes I make them I make them for my kids we decided we were gonna make one with molasses cookies and a bacon sort of ice cream on the inside of us bacon ice cream well let me let me show you what I'm fixing to do Kevin I didn't have any stop I'm gonna cheat and use this crazy pad I'm not gonna tell our show and I think people are gonna find out so I think it's okay to cheat now and then I wouldn't do it on a regular basis so I threw a cup and a half of sugar in here just white sugar and then this whole stick of butter here yes yes [Music] orders up a cup of cake flour and then I'm gonna get right here this man this is bread flour I'm gonna have a bread flour why do you do that bread flours got a lot of gluten you know so it's to here and I like the molasses cookies really chewy I'm gonna add some baking soda to this it's about two teaspoons of baking soda uh-huh and now this is the part that you kind of eyeball here is your spices cuz it's about what you preferred I like yeah so we'll use almost a whole tablespoon of ginger nice and spicy it is gonna bake we got some clove and some cinnamon and I think you want to bow it is strong these are strong cookies but once you mix them with the other stuff exactly we know we actually make them in fancy words it's a semifreddo so it's like yeah it's like frozen mousse see you chefs I don't once you get it mixed up like this where it's kind of soft and granular we're gonna mix in like about a third of a cup of molasses to it stick right up put some eggs right here did you crack me one up and throw it right on there just one one one egg this is the part where the mess comes mm-hmm put in the flour all of it one time now the key here is to not let this thing take off at full blast otherwise the kitchen will be covered in flour I kind of already look like Casper but yeah we'll look a little bit more like Casper yeah you did you're very creamy exactly me white [Music] you can see I got some of these balls right here I'm telling you them some good Roma Roman sugar you can only get about six of them on a sheet tray because they're gonna spread out a whole bunch so how they are yeah well I throw them in the oven here in a minute they're gonna go about 375 depending on how hot your oven is you might have to go up a little bit or down a little bit but the thing is and this is where people screw up this recipe is that you don't let it cook until they're crispy look like pork tenderloin is perfect that is delicious yeah that's really good in that yummy you open that door for fried corn Tommy what you talking about four minutes we'll come back we'll check on my spin him around we'll be good to go have a 4-minute cookie what is this that's bacon bacon yes ma'am I'm gonna grab that semifreddo that we've made up okay and bring it over here we can make some of these sandwiches oh my gosh Kevin my husband I don't want to marry you I'm already spoken for but he loves these kind of cookies I love junk food and I'm always trying to find ways to recreate it and so I took my old fashioned molasses cookie recipe that I also got from my granny and we made a caramel and bacon ice cream to go on the inside of our chip which there you go all right I'm gonna can I cut this into okay I'm gonna make another one oh okay right give us another one Kevin Kevin Kevin what do you think mmm that bacon on my ice cream in those cookies was incredible is this how you serve it at the restaurant a bowl of bacon or you know sometimes we'll roll the sides in it make the sides be covered in bacon most the time at the restaurant we made these a little bit smaller than this most people in a nice kind of fancy restaurant don't like to manhandle [Music] you", "mYR8Kjai5Z0": "hello welcome to you know sweet creations christmas is arriving and it's time to bake our Christmas cookies today I'm going to give you my favorite recipe for gingerbread cookies next week will be to my favorite recipe for chocolate cookies and in two weeks I'll show you how to decorate them as pretty as this one for this recipe you will need 800 grams all purpose flour 250 gram unsalted butter 1 cup dark brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 cup molasses 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon 3 teaspoons ground ginger 1 teaspoon ground cloves and 1 teaspoon salt all ingredients you will need for this recipe are listed down below on the video description start by sifting and mixing all dry ingredients which are flour salt ginger cinnamon and cloves in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment mix butter and brown sugar on medium speed until fluffy if you need scrape down the sides of the bowl and spatula mix in eggs one at a time and then molasses now it is beat to now scrape down the bowl again and add the dry ingredients don't over mix it so just until combined even environment and ingredients used affect baking so if your dough is a bit sticky add flour and knead it until it's soft to the touch but doesn't stick to your fingers Rollo out between parchment paper and let it rest by refrigerating it until coals for about one hour [Music] meanwhile preheat your oven to about 180 degrees Celsius use the spacers to roll your dough all with the same height or thickness and cut out cookie shapes if the edges are not pretty pass your fingers along to help smooth those frizzy edges place them on baking sheets lined with parchment paper approximately 2 centimeters apart refrigerate them until firm for at least 15 minutes in the freezer or 1 hour in the fridge bake cookies until lightly golden for about 10 to 14 minutes depending on the size and thickness of the cookie before they cool down smooth the surface with a smoother so they get a very flat surface which will be perfect to decorate or type let them now cool down on sheets on wire racks it's marvelous you should try I hope you come and visit my channel again next week so you don't lose my absolutely favorite recipe the chocolate cookies recipe I hope to see you next week bye right", "rwtCJahrEro": "hi there welcome back to Patty's kitchen hey gallon of milk what goes great with a gallon of milk I know there's a lot of different answers however my number one answer would be cookies so what's your favorite cookie I have a lot of favorites there's really not a cookie out there that I don't like but we have chocolate chip we have molasses peanut butter oatmeal raisin but I've had a couple people asking for the molasses so today is going to be molasses cookies with milk all right set that aside the first ingredient we're going to start with is a half a cup of margarine just going to pop that in there and a half a cup of shortening again just stick it right in there one and a half cups of sugar just going to add those all together and we're going to mix them and that's our creaming method we're mixing them up I'll halfway through we're going to scrape the sides down so I still have some dry stuff in the bottom so scrape the sides down helps mix it up a little bit better mix it up a little bit more so is that during the wintertime I love baking cookies I just love it okay next ingredient two eggs half a cup of molasses I actually buy molasses by the gallon he said tells you I do a lot of baking huh okay got that mix that together again I'm going to scrape down the sides guys I got some that's not quite mixed up scrape it down mix it up a little bit more okay now i have to grab my cheat sheet here i can't i can't rely all on memory you know all right half a teaspoon of salt you guys are probably laughing at me now that's okay two and a half teaspoons of baking soda two and a half teaspoons of ginger one-and-a-half teaspoons of cloves one-and-a-half teaspoons of cinnamon now tell me could you guys remember all that yeah it's four cups of flour I'm going to start out with two cups flour just a little mix easier so there's my first two cups started it out on slow because if you don't you're going to have flour all over the kitchen now I don't feel like cleaning and this time i will have all my ingredients written out on a piece of paper for you guys because somebody gave me a friendly suggestion to do that so that was a very good suggestion i think that was from d but i'm not sure all right so i have my two cups in there i'm going to add the other two cups of flour slowly mix it sometimes when it starts out a little bit overflows all right it's going to be kind of a thick dough get it mixed up good I'm going to scrape the sides down probably for the last time all right give it another shot mix it on high once it's all mixed up exit down high mixed up really good that's good all right clean off the beater here take that off all right save what we can guys are probably all wondering who this show or this episode is going to be dedicated to you'll find out in the very end alright so now that that's all mixed up take the bowl off this right out of my way grab my cookie sheet and I use ice cream scoops that get you the most perfect cookie I have a small one right here but you can get all different sizes and you are from really small ones to half cup but half cup cookies pretty big so as you can see taking my cookie scoop and I'm and I'm rubbing the dough right up the side to make it perfectly flat okay and I'm dropping it into a bowl of granulated sugar toss it around then I'm going to line them up on my cookie sheet just like that then we're going to slide them into the oven at 350 degrees we're going to start out with about 14 to 15 minutes keep a really close eye on this is a funny cookie you actually want to pull them out of the oven when they still feel and look a little bit raw not quite done because they will set up they will set up and that's what makes them really does when they're just slightly soft in the middle if you wait till they're totally when they totally feel done it's over done so don't do that alright so now you get the idea I'm going to slide these into the oven so I get them all hand up once i bring them out of the oven i'm going to show you what they all look like okay see you in a couple minutes alright i'm going to show you what I mean they become crackly on top and it almost looks like it's a little dull we in the middle we want that in fact when you bring them out you can let them cool right on the cookie sheet because the little extra time that the baked on the cookie sheet is fine so with that I'm going to pour glass milk and then you guys are going to find out who these are for Laura's little added thing here not only am I dedicating somebody I'm going to send them to him any guesses I've actually sent some of these two pastor Steve in the past but not today today Andrew this is for you mmm love it now you guys will excuse me I have to package ease up and get these sent out to my buddy Andy until next time see you hey be sure if you guys ever want to see any other episode go to youtube with Patti's kitchen thanks for joining you", "vn5CiP7Ag0Q": "[Music] hi today we are going to make soft molasses cookies we're excited about that and i didn't have a chip hat so look at me with my santa hat let's see what do we need to make the cookies we will need all purpose flour baking soda ground cinnamon cardamon nutmeg salt unsalted butter softened to room temperature dark brown sugar granulated sugar dark molasses [Music] one large egg vanilla extract and for rolling we need 67 grams of sugar any sugar that you would like [Music] we are going to whisk together the flour first let's put it here all the flour second the baking soda then so for baking soda one and a half teaspoons next step with cinnamon let's do that [Music] step is cardamom so that we have to put a little bit here so that's that the next step is nutmeg this one i also need a little oh it smells strong [Music] and last is don't have the normal salt at the moment so i have to use the mediterranean sea salt too much just a little bit too much and now we are going to whisk it all together [Music] we keep going [Music] and then we just put it to the side it's going to wait for us so next we are going to put together the butter which needs to be room temperature and both of the sugars and do it in a large bowl we need 170 grams of butter temperature butter [Music] and we're gonna add in both of the sugars the brown sugar and the white sugar so it should mix for two minutes to make it really creamy and next we're going to add the molasses in [Music] and now we let it mix [Music] all right when that's done we're going to stop it it looks really good and now we are going to add in the egg [Music] perfect and vanilla extract two teaspoons [Music] now we let it mix again [Music] all right that's been two minutes now and that is more than enough looks very good now what we have to do is scrub down the side make sure it all gets in [Music] all right and now slowly you're going to mix the dry ingredients in so let me put a little bit right now and then on a very slow level i'm gonna start mixing it [Music] and you are slowly going to add the dry [Applause] [Music] ingredients [Music] so for the next step you have to cover it with foil or just with a plastic wrap is fine as well and then we have the it also remember it needs to be boiled very tightly and then we're going to the fridge let's hope it's gonna fit here it's a perfect fit all right and then we're gonna see it later when almost an hour is passed um warm up your oven set it to 350 and also put ready your parchment paper all right it's been an hour let's see how it turned out [Music] you guys you can even hold them in the fridge for two to three days if you want but when you do that then you just have to leave it for the room temperature after that for about half an hour so that you can make the cookies better it's also possible to put the dough in the freezer and keep it there for up to three months and in three months if you feel like oh my god i really want those cookies right now you can make them and you don't have to start from the scratch you just take the bowl from the freezer such a smart idea for the next step we take a tablespoon full of doll it's very nice and cold now so it's easy to make oops and then you take it and you are going to make a little ball out of it so next i have here white sugar when the little ball is ready we are going to dip it in sugar [Music] we're done we're going to place it on the pan [Music] and we keep doing that now because you're ready now and they're going in the oven bake the cookies for 12 minutes [Music] perfect all right so i'm going to do a little bit more because i still have a doll left it's been 12 minutes now and they look ready and guys it smells amazing like it smells so so good can't wait to try one already [Music] so the cookies are ready now and we're gonna do a taste test so it's still warm let's try so good they're soft [Music] they smell amazing they taste amazing they look amazing too they are overall so amazing [Music] oh good guys try those cookies try to make them they are good and you know what they do they give you a christmas feeling and they bring this like kind of like crispness to smell to your house it's so good okay let me finish eating my cookie bye guys you", "yxdHdE3JT9Y":

is Lindsay welcome back to another episode of fairy tales and food today you've seen him in truck you've seen of another movies you read about them we're talking about the gingerbread man although we are doing our own little twist we are making molasses ginger cookies it's a family recipe that I absolutely love so I'm really excited about today so let's get cooking [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so we've made our cookies and I'm so happy with how they came out they look perfect like it they're perfectly circle they're good size now I get to eat them I'm very happy right now I love how certain foods can kind of take you back to a time in place and these definitely remind me of Christmas time at my parents house we used to make ten different types of cookies this is a family favorite and done they're not just for Christmas though because my grandpa loves these so we'll have them in the middle of July we'll make them again and fall just cuz so that's what's great about cookies is you don't need an excuse to eat a cookies so I'm going to keep eating these both of them for sure but this has been great hi everyone miss Jessa here and I am super excited to try these ginger molasses cookies that Lindsay made they're even still warm from the oven this is so delightful and very happy with this cookie I'm even happier that it's not shaped like the gingerbread man you know if you guys watch the Humpty Dumpty episode it's a little concerned about eating a fairy tale creature came into this gingerbread experience a little nervous that I would be eating another one but we're not we're eating circles and now it's more of a half moon anyway so I'm going to finish my snack I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and we'll see you next time on fairy tales and food you", "yp8SqMctPWs": "[Music] so [Music]", "Ilt3cHCH2Ls": "today I'm gonna teach you how to make my favorite kind of cookies everybody welcome back to living traditions homestead this is Kevin well as you know when Sarah's in the kitchen she's always teaching you guys how to make healthy healthy meals for the family but when I'm in the kitchen I teach you guys how to make snack food so I usually I'm making something like my homemade crackers or bagels or something like that but I've been havin kind of a sweet craving lately and I thought I'd show you guys how to make one of my favorite cookies homemade soft molasses cookies now these I'm telling you they won't last long once you make them because you're gonna eat them all probably in the first night so they're super easy to make they don't take very long if you live out in the country like we do you can probably whip up a batch of these faster then you could run to the store buy some Oreos anyway so let's get started now don't worry about writing down measurements I'll put the recipe below so you guys can not just print that out and make them yourselves so just follow along we're going to get started the first thing that we're going to do is use a cup of brown sugar we used just cane sugar because it's non-gmo we don't like to buy the GMO stuff so if you get a chance buy cane sugar the next thing we're going to use is 1/2 of a cup of butter so one stick of butter unsalted is best and then I'm going to also use 1/3 of a cup of coconut oil now the original recipe that I used to have for this before I made all of my good adjustments was to use a whole cup of butter but I'd like to use half a cup of butter and 1/3 of a cup of coconut oil so so perfect put that in then we're going to use a quarter of a cup of molasses now we use sorghum molasses here on the homestead we buy it it's May it's produced right here in Missouri a local farm we can buy this sorghum molasses this stuff is awesome if you can get sorghum molasses where you are I highly recommend that you do it but otherwise any molasses will do so a quarter of a cup of molasses I get that all of our mixing bowl and then we're going to use one large egg and a teaspoon of vanilla now we buy vanilla beans and make our own but again just regular vanilla will work so now looks like about a teaspoon perfect now we're going to take this over to our mixer and we're going to blend this all together until it's creamed together so let's go over there all right now that we have that all creamed together we're going to add our dry ingredients we're going to start with a teaspoon of cinnamon and we like to use Ceylon cinnamon it's much healthier for you than the cinnamon that you just buy in the store so if you've got to do some research on that you may want to switch as well Ceylon cinnamon is a a much better for you we also have some a teaspoon of organic ground ginger 1/2 of a teaspoon of pink Himalayan salt and 2 teaspoons of baking powder so we're going to add that into our mixer get that going and then we're going to add two and a half cups of flour now we use organic all-purpose flour but again any all-purpose flour will work so let's head back over to the mixer alright get that mixed in I think we need just a little bit more flour [Music] perfect let's take this back over to the counter all right so what I forgot to mention earlier on is that you should have your oven preheating to 325 you want it pretty low so 325 so now the next thing we're going to do now that we have our dough nice here it's a pretty soft dough remember they do be soft cookies so we're going to oil a baking sheet I'm going to use just a tiny bit of sunflower oil here you can use the spray if you want you can use parchment paper nice leave a little bit of oil this is nice now what we're going to do is we're going to make these into T tablespoon sized balls and then we're going to use just a little bit of regular sugar we again just like with the brown sugar we use cane sugar so it's non-gmo but it's a white sugar and then we're going to put the balls on the baking sheet and as soon as the oven is preheated we'll put them in the oven now I don't actually measure them so again about felt like that and just roll them around in the sugar and onto the baking sheet I'll just do this until the baking it you just pull they just fit about a dozen on each sheet all right I've got two dozen rolled out put in the sugar and now we're going to put these in the oven the ovens preheated again at 325 we're gonna put these in total for 14 minutes I like to set the timer for seven minutes and just check on them they should flatten out pretty nicely but in my experience sometimes they just don't and I don't know why so after seven minutes if they haven't flattened out then I just use a spatula to just you know flatten them out a little bit so I'm going to put now for seven minutes and then we'll check on them oh and by the way I have enough dough left in the fridge for probably another dozen so this makes quite a few alright it's been seven minutes let's look at them and see how they're doing they're looking okay but they haven't flattened out nearly as much as I would've liked so what I'm gonna do is just take my spatula kind of make them look cool anyway and I don't know maybe they're not supposed to flatten out I just like flat cookies I guess they look bigger do you feel like you're eating more so this is how I always do them so we're going to flatten these out and then we'll put them back in for another seven minutes and hopefully then they'll be done I'll probably check them in five just to make sure all right they're all finished time to take them out of the oven got my cooling racks here we're just put them out and let them cool they won't take long and they'll be ready to eat there we go they're all done they look awesome they smell even better and I can't wait for them to cool off enough that I can start eating them you guys this is a super easy recipe I highly recommend that you try it if you like molasses cookies I guarantee you're gonna love these hey if this is your first time

"LQrBg1ymUXc": "hey everybody welcome back to the dolls of desserts baking channel in my opinion I think it's a bit early for this but holiday paraphernalia is literally everywhere you look now however it's still fall so I don't want to necessarily jump right into the Christmas cookie recipes with all the peppermint and all that so today we're gonna do something that is Christmas as well as fall today we were making gluten-free and vegan ginger molasses cookies thoughts of desserts ginger molasses cookies are really unique typically ginger molasses cookies recipes call for cinnamon

everything Dolf of desserts and so without further ado let's get making these fall holiday Christmas cookies these ginger molasses cookies we're actually gonna be breaking out the stand mixer and now if you have a hand mixer at home that's totally fine the reason we're using a mixer is because we want to aerate the coconut oil in a solid form not liquid to be able to give the cookies a nice texture and overall delicious and homogeneous flavor so the first thing we're gonna do is actually cream some coconut oil as well as a little bit of brown sugar you feel free to use coconut sugar or whatever sugar replacement but you want that is granulated and we're going to beat it in our mixer on high speed for approximately 3 four minutes while it's feeding and get your flax pack out of your blondie mix and pour it into some water stir it up and let it sit to the side partway through mixing make sure you scrape down the sides and then once everything's been mixed make sure you add in your molasses the flax egg and eventually you're going to be adding in all of your spices in the dolls of desserts ginger molasses cookie which is ginger crazy we're going to be adding in about a tablespoon to a tablespoon and a half of freshly grated ginger as well as two teaspoons of ginger 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper I know luckily cookies what is she thinking and same with cocoa what is this trust me it's a perfect balance the block of burn deepens the spiciness that you get from the ginger well the cocoa helps cut and smooth out the flavors you don't actually taste the cocoa powder it's kind of just something to make sure that the ginger and the black pepper doesn't kill you once you put all those ingredients in you're gonna continue mixing it on high speed for about 4 to 5 minutes everything should start coming together and be this black goopy mixture and once you have beat that all together you're going to of course pour in your baking mix while doing this you might also want to add in 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda or baking powder this depends on if you want a spread out flat crispy cookie or a little bit more more puffy cookie oh another 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum just to hold it all to get there a little bit better and the last thing you're also going to add which isn't films here is you're going to add in 2/3 a cup of some sort of gluten-free flour I used oak flour but feel free to use any grain based flour 2/3 of a cup will help bring the dough from a very sticky base to a more of a cookie dough phase it's still gonna be super soft you're gonna have to take this dough and you're gonna have to freeze it for at least an hour before you could even start working with it once your batter has been in the freezer for an hour and it's chilled you are going to take a tablespoon or you're gonna take a regular soup spoon you're gonna take some small balls whatever size you want you're gonna roll them in your hands and then you're going to DES them in some more sugar turbinado sugar is a for this I only had brown sugar lying around my house so I just rolled them in some more brown sugar but you can use coconut sugar any granulated sugar with a large granule will work best and then you're not gonna hope you can spread them out a tiny bit but not too much just make sure there's a lot of space between each cookie because these cookies oh boy do they spread so make sure they are well separated apart and small because they will literally triple in size once your cookies have all been balled out you're going to put that whole pan into the freezer again for at least an hour and then once your cookies are frozen you're gonna bake them at 350 degrees for approximately 15 minutes if you want a softer cookie I recommend baking it for 12 minutes but they're gonna be really goopy and soft also adding baking powder will help ensure that they don't spread as much less surface area means they might be more poufy in the middle rather than thin and crispy once you pull them out let them cool completely before you eat them and then that's it oh yes oh yes you see here they're perfect for your holiday cookie boxes to give you the friends they're a small little shape there but like yeah they're but the size of my palm they're nice and thin they're crispy on the outside soft on the inside and of course they bear the unique ingenue Moss its flavored other than just being a cinnamon spiced ginger cacophony they're actually ginger molasses and other spices so let's all right these are super delicious cuz once you taste can be seen those on all year round with you I have to say favorite a reminder Christmas thank you so much for tuning in and watching our

"wAcNWxM49M0": "hi my name is lily and for our how-to videos for english 101 i will be showing you all how to make ginger molasses cookies they're my favorite fall cookie and you know it's fall so i thought i'd show you all how to make them i hope you like them all right so first we're going to be mixing all of our dry ingredients together as a side note i would use a bigger bowl for this than i did i just liked how pretty this one was so we're going to need three and a half cups of flour and to the flour we're going to be adding one teaspoon of salt and now we're getting to our spices so first we're gonna add one and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon um and then after the cinnamon we're going to be adding just one teaspoon of ginger you can see i smelled it there i love ginger and after the ginger we're adding one and a quarter teaspoon of cloves or allspice allspice works as well and as soon as i add those cloves we're gonna get to my favorite part the nutmeg i like to freshly grind my nutmeg um right there you see i have the little nutmeg bulb i guess and i am freshly grinding it away it smells so good when you do this and our final dry ingredient is baking soda you're going to be adding two and a quarter teaspoons to your dry ingredients and then you're going to just mix them all up until they're pretty well combined like i said use a bigger bowl all right and now we're moving on to our wet ingredients this recipe calls for 16 tablespoons or just two sticks of softened butter but if you're like me and didn't leave your butter out overnight so it is room temperature you can pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds and it gets pretty gloopy like what you see here and it works out perfect and to the butter we're going to be adding one cup of just granulated sugar you can use brown sugar if you want but this recipe has molasses going into it already so you don't really need to and you want to mix these together until they're fluffy and well combined if your butter is soft this shouldn't take too long and just mix and mix and mix them until it's fluffy almost to our butter sugar mixture we are going to be adding two eggs you want these to also be room temperature i did i left these out for a few hours before i made this so it worked out mix until combined and then we're gonna add the star of the show our molasses any molasses will do um and look at that pour in you're going to be adding half a cup of molasses but if you really want an extra ginger kick you can do a quarter cup of molasses and a quarter cup of ginger syrup and now we are combining our wet and dry ingredients i like to add a little bit of the dry at a time that way it just doesn't overwhelm anything and you can kind of get it well combined a lot easier this is quite a lot of flour you're adding so you can totally use a little stand mixer i just prefer to use my hands because it's a bit more of a dry recipe so just being able to work it with a spoon i feel like i get it mixed together better and there it is so i set the cookies to chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes while you're doing this it's good to preheat your oven to 350 fahrenheit put a little parchment paper on a baking sheet or you can just grease it with some butter or like spray on pam i just prefer parchment paper and then you see me rolling the cookies again i like to use my hands for this but you can use two spoons and you're coating them in just granulated sugar and i like to do like tablespoon size maybe ping pong ball golf ball sized little balls and they're perfect all right and after about 10 minutes in the oven maybe eight maybe 12 you get these beautiful looking cookies it makes about three dozen maybe more maybe less but they are beautiful i hope you enjoyed my how to video on fall cookies these are ginger molasses my favorite cookie um i really like dipping them in milk but they're also really good in the morning with some coffee but let's give it a shot it's delicious", "kTqMYHMoGDI": "hello fellow Baker babies you're watching LaVon Baker I'm LaVon Baker and today we're gonna get in the festive spirit we're going to be making gingerbread cookies they're gonna be so yummy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] first thing that we need to do is turn on our ovens so I've got mine preheating to 180 degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit I've got a baking tray here which I've lined with some parchment paper and the other thing we need to do is throw on the kettle and get it boiling because we're gonna have a cup of tea these are the ingredients that we're going to need for our cookies today all right so we've got some butter and brown sugar I've also got some golden syrup we're going to be using this egg yolk over here and then we've got some spices so over here I've got ground cinnamon ground nutmeg ground cloves and ground ginger in here I've got some all-purpose flour or plain flour and I've got a tiny bit of self-raising flour and I've also got a little bicarb soda what we need to do is we need to melt down our butter our sugar and our syrup so I'm going to put them on the stove into a saucepan and we'll go on to a low heat and I'll just let that I have slowly all melt and then once it's melted down we'll take it off the stovetop put it in a bowl and let it cool okay so I'm just gonna give this a stir mix it all in for a couple of minutes and we're just gonna keep stirring until all the butters melted and all of the mixture is nice and smooth so you can see it's already starting to melt down really quickly reminds me of Pooh bear's honeypot Baker's priviledged your dip and taste all the sugar the next thing that we need to do is to separate our eggs so we're just going to be using the yolk for this so what I do to separate the eggs is to grab two bowls and then what we do is crack the egg and I actually use the shell and I rotate it from side to side and let the egg white drip into One Bowl and then you should be left with the yolk and we'll drop it into the other bowl so let's give it a go crack the egg turn him upside down use the shell crack him in half let the egg white drip out and keep rotating the yolk between the shells and that looks pretty good keep going a little bit more excellent so now we're just left with the egg yolk and I'm gonna drop him in here and we'll use this one perfect [Music] on to our dry ingredients so what we're gonna do here is put all of the flowers and soda and spices into a bigger bowl give it a whisk and then we'll be ready to start combining everything in goes the flour and Endel the spices who don't smell it too much now let's give it a whisk [Music] the smells coming from the dry mix here are so fragrant it just smells like Christmas all those beautiful spices mixing together these little cookies they're gonna be delicious before we put everything together I'm just gonna let our little pot here that we did with the butter and the sugars and the syrup cool just a little tiny bit longer and in the mean time great opportunity to have our cup of tea I'm fresh out of loose leaf tea today so I've gone with a tea bag I decided to stick with the festive spirit and it's called Christmas breakfast in this tea it's got ginger cinnamon vanilla nutmeg and it's a black tea so I think it'll be delicious with our cookies now is the fun part we get to combine all of the ingredients give it a good stir and create our dough I'm gonna create a little will because I like that and drop it on greedy's and go is the beautiful yoke nice and I'll give that a little mix okay and then in goes our wet [Music] get every last bit [Music] looking good but I think it's time start tacking this with my hands clean here so I'm just kneading the dough here flattening it rolling it pressing it okay so I've been eating my dough for at least five minutes so you want to keep kneading it and working it until it becomes into a nice sticky round ball dough just like this so originally it was quite dry just because it is the shortbread and it just needs a bit of extra work and extra love from your arms so we can get it to the right sort of dough that we want it to be to start cutting them out into our little cookie cutter shapes next we need to prepare our workspace so I'm going to sprinkle my bench here with some flour and we're going to start rolling out our dough [Music] grab your dough chuck them in the middle and let's start rolling so I find its easiest to start rolling from the center and then make your way around the circle okay so I'm just rolling out the dough here and it's about one centimeter in thickness and what I've done is just started my way from the center working it all the way around and that looks like it's pretty good to go we can start cutting our cookie I don't have your traditional gingerbread man cookie cutter today but I do have this cute little snowflake which my mama bought me thanks mom and we're going to use this today for our gingerbread cookies okay cut your cookies so we'll just make our way around the dough and then once we've got our first round of cookies cut we will rework the dough into a ball again roll it out and start cutting some more cookies we don't want to waste any of the dough so even though we're cutting in two sections of it now we're going to use all of it [Music] so I'm gonna grab all the bits of my dough and rework it into a nice circle again and start kneading it and then we'll cut some more cookies okay so we're gonna go again for round two I have reworked my cookie dough I gave it a very light sprinkle of water and I've replaced down my flour here and I've got my dough into a disc and I'm gonna start rolling it out and I'll cut the next round of cookies now let's go for round three so I've made about fifteen fifteen to sixteen cookies [Music] now that all the hard work and kneading is done let's get these little babies into the oven [Music] now it depends on your oven but I'm gonna check mine after 10 minutes they should be done by then but just monitor yours and take them out until they're nice and lightly brown and they look like they're ready to devour yeah these look so good so I brought mine oh the oven after 9 minutes they were nice and golden-brown so just keep monitoring yours as well and now while they're nice and warm I'm gonna have mine with my tea so these are good to eat as they are they'll be absolutely delicious and they smell like Christmas they're going to taste like Christmas but if you are so inclined we can also decorate these a little bit further I actually found some designer icing in the supermarket so once these cooled down a bit we'll decorate a couple and they'll be even more festive looking now we get to eat it [Music] mmm oh my gosh he's a crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle they are such a good gingerbread cookie you can do them in any shape that you like you've got Christmas trees you can do the traditional gingerbread man you can do some no flakes like what I've done just get in the kitchen and have some fun it's Christmas and let's get in the festive spirit so if you want to add a tiny bit extra to these cookies to make them super super cute I've got some designer icing here which I've just found in the supermarket and I've just tried out my first one there but you can do any design that you like these are so much fun to have a play with especially if you're in the kitchen with your family or some little ones make sure they get involved as well folks you look like these little guys huh thank you so much for baking these gorgeous little gingerbread cookies with me today I hope that they serve you well over the Christmas period and you have a lot of fun in the kitchen with your family

"hJWwpG6s_IA": "hi everybody it's get real in the kitchen with diana olson and i had molasses left over from that salmon marinade so what else but molasses cookies so molasses has been around a long time at least six since 600 bc for you history buffs and uh what a popular cookie it has it was until the price of white sugar went down first part of the 1900s and then they switched to to sugar so that doesn't make take away from the deliciousness of a molasses cookie and what is interesting about this and different for this recipe is that instead i i put in half almond flour and half of the flour so it gives you a little bit of protein and i have a nice interesting spice mix for you in there and um some vanilla so after i mix them up it was just you incorporate the uh wet ingredients and i i mix those with a mixer and then i uh measured out the dry ingredients and then i just mixed them together so it does this does work better if you have a cookie scoop and to make it easier i sprayed it uh it for the cookie so the batter will come out more easily so let's put that last cookie on well you know it's not so easy for the last cookie because it's a little bit stiff and it's just got too much in there but it went fast so i'm going to pop these in the oven and always remember to set that timer and you're going to take them out when you touch them with the imprint and it doesn't leave an imprint you you touch the cookie so it was about nine minutes with my oven and um you don't want to put them too close together um so they they need room to spread out so this for this first cookie that came out let that uh set up to rest and by the way it does and this is another thing i can recommend is a cookie turner they nice and thin those those are helpful so let's try this out let me tell you good with the beverage of your choice milk tea whatever don't make this a solo mission grab someone whip up some molasses cookies the recipes below in the description and don't forget to subscribe and remember this is live one take from denver see you next time", "XDl2ICm1ebA": "hey what's up everybody it's 3:30 in the morning and we're baking cookies molasses cookies and I wanted to make something that was a little more healthier and had a lower glycemic because I have been really watching what I eat to be honest so these cookies are made with blackstrap molasses which is super duper fantastic it is the least refined of the sugar cane syrups and it is chock full of minerals like selenium thiamine has vitamin b6 in that it's just overall great for you I'm also using a vegan cold-pressed butter for this recipe but you can substitute it for either applesauce if you're watching your fat intake or coconut oil is which is one of my favorites but I just don't have any on hand right now I am also using raw sugar you can also use coconut sugar or Muscovado sugar as well which is like a healthier both of them are healthier versions of brown sugar yeah that's the recipe we're going with today so this recipe is pretty straightforward and I will leave links in the description below for all of you guys who would print this out and make them yourselves but it is the stereotypical cookie method which is combining all of your wet ingredients and then adding your dry ingredients and folding them in and then we will be rolling them into little balls and then rolling them into raw sugar and beating them in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 22 minutes so we're gonna add everything in our mixing bowl we have our raw sugar our blackstrap molasses and our melted vegan butter then we're gonna mix that together and I'm using whole wheat flour but you can use all-purpose flour if you want for this recipe and then adding in some warming spices I just used cinnamon and allspice but you can use ginger or anything that you have on hand some sea salt a little vanilla extract and a very important ingredient baking soda so after ingredients are combined our dough will be a bit firm but slightly sticky and we will roll them into a little bit smaller than golf ball sized balls and then roll them in sugar and then like I said bake them in the oven and yeah so they're pretty fantastic so I just wanted to eat something that was a little healthier it's still a cookie it's still gonna have sugar and fat and all that good stuff but I just these days I've been really in control of what I put into my body so if I really want a cookie I can just make a healthier version myself and just enjoy it okay so now we're gonna taste test I got the ugly one because I'm saving the pretty ones for a photo shoot tomorrow [Music] they're so good I know this is gonna sound crazy to some of you and some of you are gonna get me but I am really weird about textures and I guess it's a sensory being I don't know but I love the feeling of having like this delicately crisp exterior of a cookie and then it just being so super soft and chewing the middle just like I guess that's a ASMR that's where all the kids are doing these days yeah  eight somewhere molasses cookies we'll just go with that so anyways you guys I hope you enjoyed this quick recipe tonight and I want to know what you're making what kind of food do you make it 3 a.m. because I know there are some of you guys who are out there that do baking at 3 o'clock in the morning and I want to know those people till next time I will talk to you guys later please like subscribe share do all that great stuff and help build this awesome little community I will see you next video bye [Music]", "qrJtcKooK_w": "Adaline what's your favorite thing about the what's your favorite thing oh well then you're gonna be in love today we're gonna make molasses cookies and we're gonna show you how to do - okay so so in this bowl we have our two hundred quarter cups of all-purpose flour we're gonna mix to it thank you so we're gonna need a teaspoon of baking soda sure can speaking so that has a nice box top flat you scoop up some of the white powder and then scrape it up against the top edge of the box the next thing we need is a quarter teaspoon of salt go ahead and hold it right over the ball and salt is important in a dish even if it's not a salty dish so ground cinnamon and in here we need one and a half teaspoons now we're gonna do one and a half teaspoons of ground ginger doesn't it good like it's gonna make these cookies just a little bit spicy but not like salsa spicy it's gonna be like it's not gonna be too spicy day ya know and the reason we put a little bit of spice in but then we put sugar and the sugar helps kind of tone down the spiciness the next thing we're gonna do is ground cloves and we need 1/2 a teaspoon of ground cloves and they smell like kind of smell like cookies this is the this is what gives it's pretty strong this is what gives these molasses cookies their smell all right so now next we need our nutmeg and I'm gonna set this aside ok yeah we're gonna ground up our own so right here what we have this is a nutmeg nut so this microplane has a little tiny knives on it little tiny shreds off of this thing ok what she's doing here she doesn't excite us but it's nutmeg dust so I'm gonna just cook this up in my quarter teaspoon I think that's it for our dry ingredients make sure it stays down in there as a common mistake that kids make is they stick it in and then they pull it up and flip it in the air and when we have flour going every okay the next step for this recipe now that we finished our dry ingredients is to mix up our wet ingredients we're gonna be using our stand mixer so this paddle attachment is good for what's called creaming we're gonna be mixing the butter and the sugars together and creaming them together and what's gonna happen is the sugars are kind of kind of like sand and they're gonna get rubbed into the butter and they're gonna unwrap them into that dish a cup of brown sugar next we need 1/2 a cup of white granulated sugar and then scoop that up alright go ahead and dump that in a delayed and close up your mixer up now if you see what's happening is the butter is getting pushed into the sugar looking like you know we need to do we need to turn it up high let's just put it to six to the side of the bowl we're gonna keep doing this until it turns light colored so it's going to be fluffy and it's gonna be whiter and we're gonna let it go for about three to six minutes it's been running for about a minute and a half or two minutes and we're gonna scrape down the sides scoop all this right down to the middle again soaking and if you want if you have a kid the kid can pop me like yeah but don't eat the whole thing just let them eat the stuff off of this and one time we luck torn it ah scrape it down one more time alright times up and it is definitely looking lighter and fluffier isn't it so go ahead and open the top here and I'm gonna scrape it down one more time okay the next few ingredients we need to put into this is going to be an egg yolk the yellow part I'm gonna do is you're gonna put your fingers right here we're gonna crack the egg right on your hand and what you're gonna want to do is get the waste to slip through your fingers but keep the yolk make sure you don't break the yolk just wiggle it around until all the weights fall through your fingers go ahead and plop the egg yolk right into our mixing bowl over there Wow we need a teaspoon so we've put the egg molasses and vanilla in here we just need to go ahead and close it up let's start it real slow so it doesn't make a big mess so just go ahead and do to stir yep I'm just kind of trying to break up the egg a little bit and go ahead and speed it up now let's go to tune okay now that it's combined it does yeah it's no big molasses sign alright so now we can start mixing our wet ingredients with our dry ingredients and we already have our wet ingredients in the bowl and I'll scrape down Kalin if you want to go ahead and put it to stir now I'm going to slowly start scooping this in here go ahead Adelaide slowly and let it mix in I think that looks pretty well combined you can go ahead and turn that off Colin so this is now our cookie dough you see that it's kind of it's thick it's really kind of almost like a soft play-doh and this is a number 40 Disher which is just a little smaller than two tablespoons purple is usually the one that's the number forty so this is a I'm just gonna scoop up here have it be mounted just a little bit about that size right there and what I'm gonna do is pop this right into Adalind's hand and she's going to roll this into a nice smooth ball now you don't have to touch it too much just make sure it gets into a ball shape that looks pretty good and then pop it into the sugar out of it and then when you're gonna pick up some sugar and just sprinkle it on top and then and then roll it around and then once he I think the whole thing is covered in sugar just set it right in the corner of your pan well could probably get two pans worth of cookies here who likes getting their hands messy 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 okay so we have made two sheet pans of cookies how many are they gotta leave time there's 20 cookies I want them to be about two inches apart and so cuz they're gonna spread out as they cook yeah you're right that was a good time to wash hands huh which we do because we got molasses cookie all over our hands so our oven is at 375 degrees our hands are clean and we're ready to put these in the oven we want these cookies to be soft and chewy right so we don't want to have them completely cooked so we're just gonna put them in for about eleven or twelve minutes and they're going to they're gonna look like they're not totally done but we'll we'll show you guys what it looks like when they come so first half the pan is very hot so do not touch it the other thing you see is the top some cookies so these actually need to keep cook so the hot pan is we're gonna leave these on the pans for 10 minutes okay all right how do they look kids oh you still see that there's some sugar on top that's gonna make it nice and crispy in there I love it they get all cracked open like that so we let these cool a little bit there's still a little bit warm right now but I'm gonna go out and pick

this is the point where they just don't listen the original recipe I found said to use white granulated sugar but we tried it with brown sugar and it turned out great so we didn't want to mess with a cup or faction melted butter so we use brown sugar you put the egg in there too one egg yeah two cups of flour now right here I kind of messed up my hitter told him to add the molasses before he had at the flower but it worked out we got them glasses in there two teaspoons of baking soda all I was the bus going with the blues yeah quarter quarter cup of molasses ladies listen are you doing a little over half of that yeah buzzer you quarters are then no third of a cup would I don't think they have a measurement for less than a quarter I don't know three quarters of the quarter of a test with the Viking tablespoons I guess okay now 2 teaspoons of baking soda yeah one under the little mysteries about getting over there just one can't see what it says on the measuring spoons without your reading glasses okay now half a teaspoon of salt or less one teaspoon of cinnamon [Music] a half a teaspoon of cloves ginger cloves and ginger excuse me half teaspoon that's the next one if you don't have these three spices pumpkin pie spice works really well as a substitution you just add in 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and that'll take care of all three of the spices well that's it scrape down the sides now you put it in the fridge for an hour says a little walnut they say mm-hmm you roll it around in the sugar page it on the parchment paper how's that all brown sugar that your role as a half hour and a half late and we're preheating the oven to 350 I'll see you a little bit of cinnamon in this trigger and mash cookies down every bar did you do the others this way or is this just something notices with the glasses notice his fancy design no I don't think I did you put him in the oven is preheated ivamos go ahead make cookie balls Evans warmed up and put them in the oven for you yeah we have around 14 minutes I don't know it says eight to ten neighborhood well the recipe i was using set eight to ten minutes but our oven must be much cooler so you'll have to adjust the baking time finn suit your own office way to make cookies a ways by the smell our dog always likes to be on hand anytime there's cooking involved bonnie bonnie always gets hungry when she smells us cooking so I gave her some hamburger that I had the fried up for her ahead of time I've seen and read so much about and dog food recently that I stopped eating it to my dog we have a local grocery store that sells 10 pound bags of chicken thighs for fifty cents a pound so I've been getting that and feeding that to my dogs and they love it buh-bum both lost them on the floor I mix it up with other thing and a little rice and and eggs and vegetables to give them a more balanced diet but they seem to be thriving on it our chihuahua is somewhat finicky eater and she's been gaining some weight in her fur has come in really nice and silky so I think it's a good thing to do one new settlement I'm said it would you set it out originally yeah 12 well I said it as well 15 yeah well will

Gingersnaps are a richly spiced, crisp cookie that comes together so quickly with no chill time. Hey, you're watching \"Preppy Kitchen,\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These gingersnaps will be ready in a snap. So let's get started. We're gonna sift two and\na half cups or 300 grams of all purpose flour into a large bowl. I'm using a scale but if\nyou're using measuring cups, just sprinkle the flour\nin and level it off. Do not pack that flour in. That's a recipe for disaster. For leavening, we're adding two teaspoons of baking soda, so one and two. In you go. Three quarters of a teaspoon of salt. It'll give a nice\nbalance to these cookies. And then it's time for the spices. One teaspoon of cinnamon. That is always a must\nfor any holiday baking. And add two teaspoons of ground ginger. You get a lot of bite on these cookies. 1/2 a teaspoon of clove. This is a really, really\npowerful spice and if you're not a fan, I get it. Why don't you use 1/2 a\nteaspoon of allspice instead. Now cardamom, it makes a big difference but you could totally skip\nit if it's not for you. Sift it out. Look at these clumps. See these clumps? You don't want those clumps. Our scale is done. Thank you very much. Whisk it up and set it aside. It's time for our butter,\nsugar, and molasses. Into the bowl of my stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, I'm adding three quarters of a cup of unsalted room temperature butter as well as the secret ingredient\nfor this cookie, molasses. If you like the smell of molasses, let me know in the comments. I find it horrific but\nit does magical things in baked goods like cookies. It'll add a lot of depth of flavor. So one quarter of a cup. It looks cool but it looks kind of like something that a villain in a horror movie would use. Look at that. Bah. Okay, get it all out and to that, we're gonna be adding three quarters of a cup of brown sugar. This adds a lot of caramel flavor as well. And in case you didn't know, brown sugar is just regular\nsugar mixed with molasses. (chuckling) It's not like some special, magical sugar. So we're adding even more\nof the molasses flavor by using brown sugar. Cream it up until it's nice,\nlight, fluffy, and yes, you probably have to scrape the bowl down. (mixer whirring) Let's take a look. This is a beautiful color and\nthis is the perfect cookie for your holiday platter. When we put our decorations up and I have a big cookie spread out, this is gonna be one of the stars. Although I do have\nseveral holiday favorites, so I dunno. Do I even have a favorite\nif I have several? How does that work? All right, now it's time to add in\none room temperature egg, large if you can, and mix it up. While that's going, add two teaspoons of a nice vanilla. Now is when you wanna\nscrape that bowl down. You could just keep mixing\nwhen you add the flour in, but you want these\ncookies to not be tough. Even if they're crisp, they're not gonna be\ntough because the gluten in the flour will not be activated because we will not be over mixing. It's a lot of negatives but\nit adds up to a positive. It's time to dump the flour in. In you go. And if you watch this channel, you know I'm a fan of pre-mixing. So just fold in the flour\nto your wet ingredients. It means less mixing, less flour explosions. I hate that. Now mix on low until just combined. It's almost combined. And it just combined. If there is a little bit\nof flour hanging out, you can just use your spatula\nand finish it off by hand. Just take a look in the bowl. I can see at the very\nbottom there's a whole bunch of this powdery flour nonsense, so I'm gonna work it in. The doughs all come together and there is no chill\ntime for this recipe. So your oven should be set\nand heated to 350 already. I'll add a caret about that at the very beginning of this video 'cause I didn't mention that. But we're gonna put this\non to our baking sheet and pop them into the oven. It's as quick as that. I'm gonna scoop all my dough out first then roll it in my clean hands and finally roll it in some sanding sugar. The sanding sugar is optional. You could use regular granulated sugar. You could use cinnamon sugar. The nice thing is that\nyou're gonna get a little bit of crunch and sparkle on the cookie and it's like a nice, nice finishing touch. Okay, they're scooped out. Roll 'em up. Doesn't have to be perfect but it's nice to get kind\nof a more cohesive shape with less nooks and crannies. When you pick up the balls of dough, you'll feel if one is a\nbit heavier than the others and you can just pinch off a little bit of dough and use it on another cookie. So unlike a shortbread cookie or my no-spread sugar cookie recipe, these will spread out and\nyou just wanna make sure to give them a little\nbit of room in between. I would say around two inches. This is holiday magic already. And just like a Russian tea cake, these are not jaw-wrenchingly\nsweet cookies. We only used three\nquarters of a cup of sugar for three cups of flour. So the extra bit of sugar on the edge will give you a little bit\nof that initial sweetness which is really pleasant in a cookie. If you want your gingersnaps\nreally flat and crisp, go ahead and gently press\ndown on those dough balls right before you pop them into the oven. They'll bake up a little\nflatter and be a little crisper. It's time for these cookies to go in to the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 12 to 13 minutes. The edge will be set and the center will be a little bit soft and continue to set after baking. My gingersnaps are out of the oven and cool enough to touch. I'm gonna take a bite. But before I do, if you like this video, check out my holiday cookie playlist. All of my holiday cookies\nin one playlist for you. And now it's time for a bite. Look at this. Ah. (chuckling) It kinda exploded. It's just screaming holidays. I can see the trees with\nsnow and all the ornaments in my mind eating this cookie. I really hope you get a\nchance to make this recipe.

Hey everyone, Sam here and today I'm sharing a recipe\nfor crisp, snappy, gingersnap cookies. Now I will also be sharing a soft and\nchewy version, but today we're sticking with a classic hard and snappy cookie.\nNow to get started you'll want to pre-heat your oven to 315, that's\nthree, one, five degrees Fahrenheit. Next, the first ingredient you're going\nto need is seven tablespoons of unsalted butter and you want to go ahead and melt\nthis and then let it cool until it's no longer warm to the touch. Now we can add\nour sugar, vanilla, and spices. We're going to start with 1/2 cup of granulated\nsugar. 1/4 cup of firmly packed dark brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla\nextract. Now we'll add our spices, and these gingersnap cookies use a lot of spices. They're all important for that perfect gingersnap flavor. perfect gingersnap flavor. We'll start with 2 and 1/4 teaspoons of ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. And then just about 1/16\nteaspoon of ground black pepper. Now the cayenne pepper and the ground black\npepper might seem like unusual cookie ingredients, but they're actually pretty\ncommon in Gingersnaps. They add a nice heat to the cookie that you're probably\nused to if you've ever eaten Gingersnaps before. You'll feel it on the back\nof your tongue after you bite into the cookie. Now you'll want to stir all of\nthese ingredients together until they're well combined. I like to add our spices\nhere with the wet ingredients and the melted butter, rather than with the dry\ningredients and the flour, because I feel like it really helps to infuse the\nflavor through the whole cookie. That melted butter really does a good job of\nhelping to meld those flavors. Now we'll add our molasses and you will need 2\ntablespoons of molasses for this recipe. We'll make sure to stir this molasses\ninto our other ingredients until it's nicely combined. And now we'll also add 2 tablespoons of milk and 1 large egg yolk. Now set your wet ingredients aside and\nyou're going to need a separate bowl for your dry ingredients. We're going to\nstart with 1 and 2/3 cups of all-purpose flour. Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda,\nand 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and we'll just whisk these together until they're\nnicely combined. Now gradually stir your dry ingredients into your wet\ningredients until completely combined and you have a nice cookie dough. Once you have everything mixed together\nwe can go ahead and portion out our cookie dough, and bake our Gingersnap\ncookies. Now I like to portion the dough by about 2 teaspoons of dough per cookie.\nYou want to keep them pretty small that way they cook evenly all\nthe way through and they get nice and crisp in the oven without having to wait\nforever for them to finish baking. These cookies are already going to be cooking\nfor a longer amount of time than your standard cookie. So keeping them small\njust cuts down on that time a little bit. Now I always roll the dough between my\npalms to form a nice little ball, and then I also like to roll this in\ngranulated sugar. The dough will be a little bit sticky but it shouldn't be\nunmanageably so. If your cookies get too misshapen while you're rolling them\nthrough the sugar; once they're nicely coated in granulated sugar, it might\nhelp to then try to roll them again. The sugar will help keep them from sticking\nto your hands and it'll give them a nice round shape. Alright let's take these\nover to our 315 degree Fahrenheit preheated oven where they will need to\nbake for about 20 to 22 minutes. Once your cookies are finished baking you'll\nwant to take a clean glass with a flat bottom, and I like to just gently or\nactually rather firmly press down on each cookie to help flatten it even\nfurther. You'll want to make sure that you do\nthis within one to two minutes of the cookies coming out of the oven. If you\nwait any longer than that they're really not going to give any when you press\ninto them. Now I've found that pressing into the cookies in this way helps make\nthem even more crisp once they're cooled. Now after your cookies have finished\nbaking you do not want to touch them or enjoy them until they have cooled\ncompletely. They're still going to be pretty soft when they're warm so let\nthem cool completely so they'll be nice and crisp when they're finished. Once\nyour cookies have cooled completely they should be nice and crisp and brittle,\njust like a gingersnap should be. And that is how you make crisp, snappy, Gingersnaps at home. Completely from scratch. I hope you guys enjoyed today's recipe and\nif you try this one out please let me know what you think and be sure to watch\nfor my soft and chewy version that will be coming soon. Alright thank you so\nmuch for watching and I will see you next time. You hear that crunch? These are good.", "xLqd-AWhVpo": "hi I'm Stephanie drawer ski of joy baking calm today we're going to make gingerbread men this is a really popular cookie for the holiday season and it's really fun to make it with the kids so we're going to start by making the dough for the dry ingredients in a large bowl place three cups that's 390 grams of white all-purpose flour you may know that as plain flour and to that I'm going to add 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and I like to use the kosher salt here and then we're going to add a lot of like really warm spices that we always think of when we think of Gingerbread 2 teaspoons of ground ginger 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon quarter of a teaspoon of ground cloves and a quarter of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg now you could really vary these spices I mean if you don't like nutmeg or you could leave that out or put less in but this is a good mix to start with so I'm just going to whisk or you could sift all this together you just want to make sure that the baking soda and all the spices are mixed into the flour ok and then if you have a stand mixer like I do just use your paddle attachment or you could just use a hand mixer for this you will start with a half a cup of butter which is 113 grams and have it at room temperature I like to use the unsalted butter if you're using salted butter I might cut back a little on that salt that you added with the flour so I'm just gonna beat this until it's soft and they're nice and creamy and smooth okay scrape down as you need to and next we need a half a cup which is 100 grams of granulated white sugar just sweeten it up a bit and I'm gonna beat this medium medium-high speed until it's light and fluffy a couple minutes okay so just scrape down your sides and then we're going to add one large egg and have that at room temperature and I'm just going to beat that in and our next ingredient is molasses we're going to add 2/3 of a cup which is 160 milliliters of molasses first when you measure out molasses this is a good idea to just spray the inside of your cup first with one of those nonstick sprays because then that way it doesn't stick to the sides it's easy comes out easily and I'm using a light molasses it's a more milder flavor than the dark molasses and I like to use unsalted grandma's this is a very popular brand and it's very good so just keep that in mind what you're looking for because there's lots of choices of different types sulfur done salt for light dark and of course if you like a a stronger flavor to your gingerbread you could go and ahead and use a darker molasses yeah I'm just going to beat that in okay and now I'm just going to add the flour I'm gonna add that in a couple additions because there's so much flour and you don't want that flying up in your face so just adding you know maybe a third of it beat that in and then add the rest a little more really smell the molasses and all those wonderful spices okay now I'm just going to add the rest of the flour okay and that's it it's a fairly simple dough to mix up now we're going to we need to chill this dough because we're going to roll it out so you want it quite firm so it doesn't stick to the counter and then you want the cookies to keep their shape and their bake so it has to but the dough does have to be chilled okay so I'm stuck here on the counter okay it's kind of gathered into a ball and just roughly cut it in half take a piece of plastic wrap put it in the center just kind of make a round that up it's easier if we roll out the dough in smaller sections it's a lot of dough to roll out in one big circle so it's easier if we divide it up mm-hmm and then into the fridge this will take several hours or you could even chill it overnight in the fridge okay our dough has now been chilled until firm so we need to roll it out so just gonna need some flour flour your surface pretty well so you don't want the gingerbread dough to stick and then flour your rolling pin and we're gonna roll this out to about a quarter of an inch which old what a half a centimeter and just keep lifting and if you need to add more flour it's lift and turn you want to do that so it doesn't stick if you just left it here and just kept rolling it would probably stick to the counter and then when you cut out the cookies it's a real mess trying to get lift them onto the your baking sheet now you will need a couple baking sheets and you can line them with parchment paper or you can just butter them or lightly spray them with the nonstick spray and of course you need a cookie cutter we're making gingerbread men but really this is a nice seasonal dough for the Fall you could for Halloween you can make pumpkins or you know ghosts you can do that I mean you could also use it for Christmas do all kinds of Christmas ornament shapes but we're gonna do the classic gingerbread man kids seem to love that at least my kids did or and still do okay so once you've got a rolled out and I'm just checking make sure it's not sticking then I'm going to I got my classic gingerbread man you can get metal you can get plastic cutters like this whatever you have and I like lightly flour it and then press down and then if you have a lot of flour on the bottom you just take a pastry brush and lightly brush off that extra flour and then just place it on your baking sheet now we want to space them a couple inches apart about five centimeters just in case they spread just keep cutting so as you can see I have I'm making big gingerbread man so I can only fit six on my baking sheet now if you wanted to we're going to decorate these after with a with frosting if you wanted to use raisins for eyes and all that your current you could put those on now if you wanted you could use these as a gift tag or even as ornaments so what you need if you want to do that is to take like a little round hole I'm just using the end of one of these tips and just put it in the top like so then you get a little ring and that way you can loop it like a ribbon or something after you're finished decorating them so what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover these and put them in the fridge what we don't want is when they go in the oven for the gingerbread man to lose their shape because if if the dough has become soft they will spread which we don't want to do so if you put them in the fridge for about ten minutes that'll firm that up so you won't have that problem so while I'd put these in the oven or sorry in the fridge pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is a hundred and eighty degrees Celsius so now our gingerbread men have chilled a little and they're ready to be baked so as you can see what I did while I was chilling these is gather up the scraps and rolled out smart gingerbread man I'm going to place those in the refrigerator while these are baking so we want to bake these depending on the size of your gingerbread man anywhere between say eight and twelve minutes what you want is them to be firm and just starting to brown oh just barely tinged with brown around the outside edges okay our gingerbread men are now done as you can see they're barely tinged with brown around the outside edge now keep in mind that the longer you bake these the more crisp and crunchy they will become this gives you a really quite soft gingerbread so if you preferred like a little more crispy then just bake them a little longer so um leave them rate like this for a couple minutes until the gingerbread man firm up a little and then just use a spatula and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely and then just continue to bake the rest of your cookies and then once everything's cool we will make the frosting so now we're going to make a basic buttercream frosting to pipe on our gingerbread men so if you have a stand mixer use a paddle attachment for this or you can just use a hand mixer and start with a half a cup of butter which is about 113 grams and have that at room temperature and I like to cut it up into just large chunks cuz then it'll be a lot easier so I'm just going to beat this just until it's nice and creamy and smooth okay and you will need two cups which is about 230 grams of confectioner sugar or you may know that is powdered or icing sugar and sift that because the icing sugar tends to have a lot of lumps and we don't want that we want to frosting be nice and smooth so I'm going to add this I think in a couple not all at once maybe half and start it low speed it at low speeds you just want to get it all mixed in we don't want that sure to come up in her face we're gonna add the rest of the sugar sweep that in slowly so now I'm going to add one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract just to give it a little bit of a flavor now if you didn't want to flavor your frosting with vanilla you could use like an orange extract would be very nice or a lemon with the ginger flavor gingerbread flavor that would be nice and then along with one and a half tablespoons of either a light cream or even a milk and then I'm gonna beat this some fairly low speed just until it's all mixed together and then increase your speed to medium medium-high and beefer three four minutes just until it's really light and fluffy and a piping consistency okay so we're done so this is what you're looking for just a nice fairly thick kind of like whipping cream I guess you would say and what I always have on hand is a little extra icing sugar and a little extra milk just in case you have to kind of adil if it's too thin add a little sugar too thick add a little more milk just until you get it so you can pipe it easily and now I'm gonna leave the icing white if you want you could color if you would prefer that with different colors if you're having the kids help you then you might want to do all different colors and because they tend to like different things so I'm gonna use a piping bag you buy these disposable ones or you could just use a ziploc bag and just cut the end off and I'm just using fairly small plain tip and just fold back the bag and kind of just hold it and put in your icing if you use these disposable bags like this and put in different colors and let the kids have fun with it they seem to enjoy it and then you could have all kinds of different sprinkles or that they could use as well they tend to really like to put lots of sprinkles and then just press the icing down to the end you see it come out the bottom like so and then hold it and twist it because you want you want to get rid of any air pockets in your frosting and then really you can kind of do whatever you want here the one point I would make if you are doing going to do gift tags or hang these up on a tree and you've done this one with the whole I would bake them a little longer than normal because you want them quite crisp you don't want them kind of falling apart on you so then I'm just a simple thing is just to pipe eyes and a big smile and then we could type some buttons and then if you wanted to if you use a small enough playing tip you could go around the outside like this because I find kids like icing so they tend to want a little bit icing and every bite so it's just a basic way to do it have fun with it and you can let the icing dry and you can cover and store these for several days so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Jerry baking calm", "oGk0hdsN-ZU": "hey everyone and welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be us making some gingersnaps lush gingerbread cookies that are Kido and you can make them paleo if you want to use coconut sugar instead of like a keto sweetener but yeah let's just go ahead and get started and we're gonna try out this recipe and eat all the cookies later before we get started number one the full recipe is gonna be down below in the description box so you guys can check that out and I'm gonna go through some of the ingredients that we're using right now so that way you can make sure that you have everything in your kitchen before making this recipe so we're going to be using some almond flour I just get mine at Walmart they have like a huge bag now that's like $20 and I think it's like three or four pounds of almond flour so I always do that we're gonna be using some baking soda for keto we're gonna be using the brown sugar swerve this I also get at Walmart now and then if your paleo you could use coconut sugar and again I get this at Walmart and then I'm also using some coconut flour which this one I think I might have gotten from Walmart but now I actually saw that Aldi has some coconut flour so I haven't tried theirs yet but this is the Aldi brand and so I have it because that one's almost all gone and so I'm really excited to see cuz I think this was only like two dollars and of course we'll be using some butter I just get like grass-fed or pastured butter and then we'll be using some spices so ground ginger some ground nutmeg some cinnamon some vanilla extract and I'm gonna add some imitation maple flavor extract just to get that like darker brown color that's in gingersnap cookies so I'm gonna go ahead and put the butter in my bowl and we're going to melt it so that way we can add the rest of our ingredients into the bowl I also have my oven preheating at 350 degrees and I just have some sheet pans with my parchment paper okay so this is our melted butter and I'm going to be using the swerve brown sugar I'm going to use about a half a cup which you'll have to like press it down yeah just like that also going to add my maple extract almost a teaspoon and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract smells good we're gonna add one cup of almond flour and two tablespoons of coconut flour and then we're going to do half a teaspoon of baking soda pinch of salt and xanthan gum which you don't have to add but I like it a lot because it makes like a chewy consistency to my Kido baked goods so we're gonna do a quarter teaspoon of xanthan gum which I also get at Walmart okay then we're going to add our spices so we're going to do two teaspoons of ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg and a quarter teaspoon cinnamon stir this up and then we're gonna add our art egg now we're going to put them on our little baking sheets now I'm going to put them in the oven they look really good I can't wait to see how they turn out [Music] okay guys let's test one of these out they are soft so I only coached these buns for 10 minutes because I wanted them to still be like soft and everything so these aren't like Ginger Snaps they are like gingerbread but you could always cook them longer and make them like thinner if you actually want them to be Ginger Snaps but this looks absolutely delicious like look at that oh my gosh YUM let's see if I can get a close-up on here that looks so so good let's try my hopeful I want a mime focus ere we go wow these are really good if you like spicy gingery this is it if you don't really like a bunch of ginger then you might want to cut down on their ginger maybe just do one teaspoon but this is so good like they legit taste like ginger bread and they're really soft they're not too sweet at all I know I keep saying that but like these are really good and they're like really flaky to definitely have to make these like I said full recipe is down below in the description box hope that you enjoyed this video and I hope that you're looking forward to more of my 12 days of Christmas / QMS videos and I will see you guys in another one [Music]", "exSzo2XfuUQ": "[Music] okay so to start making our marenitos i am going to be using three and a half cups of all-purpose flour to that i will be adding one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of baking soda not to be cute confused with baking powder i'm just using baking soda one teaspoon i'm also going to add one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon a half teaspoon of ginger this is ground ginger powder and a quarter teaspoon of ground anise that is a nice seed that's been ground into a powder i will say that's optional uh if you don't have it but i like to add it so now i'm just going to give this a good mix okay that is combined well now let's work on the wet ingredients okay so here in a large bowl i am going to add a packed half cup of biloncio piloncio is basically um evaporated cane juice or sugarcane juice that's kind of you know evaporated and now it's in a solid form what i did was basically take uh my pilon seal and i shaved it with a knife on a cutting board and i packed it till i got a half cup measure you could also use dark brown sugar to that i am going to add one room temperature large egg three tablespoons of evaporated milk or whole milk i have two teaspoons of vanilla extract actually i think that's more like one and a half one and a half to two teaspoons i'm also going to add two tablespoons of softened unsalted butter or margarine if you have margarine at home soften it add two tablespoons now i'm going to add two-thirds cup of molasses this is really what gives the maranitos that brown that deep dark brown color now i'm going to give this a good mix okay so i'm actually experimenting with this recipe today i i do make maranitos but um i don't do it often actually i think it was like a year ago when i made them last so now i'm going to work in my dry ingredients kind of give it a mix and then add the rest and just mix and fold until it comes together okay so this is pretty much what the dough is going to end up like so now what i'm going to do is place this in cling film and rest for about two to three hours in my refrigerator okay so i have this on my cling film here my cling wrap by the way when you're making this dough if you find that it's still too wet and too sticky to sort of come together like this add a tablespoon of flour at a time until it comes together basically this is what you're looking for and because it has that molasses in it it is a sticky dough so um i'm going to refrigerate this just like this there we go going in the refrigerator two to three hours okay so this has been in the fridge for about two hours so what i'm going to do is flour generously flour my work surface and go ahead and put the dough out onto the floured surface and because the ratio of the ingredients this is a sticky cookie dough it can handle the excess flour so let's do that i'm also going to do the top okay i'm gonna dust my rolling pin and start rolling this out um you could do a quarter of an inch i'm actually gonna do something like a third of an inch okay so i've got my cookie dough rolled out so i have a little excess flour here and i'm just going to dredge it in some of the flour and this is a five inch cookie press or cookie cutter and it's in the shape of a little maranito a little piggy and they have some that are actually larger you have that that works so now i'm going to press right onto the cookie you know right here and then just press straight down and i'm just going to repeat that until i get several little okay so now i'm going to carefully and gently oops take my little maranitos and lay them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper there we go just like that okay so i have my uh cut out cookies on my baking sheet so now what i'm going to do well what i've done is i've beaten one large egg and i'm going to egg wash the tops of these cookies and at this point you'll want to preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit and these are going to bake for somewhere between 13 to 15 minutes okay so these are ready for the oven going in okay so i basically just kind of smooshed the rest of the dough together and rolled it out again and i'm just going to press out the rest of the cookies and even if there's still dough left over what i like to do is just sort of pat it out into a round cookie and bake it if there's any extra okay so my cookies are done my little maranitos look perfect so i am actually going to transfer these from the baking sheet over to a cooling rack and i'm just going to let them set and cool okay so now i have all of my maranatos baked i have this was the first batch they're cooling on the rack they're actually probably cooled i can move those but here is the last patch and as you can see i had enough for a little baby piggy and the excess dough that just really couldn't shape i just put it into a round circular disk and that's that so you definitely can get at least 18 cookies 16 to 18 cookies out of this [Music] i hope you give this recipe a try i hope you like it and thanks for watching [Music] [Music] you", "JgVWxGb4fLw": "Hi everyone welcome back to my kitchen today we have a

this recipe so if you are an egg-free person you will be able to make this cookie if you are vegan just simply swap out the butter for vegan butter or margarine and Your be good to go what you're going, to need is one cup of butter softened to room temperature three cups of all-purpose flour one cup of molasses one cup of sugar 1/3 of a cup of dark rum or spiced rum and one tablespoon of water you can't substitute the rum so this is for flavor and all the alcohol is gonna burn off anyway when you bake it a teaspoon of Baking soda and then this is your spices i've got a teaspoon and a half of salt a teaspoon of ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon of ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg and 1/8 of a teaspoon of ground cloves the molasses needs to go into a larger vessel What you want to do is you want to mix your baking soda and your molasses together there's going To be a chemical reaction here you want this, to sit for 15 minutes until this molasses basically doubles inside our molasses and baking soda mixture has been sitting for 15 minutes and as you can see it indeed has doubled all right what we're gonna do now is we're going to cream our butter and sugar together okay that's creamed is light and fluffy i'm going to add in the rum we're gonna mix this up Now i have scrapers on my beater so you'll want? To stop if you don't have those and scrape it down i'm gonna add all of my spices and i'm also gonna add one third of the flour now i'm gonna add half of the molasses mix that in I'm going, to add half of the flour we have remaining mix it add the rest of the molasses and the remaining amount of flour and we're gonna blend that up and we'll have cookie dough And now you have cookie dough so what i'm gonna do now is i'm going, to put this in a different vessel and i'm going to refrigerate it for at least six hours overnight is best if you plan on making these cookies you're gonna want to make them the day before and Then the next day you'll want to set aside some time because these are gonna need to be rolled out and cut So i'll be back when it's time to roll everything out and make some joe frogger cookies all right my dough is chilled you're gonna need a three and a half inch round cutter now this one is three and 7/16 so you know As close as you can get if you don't have one a large? Cannon girl in a wide mouth canning jar lid actually might work really well let's see oh that's like perfect? yeah that would work as well we're gonna go ahead and get started and i'll be back and i'll show you what these look like when we're cutting them out all right what you want to do is roll out half of the dough to a quarter of an inch thickness or there abouts and Then you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna cut 12 circles you're gonna line two baking sheets and i'm mine are 13 by 18 they're a half sheet pan you're gonna line two of them with parchment paper and then you're gonna put six cookies On each cookie sheet you don't want to put more than that because these are gonna spread a little bit then you're gonna bake these for eight minutes at 375 And then you're gonna leave them on the pan for ten minutes to cool before you remove them To a wire rack so let's see if i can get twelve out of this i think i can Now i have baked off, some already so i'm just gonna reuse this piece of parchment these are going To spread a little bit i have a pan in the oven already so when these come out of the oven i'll bring you back and i'll show you what they look like there you have it joe froggers these take a little bit of time they take a little bit of patience but they're really easy to make overall and they are really delicious i just want to show you there nice and soft look at that they're soft and they're moist and they're spicy and they're perfect i think this is like the ultimate christmas cookie and i'm gonna share with you What these cookies are all about what they're little bit of history is and i'm gonna read it to you directly out of this is adapted from a recipe in this cook's country 2007 annual contributor brigid lancaster she's actually on this show and she talks about, how she went to a bakery in marblehead massachusetts and found this cookie and fell in love with it and in an attempt to Develop a similar cookie she found several recipes and she tried and she made some adjustments and she came up with this one she says the story goes that the author's tell the story of joseph brown a freed slave in revolutionary war veteran who lived in marblehead more than 200 years ago brown was known as old black joe and his wife lucretia affectionately known as aunt cressie opened up black joe's tavern in part of marblehead called gingerbread hill and besides serving drinks mostly rum joe and auntie cressie baked cookies large moist molasses and rum cookies made salty by the addition of marblehead seawater these cookies were popular sustenance on long fishing trip voyages as they, had no dairy to spoil and the combination of rum molasses and sea water kept them chewy for weeks According to samuel rhodes junior's history and traditions of marblehead the funny name for these cookies referred to the lily pads similar in size and shape to the cookies and large croaking frogs that would fill the pond behind joe's tavern Thus the cookies became known as. Joe froggers so i wanted to share that with you because nothing makes me happier than learning the history of a recipe because this recipe is over 200 years old and we get to eat it today in 2017 Just, the way that maybe aunt cressey made it in in all joe's tavern so i hope that you enjoyed this i also hope that You will take time to use the link down below and go to the playlist that i have created that includes all of the wonderful channels that are participating in this virtual cookie exchange please remember to check out heather at the needy homesteader She'll be at The queen's cabinet kymmie at she's in her apron jennifer at the family fudge valon at moss family tv danni and tina at phillips fambam jammer l at generals large family table and sarah at simply sarah's kitchen they have all contributed wonderful video recipes today to help you get ready for christmas and enjoy some delicious sweet treats along the way thank you for joining me i hope you enjoyed the video if you did please consider giving me a thumbs up if You are new to my kitchen welcome it's a pleasure, to have you here if you.

gingerbread cookies that's exactly what we're gonna make today gingerbread cookies warm and spiced and doughy and chewy chewy gingerbread cookies they are so easy to make and we're gonna start off by creaming together some butter which is softened down ever so slightly and we're going to cream it together with a combination of sugars I've got some granulated sugar and a little bit of dark brown sugar so straight on with the mixer let's get this mix light and fluffy the brilliant thing about these cookies is the minute you get them in the oven they start wafting that beautiful Christmas smell and instantly your transporter to Christmas heaven we're in business now so to this mixture we're going to add one large free-range egg so get that straight in there to this we're also going to give it a bit of a depth of sweetness from some treacle and if you can't get treacle which I know not everyone can you can use blackstrap molasses I think that's what it's called black molasses essentially a good tip if you're taking this out of the jar is to use a spoon with a little bit of oil on it and it'll ensure that you won't be left in the sticky mess I'm in right now I get rid of this now I'm going to leave him here I'm gonna mix this off okay we have a nicely mixed through and at this point now we need to talk about flavors and spices so to this mixture we're going to get in there with the dry ingredients but first things first we're going to add a tiny touch of vanilla extract we're also going to go in there with a heaped teaspoon of ground ginger just like this I like mine to be quite gingery but you can pull back if you don't want too much of that flavor we're also gonna add a heaped teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda or bread soda or baking soda whatever way you call it in your country and now we're going to give this a little mix through just to completely combine it okay nicely mix through and now it's time to get rid of your little what are these things called mixer speakers get rid of your beaters tap off any excess and now it's time to fold through our flour a little pinch of salt and some stem ginger for some flavor I liked a little bit of salt in there because it's the contrast between the sweetness and all that lovely saltiness so flour next so dump your flour straight in there and we're gonna fold this through until we have a nice cookie dough batter for a little bit of extra flavor now you don't have to use this if you can't get your hands on this but stem ginger it has this lovely little sweet sort of fiery flavor and if you get little chunks of this in your biscuits it is truly special this is coming together beautifully and now I have my beautiful gingerbread biscuit dough this is not your typical gingerbread dough because this one results in a beautiful chewy interior normally gingerbread is quite crisp and thin this one is all about thickness and chewiness so this goes to rest in the fridge and I have one that has been rested and that's ready to go it needs to rest in the fridge just so it has time for all that gluten in the flour to relax a little bit that cooling process in the fridge also helps that your cookies don't spread too much when they hit the heat in the oven so grab up a baking tray lined with some parchment paper and now it's just a case of taking up availa teaspoons amount of the dough rolling it in your hands like this take that little ball roll it in some granulated sugar and then once it is nicely coated like this place it on your baking tray and then just press it down ever so slightly with your phone and now I'm going to repeat with the remaining dough okay my last little dough ball is ready to go and I've pressed it down this narrow goes into the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius they're going to cook for about eight minutes they will spread ever so slightly but you're looking for a nice little bit of crackle effect and you're also looking for a nice firm exterior right oven time right my cookies have cooled they've come out of the oven they are ready to go and these now could be eaten just as they are they've got a lovely finish on them that lovely granulated sugar has given them a nice kind of rock crust on the outside and now I'm actually going to go the extra mile because it is Christmas we're gonna give these a nice gingerbread filling so to do that I have some softened butter and some icing sugar and this essentially is a very simple filling to make I'm gonna add a tiny touch of ginger I don't know if this oh it does fit I thought the spoon wasn't gonna fit so we're going to go about a half a teaspoon of ground ginger in here and all you got to do is beat this off until you have a nice smooth mixture okay we are in business I now have a nice smooth filling so I'm gonna get rid of the beaters we're gonna get them in the sink and now it is time to bring this together and to do that we're going to use a spatula to scrape down the side and essentially you're gonna want about a teaspoons amount to spread on the interior filling of all the biscuits so take one up give it a good spread with the filling you want to be too generous here because you don't want it to squeeze exercise just enough to bring it together and then choose one that's kind of similar size and you are left with a gingerbread cookie which is chewy moist oh so delicious with all that spice in there so now it is just a case of doing exactly the same with the remaining cookies okay that is all my cookies filled and now I get to taste one tastes like Christmas you've got all that spice in there mmm and it's that wonderful chewiness that you get from only these gingerbread cookies it's not like those crisp gingerbreads you've ever had before this is a chewy beautiful moist cookie that has that great filling in there as well so if you're looking for the recipe for these brilliant gingerbread cookies you'll find them in the box below

cancer research with bake sales and cookies so today I'm going to share with you my holiday cookie recipe hopefully inspire you to head over their site and learn how you can get involved these cookies are very simple and put together and we're gonna start with the dry ingredients so in my bowl here I've got some flour baking soda and salt and then I've got three spices got some ground ginger allspice and some cloves and we're just gonna whisk this together to combine the ingredients to get the wet ingredients going I've got four tablespoons or a half stick of unsalted butter in here and I'm going to add half a cup of sugar and I'm gonna cream this together alright so next I'm gonna add one egg white and then I'm gonna add 1/4 cup of blackstrap molasses blackstrap molasses is more flavorful more impotant than regular molasses but if you've got the regular one on hand to settle work as well so I'm just gonna whip this together until it's distributed all of our ingredients are ready to go so I'm going to add the spiced flour and we're gonna mix this together until the flour just disappears you don't want to over mix them or you'll start to develop gluten and the cookies will get tough now that our dough is done I'm gonna take this number forty one and a half tablespoon scoop and just pour some a little bit off roll it into a ball with my hands and then just skip it a little roll and a little bit of granulated sugar this just gives the cookie a nice little textural crunch on the outside my cookies are all shapes I'm going to throw these into a 350 degree oven for about 13 or 14 minutes after your cookies have finished baking let them cool completely and then you can actually store these in the freezer I eat these out of the freezer all the time I don't know apparently because I like frozen cookies so I just want to show you how to wrap these up nice and pretty so I have this plastic wrap here I just cut a square off from this big roll and you take all

"[Music] hello and welcome to home cooked history the show where we try to recreate historical dishes in today's casual kitchen my name is megan and i am a michelin star chef and james beard award recipient just kidding i'm actually not a professional chef as you can see because we are currently in my kitchen at home but i am a professional historian and today i am going to be presenting to you a favorite dessert of the 1930s and 1940s molasses cookies i feel like to say it right you have to say like molasses molasses cookies [Music] [Music] molasses was a part of americans daily diet in both the northern and southern colonies for instance in new england molasses was used for dishes like boston baked beans boston brown bread and indian pudding in pennsylvania molasses showed up in shoe fly pie and apple pan dowdy and in the south we see molasses jack and cormpone with molasses so we see widespread popularity of molasses throughout the south throughout the north and uh we also see its influence on regional cuisine throughout time so the recipe that we're using today was published in the washington times in 1920 it was part of an advertisement for brayer rabbit molasses which actually is the brand of molasses that we're going to be using today i'm not affiliated with rabbit molasses but the recipe calls for the cookies to be baked in a quote quick oven so there's no time specified or no temperature but a 1913 recipe for molasses cookies with similar ingredients calls for the oven to be about 350 degrees so go ahead and preheat your oven to 350. so what is molasses well it is actually the main byproduct that comes from the manufacturer of sugar from cane boiled down into a syrup like you do with maple sap in order to produce maple syrup the final product is actually referred to as black strap and it's not the same thing as sorghum despite some misconceptions about that the british refer to it as treacle and in japan it's actually called kurumitsu or black honey we're going to start by creaming our butter [Music] now we're going to add our molasses so a thing that i did not realize is that molasses does not smell very good so fun fat there are numerous historical recipes for molasses cookies and other molasses products in her first cookbook the apple door cookbook from 1872 miss parlova provided a recipe for molasses cookies which were originally a small cake form of gingerbread they have a lot of the same ingredients actually and later on in 1913 mrs lincoln who founded the boston cooking school published the school's first cookbook in 1884 and that included a recipe for soft molasses cookies as well in another version of that cookbook from 1896 fannie farmer included molasses drop cakes molasses cookies and soft molasses cookies so we see in a very short period of time different variations pop up of molasses cookies we are going to add a tablespoon of ginger and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix in many historic recipes uh molasses was used as the soul sweetener other recipes would mix molasses with white sugar or brown sugar and other variations included different mixes of spices so traditionally molasses cookies included ginger and cinnamon but later they incorporated nutmeg and cloves other recipes from molasses cookies called for liquids like milk sour milk cream and then coffee or water um and this speaks to all of the regional varieties of molasses cookies throughout time next is a teaspoon of baking soda [Music] okay so it's time to add our flour to the mixture the original recipe calls for enough flour to quote make the dough soft which is not an exact measurement so we're going to start off with two cups of flour adding a cup at a time and if we need to add more then we will looks like two cups of flour was not actually enough so we're gonna add an additional cup and see if that's a little bit better [Music] it looks like we actually still need one more cup of flour so this is gonna make it four cups and we'll see if that gives us the consistency that we need [Music] it is now time to roll out our cookie dough onto a flat floured surface we're going to take a rolling pin and we are going to roll out the dough until it is about a fourth of an inch thick [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so after you roll out your dough you're going to take your cookies and you're going to place them on a greased cookie sheet the molasses proved to be really trendy throughout the early 20th century but it also proved to be the source of one of america's more bizarre tragedies and i'm talking of course about the great molasses flood of 1919. so in january 1919 a tank containing 2.3 million gallons of molasses exploded in boston's north end it was owned by the united states industrial alcohol and was 50 feet tall and 90 feet in diameter which is about five stories tall around lunchtime that day the tank exploded and flooded downtown boston and this wave of molasses moved at a speed of approximately 35 miles an hour and because molasses is a non-newtonian substance kind of like ketchup or whipped cream or toothpaste it moved like a mudslide or an avalanche or a lava flow and it ended up soaking several blocks reaching depths of two to three feet in some areas and in the process this molasses crushed great cars it destroyed a firehouse and it almost lifted a train right off of the tracks this tragedy caused the death of 21 people and it injured 150 others many were crushed by the wave of molasses or the debris or they drowned and others died from injuries and infections that happened subsequently in order to clean up the aftermath of the disaster the area was host with salt water from fire boats and the streets were covered with sand cleanup was time consuming and labor intensive and rumor has it that boston continued to smell like molasses for several decades afterwards there were three uh theories that were put forth to explain what caused the disaster one was an explosion due to fermentation the other was a potential bomb that had been set off and the third was structural failure of the tank and in litigation that followed the tragedy u.s industrial alcohol who owned the tank was deemed liable and the court cited poor inspections and a lack of safety factors so again molasses was a key not only in american food and cuisine but also key in one of the more peculiar peculiar and devastating tragedies in our national history sprinkle the top of the cookies with a little bit of granulated sugar before you put them in the oven okay our molasses cookies are ready to go into the oven we're gonna cook them for about eight minutes and then we're gonna pull them out let them rest for about two minutes and then transfer them to a wrap to cool the bulk of imported molasses was actually consumed within the continental colonies the colonists themselves consumed about 90 of the rum available almost 20 gallons per year for each adult male in the 1790s before domestic whiskey became a popular and a competitor the new england rum industry was incredibly productive molasses beer was also easy to make less expensive than commercial beer and it was a healthier alternative to impure water other than rum and molasses beer molasses was also in other drinks like the quote black strap which was a mix of ramen molasses and the quote whistle belly vengeance which combined home brew molasses and brown bread crumbs and was served hot in 1733 the british parliament passed the molasses act and this was an attempt on britain's part to increase its share of the market by adding a really firm tax to the molasses that was imported from the french west indies to the british colonies in the process though it threatened to destroy the new england rum industry although enforcement was fairly inconsistent but the unrest caused by the molasses act and other legislation like the sugar act contributed to the discontent in the colonies which would later erupt into the american revolution it's time to take our cookies out of the oven let's see how we did [Music] the 1913 recipe recommends letting the cookies remain on the hot cooking sheets for two more minutes so that they bake a little bit longer after that two minutes we'll take them off put them onto a rack and let them cool it's true that the islands of the caribbean seed proved to be valuable sources for cane sugar and molasses which was distilled in trump and rum was a substantial colonial industry almost to the point where rum was kind of like a form of currency but the total average yearly export of rum to africa for instance from all of the mainland colonies between 1768 and 1772 was only about 1 8 of the total production of the period so not a lot and there was essentially no market for molasses in europe instead the majority of molasses and rum exports from the continental colonies um went northward actually to areas like newfoundland prince edward island quebec and nova scotia and several thousand gallons were actually traded to native americans for furs and skins as well as other colonial neighbors in florida the bahamas and bermuda okay it's time how do our molasses cookies taste we are about ready to find out oh okay they're pretty good um they're crunchy that's kind of a surprise i i thought maybe that they would be chewier but they're quite they're quite crunchy um not exactly cracker-like but there's definitely kind of like a harder biscuit quality to these there's a a really strong molasses flavor as well so i think you really need to like molasses i've seen molasses and other historic recipes like with gingerbread or spice cookies so maybe if it had a little more sweetness to temper it out because there's actually no sugar in these cookies other than the dusting on top or maybe some spices to help create a more robust flavor and reinforce the molasses i mean they're they're fine they're good so we'll take it it's like a graham cracker honestly it's got a very graham cracker light quality to it laura eagles wilder is perhaps one of the most beloved children's authors in american history she was born in february 1867 and her family moved throughout the american frontier as a pioneer family settling in wisconsin woods kansas prairies the plains of minnesota and settling eventually in the dakota territory her little house books are partially autobiographical based on these experiences and her stories were later adapted into the tv show little house on the prairie food was a major focal point of pioneer life and wilder documented a variety of recipes in her personal cookbook which consisted of a scrapbook of recipes and clippings from throughout the 1930s and 1940s when molasses cookies were especially popular and according to the now out of print cookbook the laura ingalls wilder country cookbook which was based on wilder's compilation and collection of recipes we can see her fondness for molasses cookies as well for instance in her molasses cookie recipe she included coconut and orange extract and described the final product as a hearty old-fashioned cookie jar cookie so we see that not only did normal americans enjoy this particular treat but some of our more recognizable american icons did as well hey come here and make cookies our second taste tester is here what do you think not them not the most amazing cookies that i've ever eaten but they're tasty what do you think i thought it was kind of graham cracker like very dense yeah the reviews are in molasses cookies have been described as some of american children's favorite desserts for instance it was a popular late summer early fall dessert and according to one newspaper a lot of children depended on them for their quote lunch dessert so they would eat them regularly if not daily a newspaper from 1937 claimed that these cookies embody all of the desirable qualities of a cookie that should find its way into a cookie jar advertisements in the evening star newspaper from 1943 for rare rabbit molasses said that three tablespoons supplied about a third of children's daily minimum requirement for iron which was imperative for quote good red blood so there was this idea that was echoed in a 1949 newspaper that molasses cookies were actually nutritious if not delicious and a few years before that in 1919 in another advertisement for molasses there was this claim by one doctor that molasses is one of the healthiest foods a mother can serve children not quite sure about that but i'm sure that it sold a lot of molasses and encouraged a lot of people to make molasses cookies well we did it again on this episode of home cooked history we tried to recreate a historic recipe from molasses cookies turned out fairly well let's put this one and he would recommend but with changes category overall uh it was a really neat experience and we have several dozen cookies left over so thank you for joining us for this installment hopefully we see you next time and in the meantime keep in mind that password present everybody's gotta eat thanks everyone you", "l2UNs9W7YUw": "hey guys I'm Jackee Tris on the test kitchen manager here at TC New York and today we're gonna be making some Mexican piggy gingerbread cookies also known as Marigny toes the piloncillo so here we have dark brown sugar but if you're able to find Cologne CEO and you want to use it this is it so feelin CEO is basically hardened cane juice its sugar in its purest form so something to make your life so much easier is to use a serrated knife you don't see you is really really hard and a serrated knife just helps cut easier my grandmother used to make them for holidays or special occasions when there wasn't money to buy a cake or desserts these cookies are relatively inexpensive in Mexico because piloncillo is actually cheaper than regular sugar so this cookie is very very popular in Mexico so modern interlinking it does just basically translates to Piggy's so many American recipes call these Mexican gingerbread cookies well there is no ginger in the dough but what I really love about this cookie is that it's so forgiving it's very hard to mess up and it takes a few simple ingredients to make something super delicious so there aren't many Mexican bakeries here in New York and that's why my mom asked my grandma for this recipe so we would be able to bring back a little piece of our culture here into the city she used to make them with whatever she had around so that's why a lot of recipes call for more spices we usually only had cinnamon so that's what we use and she used to have a little fruit stand so that's why we added orange zest just to give it an extra zing but honestly I feel you can learn a lot from people through their food because at the end of the day food is what connects us all so if you don't have a picky cookie cutter that's okay don't worry you can use whatever cookie cutter you have it will be less traditional but you will still have delicious cookies and that's what adding an egg wash just gives your cookies a beautiful shiny gloss in the end it's also gonna help them Brown a little better these cookies are just a crowd-pleaser edges are super crunchy and then you get to the middle and it's just soft honestly it's the best of both worlds you can give them away to your friends and family and they will love you forever oh yes [Music] [Music]", "Nendl3epLfY": "[Music] so [Music] so you", "5M-Kp8wrawg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so

few of the ingredients that we're using and then we will dive into the rest we are making this recipe in partnership with simply organic so we are using there vanilla extract in this recipe we are also using some of their ground ginger to make them nice and spicy and then we are finishing it out with some of their allspice and this is part of simply organics cook for a change campaign I highly recommend you hop on over to their profile and check out more about this campaign it's amazing and it's all about encouraging you to cook from scratch this holiday season which is exactly what we are about to do we're gonna do is make a flax egg we're gonna add 1 tablespoon of flax seed meal into a small bowl along with 3 tablespoons of warm water and this is essentially just replacing our egg to make them vegan so then we just whisk it all together and let it sit for five minutes the base of our cookies is almond butter so we have half a cup of almond butter in the bowl then we are going to add 1/3 cup of coconut sugar as well as that flaxseed egg that we made and you can see as I pour it in that it's got really jelly kind of like an egg and for a little extra flavor we're going to add some of simply organics vanilla extract to this cookie recipe for the spices we are adding one teaspoon of ginger this makes them kind of spicy and tastes like ginger snaps and then we're also going to use a quarter teaspoon of simply organics allspice and I love how the allspice really complements the ginger and molasses and it totally rounds out the flavors and to finish everything off we are going to do a quarter teaspoon of baking soda as well as a quarter teaspoon of sea salt and we are going to be adding in three tablespoons of coconut flour you all that we've dropped all of our cookies onto our cookie sheet we're just going to gently flatten them with our fingers you might want to have wet hands cuz the dough is pretty sticky but basically you just quickly and gently flatten them down and then I love sprinkling them with a little bit of raw turbinado sugar this gives them a little bit of like a crackly top adds a little bit of extra sweetness which makes them perfect for the holidays and it looks so so pretty when they come out of the oven you now once we pull these babies out of the oven we're gonna let them cool for about 10 minutes right here on the pan then we can transfer them to a wire rack and let them cool completely and that will make sure that they get kind of hard on the outside and stay nice and chewy on the inside and then once they've cooled completely I just wanted to show you the texture so you can see they're kind of crispy on the outside and they are nice and chewy and gooey in the middle just as molasses cookies should be oh I hope you give this recipe a try this holiday season as you can tell they are simple to make and I promise no one will know they are healthy I just want to thank you for tuning in and watching I also want

spice cookies and it's better known as molasses cookies I'm going to show you a few of our ingredients we'll be using and then we'll get started we're going to be using flour some brown sugar ground ginger ground cinnamon butter egg baking soda and molasses so let's get started err by adding in our 3/4 of a cup of butter using depending on how many cookies you want to make this this one this recipe makes about 35 cookies if you want to double it of course your settings don't be left the recipe so I'm gonna cream these together we're gonna be adding in a teaspoon full of ginger and you can always use a little bit more ginger all the Pens on al spicy you want it and we're going to be using one teaspoonful cinnamon we're also going to be using a half a cup of molasses now of course if your molasses is cold it's gonna take a while to pour but mine was open so I had it in the fridge so it's a little colder better half of okay so let me just scrape this now out into our boat and then we'll start creaming dance all of these ingredients together and that will start incorporating making it creamy before we adding into flour and everything else also you can use the light brown sugar or you could use the dark brown sugar whichever you prefer and you could use a wooden spoon fork or a food processor to mix it all together okay so I got that nice and creamy now I'm gonna add in my egg okay so we'll have 1 egg and you don't need to pre mix that egg before you and just toss it right into the mixture and it's slowly incorporate this together you don't want to over beat this because we want to add in now our baking soda and our flour put in there 1 teaspoon full of baking soda and you can pour it directly right on top and wait and slowly corporate death together you don't need I'm gonna put in first start mixing that together and at some point there when you're mixing you'll find that your letter is getting a little more dense so you'll want to start working it with your hand and so you can form it into a bubble but just at first you could use your your wooden spoon or fork and I'm just slowly incorporate all of it together slowly and you can sip it if you want but this is already sick so don't you put in some more flour starting to get a little dense so shortly I will be incorporating all this together in my hands so this is the type of cookie that you could make with your kids you could make a day before if you're expecting companies and you can keep it in your fridge or freeze them and then make them when they they arrive because it's only 10 10 to 12 minutes depending on your the heat in your oven so I'm gonna throw this together now in to keep forming a bottle I've been after they're almost ready for making our cooking sets okay so you just press it down like this one way is fine and then release it and you continue doing this with each one of the cookies and told you got them all done and then put them in the oven on a 350 degree eat for 10 to 12 minutes and and a nice and spicy and chewy cookie and put that one in the pan then I'll put press these down as well so again 350 degree oven takes 12 minutes and taking them you're ready

nice week you", "35Q8ziK8mms": "hey good Gators well it was a hundred plus degrees outside for quite a while and now it's in the 60s feels great it's got that brisk fall smell in the air kind of got me in the mood to bake some cookies I live you love cookies I think everyone at watch the channel knows that so let's make some fall specials some molasses cookies [Music] these are not the quickest cookies but they are very delicious let's start with the wets so you've got a stick and a half of butter one egg and a tablespoon of water moving on to the drives we have two and a quarter cup of flour we have two teaspoons of ginger we have one teaspoon of baking soda and then we have 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and then even more there's a full cup of sugar 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and any quarter teaspoon of salt and then the cornerstone of all of this molasses we would putting a quarter cup of molasses into these cookies you ready yeah ok here we go so we start with melting the butter you can unwrap those and then we'll put them in the microwave for a minute let them melt down so we've melted the butter we're gonna add an egg I let Liberty do that then we're also gonna add a tablespoon of water to this as well I'll get the tablespoon water now there's an egg in there I'm going to add a tablespoon of water and it completes the wet outside of the molasses of course something else to note I have set the oven at 350 so it's preheated right now and ready to roll all right so now let's blend this up so something I always do is I combine the wets and drys separately if you put them all into one big bowl it doesn't really mix properly you've got the wets and the dry is kind of like mixing into a swirl like a marble and you don't really get the even flavors you'll bite into one cookie and it'll taste great and you'll buy it another one you're like bull you might even bite into one and it's way too sweet or way too salty so it's just best to put all of your drives together mix that then put all your wets together and mix that now let's mix up the drives again two and a quarter cup of flour in the bowl yeah there we go just do a dry I'll tell what this so that's a full cup of sugar nice you want your next just be careful with those little ones so this is cloves so a half teaspoon of cloves in the bowl nice now a quarter teaspoon of salt are you going that way you gonna get that is cinnamon and goes the cinnamon that is baking soda what else we got here ginger yeah a very fall flavored cookie indeed there it goes it'll mix all of this up and now finally we will add the molasses yeah okay so that concludes mixing up molasses cookies I'm gonna scoop these out put them on a cookie pan and stick them in the oven for around ten minutes I'm gonna watch them like I always do and make sure they don't burn you want to lick one of these well all right it tastes like ginger snaps and these that's what these will taste like these will taste like ginger snaps but they won't be snappy they won't be crunchy they'll be very chewy gooey does that I like crunchy I don't like crunchy cookies I don't think those are fun at all I never have like crunchy cookies any time I went to a birthday party and they had Chips Ahoy cookies I didn't understand it no thank you don't want to pass our pass back in 1919 there was this great molasses flood actually killed people there was this enormous vat of molasses it was holding 2.3 million gallons of molasses and the thing burst and it poured on down through the city I can't imagine a worse situation personally I can't stand anything that's sticky it drives me crazy I walk across this sticky floor it's like goosebumps all over me my hair standing up I can't stand it all right so we're gonna put these in the oven at 350 for around 10 minutes and I'm gonna watch them like a hawk like I always do because cookies burn and here's the final product now these cookies taste just like Ginger Snaps however they are not crunchy I have to admit even looking at these on the camera they don't look too they look like a crunchy cookie they've got this kind of darker crust here but I promise like they saw you can hear there's a snap or anything there a soft cookie so I could squash it here there you go there you go so see it is a soft cookie and like I need to go eat a bunch of candy", "OHhYO1Oz130": "hey guys christmas is just a few short weeks away and if you were feeling a little bit anxious about all the gift-giving don't be we've gotten together with a few of our favorite YouTube channels to bring you this playlist holiday gift-giving one of my favorite things that I love to give around the holidays are some homemade Christmas cookies they're easy they're inexpensive and who doesn't love a homemade treat around the holidays now here's my take on Christmas cookies I feel like over the last couple years people have really gotten glitzy adding lots of frosting and sprinkles and all kinds of glitz when I think of a great Christmas cookie I think of something beautiful and natural but doesn't have a lot of artificial ingredients and for me that's a gingerbread man so the first step is is to combine your dry ingredients you're gonna take some flour some baking soda ground ginger cinnamon some allspice cloves and a nice pinch of salt whisk that all together until it's combined and then set aside then you're gonna beat together some butter and some sugar just until it's really nice and fluffy then you're slowly going to add the molasses and some vanilla once that's all combined you're then going to start to add your dry ingredients just in thirds you want to do it slowly just incorporating in between each addition until it's completely mixed once the dough is combined you're going to turn it out onto a well floured surface then what I will normally do at this point is divide the dough into three equal pieces the reason I do this is I normally will not cook all these cookies at once in fact I will keep them in my refrigerator and then bake them off as needed when I have a gift to give so if you're like me and you always want to have fresh dough on hand this is a great way to go you're gonna put the dough in your refrigerator just for one to two hours that's gonna make it easier to roll out now if you're really in a hurry you could pop it in the freezer for 20 minutes that would also work too once your dough is ready you're gonna roll it out to 1/8 of an inch thick when it comes to shapes I am a traditionalist and I do love to use the gingerbread man but then I also like to switch it up a bit and maybe use a Christmas tree or the mitten or a reindeer whatever you have on hand that you like will work however I will say this if you're switching up shape just make sure they're all roughly the same size that way they'll all cook at the same rate once your cookies are all cut out then it comes time to decorate it I really find that currants work better than reasons they're just smaller and they actually work better when you want to use them for things like eyes or buttons so go ahead and just decorate your cookies however you like for the gingerbread man I like to do eyes and buttons for the mittens I like to do a little trim along the top and for the Christmas trees I certainly love to put a few ornaments and a star on top so here's the final tip you want to pop your cookie tray in the refrigerator just for about five to ten minutes to allow them to firm up since you spent some time decorating these cookies and mix that out they've probably come to room temperature and that is the depth for gingerbread men because once those sort of room temperature dough hits a really hot oven they'll sort of go all over the place and they won't really retain their shape so it's much better to have a very cold cookie hitting a very hot oven and then you'll find you'll have a perfect shaped gingerbread cookie you're gonna bake your cookies just for eight to ten minutes you'll see they'll start to kind of puff up a little bit I really like to pull them out at about eight to nine minutes just because I like the chewy gingerbread cookie but if you like them more on the crispy side definitely go the full ten minutes then to package them up here's what I like to do I like to take one of those clear plastic treat bags add about six cookies to the package I find that they will sit up better if you use the same cookie rather than mix-and-match then I'll fasten them together with some of the twist ties that the treat bags come with then I'll take some red ribbon tie it in a knot and then in keeping with that kind of traditional old-world theme I like to take just some fake evergreen and you can get the large Garland's of it at a craft store and really try to look for the ones that come with the fake pinecones I think those are even better then I'll take a little floral wire fastened it at the end and that will then allow you to a fix it to the knot then I'll tie the ribbon in a bow and then for a gift tag I also like to keep things looking natural and handmade and I'll take some of those inexpensive Manila shipping tags a little Christmas stamp create a stamp on the front and then on the back I'll create a two and a front fasten it to your treat bag and then you're good to go I love this idea because it's so simple it's inexpensive and it's easy and these are the gifts that I can give to all of my preschool teachers my babysitter neighbors whoever just happens to pop by will normally get one of these little gingerbread packets so I hope you guys give this one a try I'm sure that anyone on your gift list would love to receive one of these but be sure to stick around and watch the other videos in this playlist there's some other really wonderful holiday gift ideas that I'm sure your friends and family are gonna love", "DjSOX6IR8iM": "[Music] [Music]",

that little warmth so if you want to see how they make them then keep on watching so for our ingredients we're going to be using some unsalted butter some flour some baking soda and salt and then we've got our spices so our ginger our cardamom our cinnamon clove and a pinch of black pepper and then we've got our molasses our brown sugar and then we're just going to put all the dry ingredients together so our spices into the flour oh also forgot we've got some eggs here too and we're just going to add our spices into our dry ingredients and then we're going to add in our baking soda and our salt and set it aside and then we're going to melt our butter [Music] so that we can add in our brown sugar and our molasses and then our eggs so now that our butter is melted we're just going to add our brown sugar in and just stir it around this is also a really good way to get rid of any lumps you might have in some brown sugar I'm using fancy molasses but you can use any molasses of your choice and we're just gonna stir this until it comes together it won't be completely together because of all the melted butter and then we're going to add our eggs which will bring everything together because eggs are a natural emulsifier [Music] so now we're going to add our dry ingredients which we're going to give a mix and also a quick sift into our wet ingredients so that we can mix them all together and then we're just going to stir this until our cookie dough is nicely combined and then we're just going to make sure all the dry ingredients are fully incorporated before wrapping it in some plastic wrap and placing it into the fridge to chill for one hour and feel free to chill it overnight if you have the time so while the cookie dough was chilling in the fridge I made some cinnamon sugar which is just about 1 TSP cinnamon 2 3 tablespoon sugar and I just use that to roll my cookies in for baking you can also use it to sprinkle on top and now that the cookies are fully chilled it is time to scoop them dip them and bake them so I'm just using a cookie scoop that has about 50 grams of dough and if you wanted to make your cookies a little bit smaller feel free to do so or use any cookie scoop that you want and I'm just going to lay 6 cookies onto my tray because they're huge and they will spread a lot so what I'm doing is just scooping in my dough into my cinnamon sugar rolling it around and then placing it down on my baking tray if you do have coarser sugar feel free to use that because mine dissolved in the oven with the cookie [Music] [Music] so my cookies baked for about 11 to 13 minutes at 350 degrees so you want to be sure to check them as they're baking check them past 10 minutes and see how they're doing you can tell the cookie is done when the edges start to get a little bit darker and browned and the top looks completely matte they will puff up a little bit because that's just normal during baking but once it chills it will deflate so here are my finished ginger molasses cardamom cookies and mmm they smell so good the sugar dissolved as it was baking in the oven so I actually sprinkled a little more sugar when it came out of the oven and now they look all nice and sugary which is perfect for the holiday and after they were cooled I put them in this little cookie jar which i think is sort of perfect like the size of the cookie compared to the jar so know it's time to eat them mmm they smell very similar to gingerbread cookies but the texture they are super soft mmm I mean phooey and the outside is just a little bit crisp these are so perfect the smell and the taste just screams Merry Christmas because it's spiced so these cookies are perfect for the holiday and they're super easy to make they come together within minutes and these make the perfect gift for Santa or a friend or family and if you want the recipe it'll be in the description box below as always if you enjoyed watching these cookies be made then

make them [Music] we're going to start with our wet ingredients so i'm using a large bowl because ultimately our dry ingredients will be added into this as well so we're going to start with a half of a cup of butter flavored crisco i know just go with it we're going to mix this [Applause] add one cup of brown sugar once your brown sugar and butter flavored crisco are nice and combined and fluffy you'll add a half cup of pumpkin puree quarter cup of molasses mix one more time awesome wet ingredients done let's move on to dry i have two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour two which i'll add a half teaspoon of kosher salt two teaspoons of baking soda one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon a half a teaspoon of ginger half a teaspoon of clove and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg awesome that's it for the dry ingredients now we'll just combine the two i'm going to slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet in two separate parts this batter is totally eggless so go ahead and taste it not that that's ever stopped me before now for the tough part we're gonna let this chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours i know sorry guys it's worth it though now let's move on to the pumpkin cream frosting this is so good we're gonna start with three ounces of softened salted butter and three ounces of cream cheese once the butter and cream cheese are fully combined and nice and light and fluffy you'll add a half cup of powdered sugar what's nice about this frosting is it's not overly sweet which is great because the cookies definitely are you stop [Applause] add one tablespoon of heavy cream and a pinch of salt [Music] and now for the best part pumpkin spice spread we're going to add three tablespoons to this [Music] hey this frosting is reminiscent of a cheesecake filling because it's not overly sweet and obviously because of the cream cheese in it and it this really nice light orange color you guys are seriously going to love this it complements the cookies so well no the time has come our dough has been hanging out in the refrigerator for two hours it's nice and chilled so now we're going to scoop and we're going to roll in some granulated sugar bake at 350 degrees for 9 to 10 minutes or until the tops begin to crack all right the cookies are done they cooled for about 10 minutes and they look awesome i have our pumpkin cream frosting i put it into a ziploc and i just snipped the tip off and now we're going to form our sandwich cookies oh my gosh look how good that looks so i have some orange sprinkles here i'm just going to dip the edges into the sprinkles so you certainly don't need to do this but look how fabulous that looks super impressive i was supposed to mention you want to let these sit a little bit otherwise the frosting completely oozes out of the cookie whatever oh man it's so good as always the full recipe is listed down in the description so make sure to check it out smash that like button and we'll see you all next tuesday

little bit of something fun I thought it might be nice to do a virtual cookie exchange and by that I mean that me and a few other YouTube cooks are going to be doing cookie recipes and today I'm gonna be sharing my soft molasses cookies that come from a recipe that I was so fortunate to get when someone that I knew at the church that we used to attend in Williams Arizona shared it with me these are Colleen Houston's soft molasses cookies and they are the most delicious soft molasses cookie that you will ever make or put in your mouth they're perfect for a lunchbox they're perfect or for Christmas and they have all of those warm delicious holiday spices that you associate with this time of year and there are a few other people who are participating in the cookie exchange Stephanie Manley from copykat.com rocky beragon from her youtube channel and i will link all of those below in the more information box and there will be a slide at the end of the video where you can link to their to their recipes as well I think that a few others might be participating but right now those are the only two that I have confirmation of so we're gonna get started we're going to go over the ingredients and we're going to get baking okay this is what we're gonna need four ingredients or we need 1/2 a cup of molasses one and a half cups of granulated sugar 2 eggs four cups of all-purpose flour two sticks of butter or a cup of butter and then we're gonna go over here and we're gonna also need two and a half teaspoons of baking soda and a half a teaspoon of salt and in here we have two and a half teaspoons of ground ginger one and a half teaspoons of ground cloves and one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon and that's all there is to this cookie and it's absolutely fantastic I got this recipe from a woman who I used to go to church with when I lived in Arizona and they are hands down the very best soft molasses cookie you will ever put in your mouth so I'm gonna go ahead and clear bring the mixer over and we're gonna get started mixing up this cookie dough okay I went ahead and I I beat this off and butter just a little bit to get it going I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna add our bringi ladies sugar in here without spilling it all over the counter oh I forgot to mention I have preheated my oven to 350 degrees we're gonna go ahead and get the butter pepper started okay now we're gonna add the molasses I'm just gonna go ahead and pour it in here now I actually sprayed my cup with some cooking oil before I started and it looks like it's gonna be stubborn so I'm gonna grab my stack I get my molasses from a local producer so it's a little bit different than the commercial stuff that you find on this shelf so we're gonna beat this until it's light and fluffy oh wow that does smell fantastic okay and over here what I'm gonna do with my flower is I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna add the salt and the baking soda and all of the spices right in here and I'm just gonna take a whisk and I'm gonna blend this in gently okay that's done now I'm gonna turn the mixer on low and I'm gonna spoon this flour mixture injustice insulin time okay you want to stop when you snow longer see any evidence of flour or raw flour in that dough so that's time to stop okay now the best part about these cookies as they are a drop cookie and they don't need to be refrigerated for any length of time before we start to prepare them so I got my oven going it's at 350 degrees I'm just gonna go ahead and gonna scrape this dough back into the bowl off of the beater and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna start rolling these into balls scooping them rolling them and getting this dough ready to bake second board alright we've got all of our stuff in place and now don't do that um we're gonna scoop these and this is a Oh what number if this is number forty scoops okay so we're using a one and a half inch diameter scoop and this ends up being a two tablespoon scoop after you scoop it you're gonna roll it in sugar and then you're gonna put it on a parchment or an ungreased cookie sheet I like to use the parchment because that guarantees then I'm going to get it off every time I notice that this one doesn't have quite enough sugar okay these go into a 350 degree oven for 11 minutes and then when these are ready to come out we'll come back and we'll show you what they look like all right these are ready to come out of the oven remember 11 minutes and not a second longer okay beautiful in goes the next batch don't forget to set your timer okay now we're gonna let these cool on the pan for just a few minutes before we remove them to a cooling rack and waling those that first batches in the oven you can go ahead and get all of your cookies rolled out and put on pans if you have enough pans and we're gonna allow these to cool and then we'll come back and I'm gonna show you what the finished product looks like you have it really delicious and beautiful soft these are still warm I'm just gonna break one open for you they're absolutely gorgeous they're delicious make sure you store these in an airtight container so they retain their softness and I promise you these aren't going to last long and you're gonna find yourself making these over and over again because these are a perfect lunchbox cookie not just for Christmas not just for special occasions

Stephanie Manley and all the other people who are participating in this virtual cookie exchange and until next time I'll see ya", "CVQsyVTYPyg": "hi and welcome to Wendy's AIP kitchen today I'm going to be making cute little gingerbread cookies the inspiration for these little guys came in a way that you are just not going to believe their I was trying to imagine what I might bake for Christmas when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a FaceTime call from the North Pole and when Santa calls you answer great it's good to see you what's up there was any chance you can make me an AI P cookie recipe anything for you Santa what's your favorite well you know I really like gingerbread and the best thing is the reindeer liked them too I got you bro I'll text you a recipe [Music] before you go Santa for Christmas maybe this year um a new food processor oh [Music] goody ok I'll talk to you later Santa tell the missus I'll see her in yoga class later Santa bye well when Santa asks for gingerbread cookies you supply gingerbread cookies so I searched through all my old recipes and I found my great-grandmother's recipe for gingerbread so I have adapted her recipe for the AIP we're starting with a 1/2 cup of palm shortening a 1/2 cup of pitted dates that I've chopped up and measured next is a 1/2 cup of blackstrap molasses and it's very gooey once you've got that all in here it's time to process now it's probably gonna go up on the sides and we'll have to scrape it down multiple times but that's okay this should be well processed it kind of looks like a dark nougat at the moment so we just let this sit for a minute and go on to the next step my great-grandmother's recipe called for one cup of soured milk so I'm using 1 cup of full fat coconut milk and I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar I'm gonna mix that a bit just let it sit tell them ready to use it now for the dry ingredients of which there are eight start first with one cup of cassava flour a cup and a half of arrowroot flour 1 teaspoon of dried powdered ginger and a half a teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon cloves 1 tablespoon of gelatin a teaspoon and a half of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar and now is your chance to get rid of all your holiday stress you whisk it all up now we're back to the food processor a really really old food processor okay so with the food processor on we're going to add the soured coconut milk the next thing we need to do is add the dry ingredients but I'm going to add them in batches just to make things a little bit easier so we've just had a little issue here in Wendy's AIP kitchen and if this happens to you I want to show you how to fix it okay so at this point it should be in a ball on the side of the food processor and it's not if this happens to you don't panic just add a couple of tablespoons of flour at a time until you get the desired consistency that's just about there and that looks like dough so now we're gonna put this into the refrigerator and chill it with plastic wrap over it for about 30 minutes so our dough has chilled it's all ready to go now the great thing about this dough is that there's no eggs in there so you can snitch the dough but the bad thing about this dough is that there are no eggs in it and you can snitch the dough now it's time to roll I've divided the dough into four workable pieces kind of patties if you will and I'm going to put them between two pieces of parchment paper to roll them out the here final trick I'm gonna take it a little bit over the edge of the counter and lean up against it so that it doesn't slip all over the place let's roll I've rolled the dough out to about a quarter of an inch you don't want it any thinner than this because then it might fall apart and you will cry so then you begin cutting once you've rolled out your dough and cut your shapes put them in a 375 oven for 10 minutes when your cookies are done take them out of the oven and let them cool before you decorate mmm it smells really good are you gonna need some AIP frosting to go on these cookies for the sake of time we put the recipe for the cookies and the frosting on my website you will find the link in the description join us next time on Wendy's EIP kitchen where we figure out how much Wendy's AIP kitchen was filmed before a live studio audience [Music]", "mRZc8nrH1NA": "[Music] I'm not usually the dessert maker around here but once in a while I get a pretty strong hankering for molasses I don't know if it's the iron the calcium what but I want it so I'm gonna make some gingerbread tough cookies I'll tell you what the tech part of that is in a minute the first step of making cookies is to cream the butter and sugar together and I've used one of these nice unrefined sugars that still has the molasses in it which is going to add more flavor and more a little bit more nutrients to important first step is to really cream that butter and sugar together don't don't slack off on that at all so that you can't tell one from the other then the rest of the wet ingredients that go in here are an egg there you go and I'm going to get that beaten in here and the molasses there's about two tablespoons of molasses and fresh ginger root yes gingerbread cookies need fresh ginger root you know that powder ginger compared to fresh ginger root is like nothing it's like nothing okay and so I'm putting the ginger in now and my molasses I'm gonna need a something that pull that out of there cause it's sticky did you know in 1917 there was some sort of escape of molasses somewhere and barrels of molasses and in and it killed seven people no I'm not kidding you got to look it up you got to trust me on that one and then vanilla so what was in here butter the unrefined cane sugar and egg molasses and ginger fresh ginger and vanilla pretty awesome now you could use a you know a hand mixer but I haven't been able to find ours since we moved and so that's not an option for me so I get to feel my arms flap around instead which is you know just a whole lot of fun okay so that's the wet in the dry ingredients I have a cup and 2 tablespoons of whole wheat pastry flour and I'll tell you why the odd measurement is there and I have freshly ground spices and yeah you can buy the pre ground once that's okay but if you take the whole spice and grind it fresh in like a little spice grinder a little coffee grinder the flavor just is at least three or four times what you get from a pre ground spice so the spices in here are cloves cardamom cinnamon and cloves cardamom cinnamon and allspice I knew I could do it the other flour that goes in here is teff flour and tap I'm going to put this in and start mixing these flours and spices together and the salt and baking soda are also in there TAF is this teeny teeny tiny grain that is indigenous to Ethiopia and if you've ever gone to an Ethiopian restaurant and had the bread that's called in jeera it's kind of stretchy that's it's it like elastic a stretchy and sticky and it's the TAF that makes it that way and so I like to put Taff in things like a gingerbread cookie or or or some other things and I have a friend that uses teff flour and brownies when you want that kind of sticky texture in there that's stretchy texture so that's that so that's my dry and that's my wet and I'm going to start putting those together give that another little stir and here's the deal with cookies um when you're using whole grain flours you're gonna have a softer batter then you are normally used to with white flour and white sugar because the the a fiber that's in the hole Green is going to suck up any liquid that's there and you could end up with kind of a dry hard cookie if you put too much flour in so that's why I always start any cookie that I'm making with whole-grain flour with less flour than I need so that I have a little leeway there and I can do it by texture instead of measurement so the recipe starts with a cup and 2 tablespoons of whole wheat pastry flour and the forth of cup of teff flour and once I get that all mixed up together I'm going to touch it with with moist hands and if the if the batter sticks to my hand then I don't have quite enough flour in there but if it's malleable you know formable into a ball without sticking to my hand that's the right texture so I'm going to touch this in a second here and see what I got it feels a little bit like that's gonna be a little yeah I can tell just by touching it's a little too wet so um you have to be careful with how much flour you add because if I add too much to this batter the cookie will get cakey and I don't want that I want a thin one of those kind of soft and stretchy in the middle kind of cookies so I probably put maybe a tablespoon or two in there maybe and let me wet my hands and try that yeah that's gonna work hey you look nice oh you look you can't talk oh you lost your voice no no no how you know I've told you before Jane you know when you when you scream that loud in the card really hurt your vocal chords and well I didn't didn't know Phil called you right did you talk to him and what'd he say what Oh and then I like to decorate the top with just like a little little white chocolate chip little red cranberry dried cranberry you know just to make it just to make it a little more festive and when they're done that's what they look like Oh Jane why don't you text you you know one of those little Muslim the little smiley face things in there and then he'll get [Music]", "czaQczt4QSM": "hi and welcome to ginger pop kitchen today we are starting off with one of my favorite festive cookies of all time gingerbread cookies not only are they adorable but they are chewy fluffy and delicious and they bring the flavors of the holiday together i will link the recipe in the description box below as far as measurements but let's get started with the wet ingredients first starting with the sugar and the butter give that a mix then add your molasses molasses gives these gingerbread cookies that famous light golden brown color and that fluffy chewy texture give that a good stir before you add your spices starting with cinnamon then ground ginger and then allspice and a little bit of salt and if you don't have allspice you can go ahead and skip that it could be optional give that a nice little mix and then what you want to do is add your egg and whisk that together to combine so once you get that mixed up you're going to start with your dry ingredients starting with one two three and a third cups of all-purpose baking flour adding your baking powder and baking soda give that a good whirl and before you add that to the batter go ahead and give the batter a nice little stir and scraping the sides of the bowl down it should be nice and wet just like that add your flour mixture in batches and then add a little bit at a time working that to create a dough and you don't want to see any white flour released or just get in there with your hands you just want to fold to combine do not knead it do not overwork it just go ahead and fold to combine and then i like to go ahead and grab it and kind of squeeze it and form a ball place it onto the cutting board and pack in as much as you can from the bowl creating a nice dome shape pack it firmly so that you can go ahead and cut it into half because uh i like to definitely recommend that you refrigerate this for one hour and then the other half you could work as well or you can refrigerate it for a week or even um freeze it for a month it'll hold and then you can whip out another batch at a later date flower your working surface and then using your rolling pin roll out to about a quarter of an inch thick and then use your gingerbread cookie cutter to wiggle out the pieces bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes let cool completely and then there you have it these delicious golden brown gingerbread cookies festive adorable new family tradition possibly it's become one of our favorite traditions to share during the holiday time and you can decorate them or have them as is thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next week bye", "EDC3GOx_K5E": "[Music] hey Chandler what's your favorite thing that mommy makes for you molasses cookies yes some people think they're good in the faller at the holidays but when do you think they're good whatever I am going to teach you how to make these cookies today are you ready right the first thing we're gonna do Chandler is combine our dry ingredients you always combined dry first and then your wet ingredients and then mix it together so we have here four and a half cups flour all right then we're also gonna add the first thing we're going to add is baking soda and there are two teaspoons of baking soda in this dish so I'm gonna have you put this baking soda in just pour it in yeah just pour it haha that is fine okay then we are going to add four teaspoons of ginger and that's what gives our cookies sort of that well gingery yes okay so you can add that important yeah Gordon okay nice work then we are going to add a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon and then one teaspoon of ground cloves so all those spices are what give the cookie like it's warm delicious taste right all right now I'm gonna have you gently stir this around so we want to make sure all those spices are mixed in that's good next what we're going to do what I've got in here is a cup and a half of shortening so the first thing we do is beat the shortening so why don't half cups and unlock my mixer I'm gonna turn on and we're gonna beat this until it's fluffy it's pretty good then the next thing we're gonna do is add what we call our wet ingredients so we've got um our molasses yeah and that's a half cup of molasses this is funny to me sugar is actually not wet at all but it always falls into the category of wet ingredients so we've got two cups of sugar and then when you're mind that also put in two eggs do you want to watch mommy do it first you I'm gonna crack the egg first so it's like a solid tap and then see I've got that crack there and then I just dig my fingers in and put it in there okay okay okay yep nice and only one tiny mishap all fixable Oh shells okay that was a good job next time you do it it'll be even easier okay so we've got our eggs in here and I do actually like to crack them in this little Bowl ahead of time before putting them in here and you know why what just happened what happened to our eggs it's to show why the shell one in there so that happens to mom sometimes too so instead of digging in here then I just can't get it out of there alright so then I'm gonna pour these eggs in plop so then we put our molasses in and there's a half cup doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo I always used the mild molasses not that you would know this but there's a full flavor molasses which you've probably never seen and also a mild molasses you put that entire thing in yeah you won't put it in if you do it you get it two cup sugar now we are going to put our mixer down and at this point I think I'm gonna put my shield on probably fine but we don't need a big mess right now do we next out ok so now we've got this and you can see the consistency it's almost right oh it's gooey but we need our flour to make it rise leavened do all the things that we needed to do right so I am going to be in the mixer with the flour because this is actually one of the hardest parts cuz it gets really puffy so you add just a little bit of flour at a time and mix and then add a little bit more now it smells like cookies so let's see how this was let's take this off here yeah look good it's not good this smells good okay are you ready to make some cookies make a ball about the size of this [Music] those look great I think we're ready all right set my timer for 12 minute so we left these in for 12 minutes just like I said pulled them right out and let them set up for like 30 seconds to a minute on our sheet but now I need to get them off because we don't want them to continue cooking so go ahead and use your spatula be very careful not to touch the side of your pan oh yeah I look good Chan I'm only getting one that's okay this was lots of fun things for baking with me any Tyler who involves cookies a quick tip for making your molasses cookies look even better is just drizzling some white chocolate over the top it makes them look special [Music]", "vyQNxnQr_0g": "hi this is Diane love to bake at what we're going to bake is glazed molasses cookies so let's get started in a large bowl you'll want to put one-and-a-half cups of butter that's been at room temperature now this particular recipe would probably be easier in your stand up mixer you can certainly do it by hand as I am but it makes a lot easier for you to stand up one okay now we're gonna start slowly putting in two cups of granulated sugar into the butter this is a great-tasting spice cookie if you do might be taste of molasses and ginger you really going to like this the next thing we're going to do is we're going to put in eggs and you need two eggs lightly beaten in at room temperature awesome and we're going to put that in with the cream mixture and beat the iron that was two eggs slightly this mixture is going to become extremely smooth all right and next thing we're putting in is of course molasses and we're going to put in a half a cup of that to get all of that out of my container all right and now we're going to be add in until it becomes smooth my spatula I'm just gonna clean those sides up alright I'll show you what we've got so far and I bring it all together it's going to become quite thick at this point and dense the banner okay the next thing is we're going to start bringing in the dry ingredients and we're going to be using four cups of all-purpose flour a little bit of thyme and this is when you can really start appreciating using a stand-up mixer because it's going to income very gifts and a big coming to work this stuff cookie dough yet these cookies come out very light they bake up really are crunchy on the crisp on the outside get in the center they're bright chewy their leader tasting party you're a flower I probably have about three cups in so far we're going to now add baking soda and you're going to put 2 teaspoons of baking soda yet and start beating the you're also going to be adding one teaspoon of cinnamon we're going to now put in 3/4 of a teaspoon of ginger we're also going to add 1/2 TSP of ground cloves I'm gonna go ahead and put the rest of the flour in next day I am too big cookie dough once I get it combined a little bit I'm gonna raise the speed here we go as you can see with the hand mixer it struggles just a little bit but it's still combining everything from bringing that cookie dough together I'll set that aside again I'm going to just make sure everything's combined and nothing sticking to the bottom of that bowl okay now we have the cookie dough it really smells so fragrant when you're making these cookies as well as when you bake them your whole house will have this wonderful spice smell to it all right now you're going to need of course a cookie sheet or baking sheet and you won't have to spray it over ISA you won't need any of that and what you want to do is I'm going to use my cookie scoop this one is about one in three quarters across and I like to level it off so that I have every cookie the same size now what I do though is I actually put it into my hand and then roll it into a ball and then place it on your cookie sheet and I space them about inch and a half to two inches apart now the reason that you do want to round them off is that you don't want to flatten this cookie because when it beats up it's going to flatten for you and the reason we roll the cookie is so again when they be they'll have a little bit of a puff to top to it if you you don't want to flatten them so just put them in like a round it ball and again now if you want to make them small or you can make them about the size of a walnut sized cookie if you make them about one inch you'll probably get all about anywhere from 45 cookie - you know 48 cookies the one in 3/4 you're going to come in up you know maybe a little bit less than that that type of thing but it's it's a large recipe it's going to make a nice amount of cookies for you now you're going to put these in of course a preheated oven at 350 and you're gonna bake them anywhere from 10 to 12 minutes or until they're done of course where the center's will be slightly soft okay and I'm gonna watch them closely because as we know all ovens set up differently now I have some to show you that have been baked of course and this is how they're going to come out now these aren't glazed of yet of course but you can see the nice rounded top to them and this beautiful golden brown on the bottom these cookies just come out so beautiful now these tastes really good on their own but you can actually make a glaze for them and it's really easy I usually take maybe a cup and a half of powdered sugar and anywhere from 2 to 4 tablespoons of either melt or water and then I just take the cookie plop it in the in the glaze roll off the sides like that and put it on a cooling tray until they dry and they will come out looking like this once they've been glazed in the glaze has hardened and then when you break them open you're going to have this great chewy Center yet the outside of the cookie will be crisp so what a great taste cookie with a cup of coffee or a cup of tea there you have it glazed molasses cookies give this recipe a try I hope you like this one if you do let me hear from you leave a comment and as always thanks for watching and please subscribe", "2QoT0FSen58": "hello everybody welcome to another episode of tasty Tuesday this week we are making something sweet and delicious that I probably made four or five times so far this last month soft and chewy ginger molasses cookies and they are the bomb so this is what you'll need guys all your ingredients here you need one egg three-quarter cups of sugar I use a little bit less because I'm weird like that um half a cup of vegetable oil you can also use coconut oil works really well one third of a cup of molasses I use real ginger that's two tablespoons of vanilla two teaspoons of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of baking soda and then two cups of flour and then a pinch of salt and that's it let's get started if you want to start by putting your egg sugar molasses and oil in the bowl and we're going to whip that up for about three or four minutes you can use your mixer or a handheld mixer or just whip it real good with a spoon whatever you prefer also add your two tablespoons of vanilla that's the mixing verbo treasonous yourself so you want to tell us nice and creamy like that now I like to add real ginger in the cookies because I feel like it just tastes so much better so I just let garlic mincer you can use ginger powder though if you prefer I use about 2 teaspoons of the real stuff ok so now I'll add that to a bowl also going to add your two teaspoons of cinnamon and pinch of salt let's do that also guys if you have nutmeg or clothes that would be really good to add some cookies I don't have any of that right now so I'm not going to add it but anyway if you have cloves about a teaspoon would be good and maybe half a teaspoon of nutmeg now you can add your two cups of flour and teaspoon of soda baking soda you want to mix it until it looks something like your hat now you can just eat it with a spoon now you want to create small or however big you want your cookies little balls like that stick them onto your pan okay so i got all my cookies on my pan here next I you don't have to do this but I mean this is pretty awesome if you do I just dampen a fork put it in some sugar Oh me me me can you just kind of squish down there we go waste you here we go so now they're ready to go in the oven I put them in at 350 for approximately nine minutes or so there we go and they're done I like to get them when they start to look all crackly and kind of golden around the edges yeah these are perfect so there you have it folks soft and chewy and ginger molasses cookies now for the recipe I'm going to change it and only add two teaspoons of vanilla next time I just changed it up and I had a 2 tablespoons I found I was a little bit too much so anyway do whatever you want they are still chewy and delicious so let me know if you try them and thanks for watching Chico we just be chillin", "7hzpnO0rSkU": "hello maybe they're moving now yeah you've been live for a few seconds oh my goodness well I'm rich delacro's I am the better half the naughty half of the lemon Volcom and today I'm going to show you a recipe that is near and dear to my heart probably one of my signature recipes and it's called the best Trebek cookie recipe and why are the best remember cookie recipe because one they're relatively easy to make very unique so I've been out here in Michigan now for like 10 or 11 years I brought them out here and people went crazy over them even some Executive Chefs and we're like these are really great what makes them so good one they have a lot of spices moves so they're quite different from a chocolate-chip cookie or a sugar cookie you just have a lot of flavor to them there's also kind of spices so as a whole bunches we get a ginger cinnamon allspice nothing ground cloves which you would even find very often in a cookie recipe and the the cookie themselves is a pretty historic I guess it's historic it's a New England treat so like Michigan didn't know they existed for me what always inspired me is my mom used to make them feel like a recipe on an index card or like I'm from Saugus Massachusetts we go through the clip to kneel square there was this bakery that used to sell them a dollar bag and they would just like awesome and the other good thing is they're great for kids snacks they are good for like if you have a school party and want to make them what Kate finds did some up and did like a little cookie cutter shapes on them so they're very personal it's a forgiving recipe so for some reason you need to cook times perfect you could certainly let them sit for a little bit and they'll they'll still be great to taste and they're good for days after from a history standpoint the cookies themselves go doing a little research I read one time that they go back to the shipbuilding days because the fact that they kept so long and ships but then as I started googling the internet a little bit more it looked like that was a little bit different so they start around somewhere around that 1880s ish out of the Lake Champlain Valley up in Vermont and they originally did not have molasses on them but they were still as you fall asleep with the story flame of rolled they were flavorful spice cookies and then they kind of made their way and it looks like they're like the 30s or 40s where they started adding egg as an ingredient in molasses to what they are today but the the main traditional ingredients of it did not include molasses so why don't you start making them and show us what the ingredients are as ago okay did you explain about the longevity of them yes they keep for a long period of time so like we have these for Christmas Day probably Christmas Eve but they'll they'll keep for like probably like a week the other thing too is my recipe is good because the fact that they go so fast the recipe actually makes one a cookie sheet of them which is nice so yeah it was like back to the shipbuilding days this is where the original history which I still have to kind of get a little extra verification on is that they used to make them back in like the 1700s for the fact that they kept well on ships that's where the the controversy between the molasses comes in because molasses was a food ingredient is kept for a long time all right let's go all right so first thing is we got my ingredients here so here we got four cups of flour all-purpose regular flour regular flour nothing fancy doctor does have to be organic or anything like that allspice allspice nutmeg cinnamon a little touch of salt you know it's forgiving I'm trying to think what else I forgot there ground cloves nutmeg cinnamon ginger I think I got them all and where can they find this recipe lemon Volcom and it's in the description of this file oh yeah that's what you did that's what so I'm gonna take these ingredients so the first thing we get actually going to do so this is a large bowl of the dry ingredients and then I go ahead and ice you can hold onto that for me for a second - I'm gonna actually take the brown sugar and come over here to the mixing bowl see I still have to cover the recipe even though I've been doing it for like like 20 years so I got to start with adding a little bit of brown sugar in here this is two cups packed brown sugar and add a little butter [Music] and I think this is unsalted but it really doesn't matter I mean I all right so then first of all we gonna do is just get this to the fact that it's just combined so that butter stop it most of the time I don't remember to take it out so I'll put it in the microwave for like 15 seconds just so it's a little it's not another trick you can take a hot glass and put it over it it'll steam it that's really cool yeah all right something's gonna run this a little bit here now don't be nervous about the whole mixing bowl thing because by the time this is ready to go it's gonna be like up and over it's gonna be pretty close to the top of the mixing you're saying don't worry about yes thank you so I'm just gonna get it mixed in there a little bit you're getting some heart light good it's getting nervous nobody like this I'm telling you if you don't like it you're gonna let me know but I haven't had anybody yet say oh rich is awful it's good all right so that's good [Music] well it's a little tough because it's just butter and as in this show it's the story is this Facebook story yeah yeah alright so we got that in there so next we do add molasses and egg until well combined so my assistant asher will bring it over to the whole lot of the molasses for me we'll start with the egg you're getting right there all right ready okay one two three now obviously rich you know you're supposed to correct with it was difficult but I'll be honest I never do that either this is why it's the naughty lemon Bowl now the nice lemon if you were a novice chef I would crack the eggs in the bowl just to make sure like if you have your kids helping yeah so this shows them true exactly I try to be careful I mean somebody eats a shell I mean now I also always thought your sister crack an egg on this not on this I tell you I'm an SEO computer guy huh chef by heart I just follow your chef Ernest all right here we go here we go dose eggs and then molasses this is the good stuff I don't pick usually regular molasses it's usually some sort of robust molasses is one called grandma's out there's another one that has a car Abbott on it they're usually pretty good sort of [Music] yeah you want to keep your kids up all night make sure you feed them a few of these before bed yeah this is like rocket it's good all right hold on here I gotta take this out a little bit scraper and gooey get this out there so good it didn't smell Johnson looks awesome a mouth yeah for college students who need to pull an all-nighter and they need a snack this stuff is guaranteed to keep you awake like for a seven-year-old for seven-year-olds doing all night so so far we've got brown sugar butter and molasses right correct correct right here that makes it a little bit more I did to John uh Uncle John likes you're near hey he says here no answers all right so we now get the base so let's do a recap of what's in this for people that are just tuning in you can read it from the recipe thank you so four cups of all-purpose flour two teaspoons of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon of baking powder one teaspoon of baking soda one teaspoon of ground ginger don't don't use fresh ginger 1/2 teaspoon of ground nothing movie yeah exactly I wonder it 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves 2 cups of packed brown sugar and the complete recipe is where complete recipe is the best hermit cookie recipe on the lemon Bolcom 2 large eggs 2 cups of each so we ready to proceed oh we are alright bring this over here alright so I'm gonna start running this and then very slim wait yeah no I never recur you know because the secret is is I just listen it's all about shortcuts here I know like I'm not going to be proper about it alright alright so this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna start this running and then I and I'm gonna slowly start tapping it in this part is a little boring so I have to do a little bit I do a little bit and then I kind of wait for it to kind of solidify a little bit once you start mixing it because you get all those you get that cinnamon and then love the cloves instantly starts turning into this bull this is a big forgiveness factor so you're not perfect on all the ingredients if anybody notices I'll be shocked there should be one day I'll make this beer can maybe I will yeah grandma Jones good good at these between her and and the fact that as a small kid going to a bakery and buying a bag of these for a box you could buy this in the bakery it was a place up in Saugus and next to the post office I forgot the name of the bakery and they used to just have stacks of these in bags and it was like this takes a little while because if you dump it all in one batch it's just gonna fly up batch up huge great big mess I also want to make sure it's mixed so it doesn't look really wrong yeah I just do it in little baby steps [Music] does anybody think it should start my own baking channel yes rich I was on baking YouTube what do you think if it were it probably called I think it should be called sweet riches or maybe it could be called like the naughty lemon Bowl all bad recipes though make your kids oh yes [Applause] I probably I'm telling people people gotta make this for Christmas I'm Gary how do you guys love this you will love it I don't know people like it more than cookies but it's a party they're really good cook I'm ready I don't all right I'm sorry it's taking so long folks it's like it says one of those things if I dump the whole thing in it shoots out and then I got a stop in a minute a cleaning extend it's got a warning stuff they've even watching daddy recipes made them know I'm getting my point here folks don't worry I'm almost out of this dance now you can hear the kitchen needs starting to strain a little heater all right so hold on I'm going to stop it here I got to start scraping up the dough a little here because I want to make sure it's mixed you always say that I had thought that every and you know what if you took the recipe as is and add salted butter to it probably got the salty water here we missing any ingredients at the races oh right so then we're gonna add 2 cups of reasons to this just to combine it you see the reason Sir Andrew ones no just help it is sadly we're not endorsing the I guess you go little faster you know people are falling asleep no it's done yeah kitchen ain't starting to scream Moodle yeah as you can see the bowl is fairly full once again I'm gonna scrape it down because the last thing I want is my guest - yeah get into some white dough all right thank you really 3,000 people mix in my dough and then the bulldog mix my invisible dough hey that takes too much work though I never tried that actual cookie but no I don't wait get this out now so what I'm doing is just scraping all the dough off that's what your fingers sharp knives remember guys push the pot to try so over here I use one of the women bulls traditional ingredients of shortening and flour so I put at Cody the small coating of shortening around dusted with flour that's just to ensure that there's a bottom it's easy to pull off on the sheet and then while I'm doing that and just scraping the corners of the bowl now that I get everything mixed in 350 know it's intentional yeah so so I always wanted to cook evenly so it's 17 to 19 minutes but usually I have this pendulum usually halfway through I rotate it from the bottom rack to the top rack so this next even cook to it okay so it's intentional so you cook it on the lower rack to start yeah so I take a little bit of flour who's gonna dust my hands here [Music] all right so now I'm gonna go ahead put this out blob with how much he loves a big chunk alright so now what make the ice cream ice cream meatloaf so now buddy flour my hands I'm gonna flour them a few times lion what you get then what I start doing is nicely or whatever and then usually I go like this so the you up to the game is not to have one particular area to to um there's baby powder hold on Ash now when you push you want to be pushing it out to the edges - yeah you also want to make sure your hands stay consistently flour yes don't worry about getting it to every corner that's not necessary no see this is what I call the nub so basically after I cook it I'm like oh this is bad then you can splice in there well guess what I cut those out and eat them all right all right this is ready all right not too hard you heard of my cookie any questions from the audience Halloween party was it your birthday party no my birthday party did anybody eat him all right teach you like him all right that's good we're good so now us all right just start with the bottom wrap so because this oven runs a little hotter I have on the recipe 17 to 19 minutes but I would probably do it for about 17 minutes so I'm gonna set the timer for eight minutes I really encourage you to make them they might look a little creepy but they're really really good and I never had anybody he asked my coworkers every time I bring them in they go crazy so I encourage you to make them look good and she's never and make sure you tag the lemon bowl so that I can actually see the photos thank you [Music]", "WVbnMsPK1X0": "today we're making my great-grandma's molasses crinkle cookies this year for the holiday season I want to do something a little different so I've been asking my grandma for recipes she remembers growing up with down on her farm and these molasses crinkles or when the first one she remembers her mom making I can't wait to show you all how to do it this is the perfect recipe for the beginner Baker let's get started with 3/4 cup of vegetable shortening and 1 cup of packed light brown sugar I'm using the electric mixer if you don't have one don't worry a hand mixer or just stirring it by hand will work just fine we're gonna cream the sugar and shortening start your mixer on medium low for around 2 minutes until it gets light and fluffy scrape down the sides of the bowl now add 1/4 cup of molasses this is a full flavor molasses the molasses is what gives these cookies their distinct flavor really to me reminiscent of old-time Christmases add one egg I always like to crack it in a bowl just in case any of the shell gets in it it's a lot easier to give out a little bowl than out of a big mixer bowl mix well with the molasses and egg added in between each addition scrape down the sides just ensuring all the ingredients is evenly incorporated you don't want any weird bits to get into the cookies now I'm gonna sift all the dry ingredients I have a colander sitting in a bowl that I can sit directly into makes for easy work two cups of flour one and a half teaspoons of baking soda and now the fun part is all the slices great grandma had written on her recipe this is the perfect amount of spices I love to see what people used to write on their recipes it's one teaspoon of high-quality cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and now just 1/4 teaspoon of salt salt always brings out the sweetness and any baked good now just sift them all through the colander and see why we always do it you get all those little bits that you don't want in your cookies and you're ready to go after the dry ingredients is sifted we just add it right to the bowl of the wet you can see the dough comes together it's quite a dry dough now put the dough into a bowl to chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight once it's chilled we can begin to bake the cookies I always use an ice cream scoop to make my cookies mix them all the same size and they're perfectly uniform using my 1 ounce scoop I make a ball and quickly roll lightly in my hands then dunk half of it in water and then in sugar the water just ensures it sticks to the top you have your choice of what kind of sugar you want to use you can either use a regular white granulated sugar or this turbinado sugar which is a raw sugar and has a little bit larger granulars or for the holidays use a colored sugar once the pan is full and bake at 375 for 12 minutes I pulled the cookies out of the oven and let them sit on the pan and finish baking for about 5 minutes now I'm just going to transfer them to a rack you can see as the sugar bakes on top it forms this great crust that almost looks like frosting the turbinado is the darker and the granulated stays it's white as these cookies cool they'll be just crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle I hope you're as excited about the starting of the holiday baking season as we are here at the gray boxwood these are the perfect cookie to start off with they're quick simple and delicious happy holidays", "EyP4DFt9WnY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "Sc6T53NKfpc": "molasses cookies are a delicious family favorite take a minute to learn how to make them we have here four and a half cups of flour the first thing we're gonna add is baking soda four teaspoons of ginger a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground cloves so all those spices are what give the cookie like it's delicious taste right what I've got in here is a cup and a half of shortening and we're gonna beat this until it's fluffy nice and that's a half cup of molasses 2 cup sugar mix that add just a little bit at a time okay [Music] oh cool so this is the kind of touch I like to take how about you a a honor roll", "X6QefobJIbc": "okay well now I gotta get the icing went down to the tip here it's gonna take forever so stand by hey everyone its Lauren toda from hot for food and I'm so excited because it's almost Christmas only two more sleeps and I'm part of the second annual kin community cookie collabo with so many other kin community creators and there's lots of yummy cookie recipes to check out at the end of this video look at these ones from joyous health these yummy chocolate ones from all-natural 28 and if you want to go real over-the-top make sure you check out these ones from how to cake it everyone's recipes are so delicious but today I'm gonna show you how to make vegan gingerbread snowflakes they're easy to make and they taste just like the gingerbread cookies you grew up with so to start you're gonna need two bowls a large bowl and kind of a medium sized Bowl for the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients first we're gonna start by sifting together the dry ingredients which is two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour and a teaspoon of baking soda along with three teaspoons of ground ginger two teaspoons of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground cloves and a quarter teaspoon of fine sea salt then give that a stir and set it aside while you prepare the wet ingredients so when you know you're gonna make the cookies just in the morning take out your vegan butter and you're gonna let it sit at room temperature so that it's soft so we're starting with 1/2 a cup of vegan butter you're gonna beat the vegan butter with 1 cup of packed brown sugar and beat that till it's nice and fluffy with a hand mixer once the vegan butter and sugar is all fluffy then you're gonna add 1/4 cup of non-dairy milk and I'm using almond milk but you could also use soy milk you're also going to add 1/4 cup of unsalted molasses and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and then beat again until the reserved okay now you're gonna add all of the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and now fold this together until it forms a dough at this point once it comes together I would just use your hands knead it a little bit to get it mixed now you don't over mix it so once you see that it's well combined just make sure it all lifts off the side like this just take a piece of plastic wrap put it on your counter I have formed a ball of dough now if you're in a warmer climate or your room is really hot your dough might be softer in which case do not add more flour just spoon it out onto the plastic wrap until it's like a pile of dough and then kind of just form the ball like this with the plastic wrap you don't want to add more flour because you're gonna be doing that as you roll out the dough plus it's gonna harden and get cold in the fridge and that's gonna resolidify the butter so wrap this up and then refrigerate it for about 45 minutes to one hour so just before your dough is done in the refrigerator make sure you pre-heat your oven to 350 and then remove the dough from the fridge and cut it in half so you can work with a smaller portion so just wrap this one up and leave it in the fridge and work with this piece you're gonna flour the whole counter your rolling pin and your cookie cutters you're rolling the dough out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch or slightly less make sure your cookie cutter is flour so once your first batch is cut out have parchment lined baking sheets standing by and transfer them from your floured surface here onto your baking sheets then take this excess knead it back together a couple times re flour the surface and roll it out again so keep doing this until there's no dough left so this is the first half of the dough you can bake these and start rolling out the other ones there are six to eight minutes at 350 and then you just have to transfer them to a wire rack pretty immediately right out of the oven to let them cool okay now you have lots of cookies but you have to let them cool completely before you start icing so mine ready to go I'm going to set them aside and I'll show you how to make piping icing and then if you want to get kind of fancy you can do flood icing with piped icing on top okay so for the icing you're gonna need that big mixing bowl again and your hand mixer or you can use a whisk you're gonna start with two and a quarter cups of icing sugar and three tablespoons of warm water so this is kind of like the perfect piping icing cuz it's stiff and you can make thin lines and design your snowflakes without the icing like dripping take about a third of this icing that you've just made and put it in another Bowl and then add a little bit of food coloring piping icing isn't as hard as you might think and I like to actually use these little dollar-store squeeze bottles makes things easier but you can also buy like piping icing kits that come with the bags and the tips and if you want to keep things simple just make your one or two colors pipe the icing you're gonna get all the cookies something like this but you saw that I was outlining some of the cookies and what we're gonna do there is make another batch of icing which is the same amount of ingredients two and a quarter cups of icing sugar but instead of three tablespoons of warm water you're going to add an extra tablespoon making it four tablespoons of water and that's a thinner icing so you're gonna flood the cookies by spreading the thinner icing all the way to the outline that you piped earlier so then after you've flooded you can go in with your piping icing and make a design there they are vegan gingerbread snowflakes now of course you could make any shapes you want out of the gingerbread dough so go ahead and have fun making them with your friends and family and make them just in time for Christmas only two sweeps left be sure to watch the rest of the cookie collaboration videos at the end of this video and that's it from our food this week stay tuned because next Wednesday we'll have a brand new video for you and it's just in time for New Year's Eve it's something special so make sure you watch that subscribe

inside of me i'm gonna make ginger molasses cookies they're so good perfect usually i make these around christmas time but in this house october through december is one clump of time better known as the best time of the year so i might as well just treat it all equally and there's no time like the present these cookies are so delicious they make my grandmother want to fall into a diabetic coma just to have one more so be careful you've been warned no one likes a grammy killer i'm going to put all the measurements down below in the description create your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit now that that's done let's bake going to start with the dry ingredients so in a medium sized bowl get yourself some all-purpose flour add some baking soda salt and our spices in here i have some cinnamon freshly grated nutmeg cardamom and some allspice very delicious give this a good whisk around distribute those spices evenly now for the wet ingredients into another bowl we're going to put our vegetable oil and the molasses fun little trick put your oil into the vessel before you put anything sticky nothing sticks you get it all and brown sugar almost forgot need the egg one egg get your whisk and do the hokey pokey move it all around incorporate that egg until you get one large beautiful blob now we're going to put the wet into the dry mix it all in you want to incorporate all that flour you don't want to see anything loose in there and you're going to kind of get a stiffer dough but it's still very soft but you're able to you know roll it up and it forms a little ball that's what we want these are ready to go now for the extra special delicious beautiful part these are rolled cookies i have some white sugar here in a bowl got my little ice cream scoop and roll away drop them in the sugar coat them well here we go see a little ball place them on your baking sheet and you just keep on going these are going to go into my preheated 350 degree oven check them very frequently they take about eight to nine minutes i always start checking at five just in case but you want them to be just the slightest bit brown on the bottom there they might look puffy right away but as soon as you take them out let them cool just for a few minutes they're going to flatten a little more and they're going to start to crackle and look all kinds of pretty so see you in a few minutes here's the first batch these were in the oven for eight minutes see how this one's already starting to cool a little bit more and it's starting to crack a little bit more oh that's gonna be a good one if i tried to move these now they might just break apart so we're just gonna wait a second these are the last of them it's funny like each batch looks different my first ones are quite light not as crackly the second batch was much darker much more crackly i mean look at that and the third batch came out even darker and the cracks are happening so i don't understand the oven but it's all good they all look delicious they smell unbelievable i got like 23 cookies out of this which breaks my heart that it couldn't have been 24 but these are much bigger than i usually cook them and my scoop was about two tablespoons so if you just did one tablespoon you could get a lot of cookies out of this recipe now i want to eat some this one looks good to me look at all the crackles and see how they flattened out just a little bit but they're still super soft and they'll stay soft unless you leave them kind of out in the open these will last probably a few days in like an airtight container if they last that long good luck but they're they're so good and they're still kind of warm so and look they're just like so soft still oh look at the inside of that um oh yeah these taste like fall and i didn't even have to put my head into a pumpkin like usual like joey trivia style you know when he puts his head in the turkey never mind that coating of sugar on the outside makes it really nice and crunchy on the outside but they are super super soft on the inside definitely make these and enjoy them", "exUOotBlzXY": "[Music] do [Music] my [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music]

homegrown and something old-fashioned and keep our minds off what's been happening lately so we're going to make crisp molasses cookies and they are just that they are crisp molasses cookies so this recipe I mentioned my mother-in-law Marie so often because she was just as you well know she was just a wonderful wonderful woman and she had these cookies there was just an endless pit of these crisp molasses cookies every time I would go there and she would always have the teapot on and have a cookie ante and we called them dunkers because they're hard cookies and they're grape split in half and dipped in hot tea or nice cold glass of milk so the first thing that I'm going to do I want you to make sure your hands are nice and clean I'm gonna go wash my hands right now and I want you to turn your oven on 375 and as well pre-measure one thing pre measure 2 cups of flour in in a in a bowl like this okay and we'll get to that later so be right back all right how's everybody doing I can't even see the comments because I'm doing this at the table and it's on the other side of the table and these are reading glasses they can't reach out that far so they're all of the children are out there everybody's doing something and they're going to answer any questions that you may have put up on the live feed and telling me that everything is all set to go okay just checking make sure everything is okay here ok I think we're good to go alright gonna start the recipe with 3/4 cup of shortening so everybody I'm gonna bake it right along with you except this is pre-measured so 3/4 cups of shortening [Music] all right so is everybody at this point 3/4 cups of shortening and just cream the shortening squash it down [Music] and it seems to be just perfect now you're gonna add one cup of sugar I have two half cup measures here so one cup and just mix that with the shortening perfect now so you've got a cup of sugar and 3/4 cups of shortening here I'm going to need an egg I'm going to go get mine out of the fridge drop that in there and at this time I not don't bother stirring that we're gonna put the molasses in now so I have my cross piece molasses and I have my 1/4 cup measure and I always do this so I'm just gonna do it with you - I I hate how the molasses sticks to the sides of everything about a measuring note so I just lose a little spray when one heard the recipe and just spray like that and fill it [Music] a nice even 1/4 cup okay the smell of molasses so really it's pretty nice and clean when you use that little trick you know I was talking to an old boss of mine just this past week and his name is Edgar J son hi Edgar if you're watching but Edgar was telling me about back in the the days of the depression I don't even know when that was years I'm whatever but molasses was just a real thing to have is it was one of the staples of the people you can hope you're all stirring this and so the farmers they would mix the molasses with with the oats and whatever they else that they gave the cattle and so the farmers could get it more easily and they at that time they kind of used the same molasses that we use for cooking so they would order extra because they were allowed to have it and the the households would anybody who had extra molasses or whatever would share it with the women who needed it for for cooking because we don't know you know how how lucky we are we're I hope we're not going to be in a depression but anyway I did not know that back in the day okay that's nicely mixed and you see that is yours just like that okay so that's all to that part and now it's just the dry ingredients okay so you pre-measured two cups of flour so put your flour in you're gonna put everything in at the same time 1 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon you can measure I just I have a very good idea of what a teaspoon is so I always measure it in the palm of my hand and baking powder 2 teaspoons I always measure the baking powder 1 and now you're going to need the 3 spices that I gave you the directions to make sure you have so we're going to put 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon cloves and ginger okay so this is my cinnamon I have my felch scg on from the interpretive center in genetic all the errors and waltzes that I absolutely love it's just uh it's that kind of a day okay this is my ginger oh love the smell of these spices and cloves 1 teaspoon of cloves wolves are strong and some people need like less of that but I just put the whole thing in because that's how my mother-in-law gave me the recipe stick to that and the cookies are so good okay now I'm just gonna mix that the top part kind of around before I start mixing it through the whole batter but if you get a chance what before you bake that I put some white sugar in a little dish here just to have on the side we'll use it for dipping the batter in after but just know that we're going to have to do that okay so now just mix your batter absolutely good I hope you all have your oven preheating to 375 and [Music] I'm just I have my cookie sheets already with parchment paper on it you do what you like best how you want to do that I I just love parchment paper and you know attachment paper can be used for so many things it's so great to put in any dish when you're baking especially meats you know how you're when you're cooking like chicken breasts and you have a maybe a coating on it and it sticks to the pan and yet soak it if you just have to put it on parchment paper you don't have to worry and it's really a good idea when you use parchment paper to cut what you need but then fold all the ends so that the perfect paper is flat in your pan and I'll just show you what I did this is what I mean by flat in Japan so I fold it over a crease there the reason for that is say if you were making the cinnamon rolls like many you have done if you have your it's a 425-degree oven for the for when I cook it in mice and the ends of the parchment paper will be scorched they don't get scorched scorched if you if you fold it under and parchment paper really has the highest temperature that it really should be go with used in your oven is at least the pack I have it's 420 degrees so you wouldn't use it for anything other than that okay mine is nice and mixed like that as yours like that you see that okay and that that's really this is gonna be a short one this is all there is hey just checking maturely kids aren't texting me somebody just did okay I think we're okay and you end up with a nice big ball of dough okay so I'm gonna keep it in my bowl here I'm gonna take my cookie sheet over so I can hope you you have your cookie sheet already now you're going to take a ball I have to use a similar tool like a ping pong ball size you know like that and you're gonna roll it around now as you're rolling it around sometimes you can feel it you know it's kind of separating in the middle if you push hard enough and then roll it that will disappear and you roll it just like a ball like that and your little finger sugar you're going to dip it in the sugar just like that and then sugar side up you're going to put it on your cookie sheet okay continue doing that until you have 12 on your sheet okay and then we're going to squash it down with fork [Music] this recipe probably makes around two dozen or maybe a couple more I cannot tell you how many times I've made this recipe it's so quick and it's so easy and smells so good when you take them out of the oven and you're just leaving them on the pan to cool I just leave them on the pan that they kind of just settle down you know otherwise you can take them off too soon and you put them on on a cookie rack it'll take the mark up the cookie rack because it's still just trying to form right [Music] there now I got a lot of requests well not a lot a lot but a few requests after I had announced that they're going to make the molasses cookies so many people were looking for the fat Archie cookie recipe of course I only make what I like and what the kids like and grandkids like I was never a fan of the soft big soft molasses cookie never really liked it and the fat Archie I gave it to a few people because I have it I there's a local cookbook here and there's a was a fine lady to him there that was pretty good at making federer chip cookies and so I gave that recipe to a couple of people so that's your preference and she had it on there that you could drop it by spoonfuls on on your cookie sheet but if you wanted to you might add a tiny little bit more flour and roll it out and cut them like big like that that's up to you alright so there's my cookies and I'm going to take a fork you can make whatever design you want you can just you you know you can push it down with the palm of your hand if you don't want the fork mark on it and just push it down until it's flat or you can just do what I do I just do one push down on each one this is this is one thing that the kids would like to do if there's any young people cooking today I hope you are cooking with mom and dad and you can push down your own design and and you can crisscross as well if you like it like that I'm just used to doing it this way it's easier so there that's what it looks like I'm going to put mine in the oven now and I'm going to time it for about 11 minutes in my oven so we'll just watch it you just it's hard to tell with the color off the molasses cookie but they get a tiny bit brown that you can see okay so give this a go I'm gonna put these in the oven and I have another cookie sheet ready here so I'm just gonna go and and form those Odin I put my kettle on all right have to have tea and these are all cooked you know when you when you live in a small in a small town we're not even a town like this brick community there's a new no village status I'm not even sure I should know that but I don't okay can't see you Tammy this is not coming up for me I know Tammy is there she is okay so I'm just going to review review the recipe so you've got 3/4 cups of shortening mix that up add a cup of sugar and then you're gonna add an egg and 1/4 cup of molasses mix that all up add 2 cups of flour a teaspoon of salt 2 teaspoons of baking powder and then you've got a teaspoon each of cloves ginger and cinnamon now I have made these plenty times when I was missing one of those spices but you know what they are just fine don't you have a couple of them you're fine say the clothes is a strong strong one if you don't want that that's fine so cookies they're gonna be perfect no matter so that's two dozen cookies in this pan with this pan and what's in the oven and there's still some Joel left I'm going to leave the rest of it I'll make them after please deal with before and I'll do the rest of them later so I have this one ready to go I hope you're all at the same point as I am we have the sun shining here today for two days in a row we have had the Sun and hope of spring it's almost at the end of April when I look at the weather forecast and they're saying there's gonna be snow coming tonight can't believe that so it's kind of you just have to go with it we could be somewhere where there's big hurricanes so Perth tornadoes we're we're in a pretty safe spot here okay I'm just gonna put this over on the counter there yeah I can see you all now okay I'm gonna take you with me hi Sharon Woodstock from Ontario how are you doing I want to sit you down here with me you know I thought I had this camera thing all figured out I tested it with my son sideways it was just perfect no at the last minute it didn't work so you got me in portrait style instead of landscape but it's okay 95 degrees Fahrenheit they're in Santa Clarita whoa that is hot oh you guys you're pretty special you're pretty special to me I'll tell you this just has given me a a new life just enjoying reading the messages and trying to reply to all the inbox messages even though I have help sometimes thank God the kids are able to help because I just I'm so amazed and hi Kevin somebody's saying my hair is the cutest oh my god I took the scissor to it myself because it was getting in my eyes and you don't want to see the mistakes anyway it is what it is okay the kettle boiled I'm gonna go put the tea on and then we're gonna have a little visit okay just one second [Music] [Music] okay I have a book five minutes left and my my cookies so a few things I'd like to visit with you about this wanna have somebody to talk to and and share share with and this past week aside from all of the other stuff that's been going on I I wanted to say a big thank you to so many of you because I mentioned Heather down to you who is from Ontario and is an author and is publishing a book by the end of May and she describes the book is something similar to as you know Chicken Soup for the Soul inspiring stories that came out of this Cove at 19 at that time and I asked you last week to maybe reach out to her because she had interviewed me about tools and wooden spoons and you know people baking with me and just you know just deviating from the regular world that they're in and just kind of getting away from the whole outside world and the media and all of that and and there's a comfort in that and so anyway you did that so many of you reached out to her and sent her beautiful emails and she told me about them and she's I think pretty well finished my little part in that whole book so I'll be certainly - to put that out to all of you guys when I know that it is ready but it would be for a while anyway and the other thing I wanted to say I want to say a big big big hello to Kitty heike if you are watching I'll tell you who's this special person is on Monday last week I think it was Thursday what's at Friday I think it was Friday I had an an online interview for a show that larch Sudberry were doing with some of their core members and so Kitty was there and she had baked the cinnamon rolls and she was just so excited to meet me as I was to meet her and they watch all the time and she was just a sweetheart and she was singing at the end she's sang Amazing Grace for Nova Scotia and she she has a beautiful voice and it was just so nice so if you're watching today Kitty I I just love you and thank you so much for speaking with me on that little interview was very special and another thing that's kind of exciting that's happening this week or anybody here in any any of you are out there in Canada see TV in the morning on your morning it's called out of Toronto it's a national show in the morning I think it starts at maybe 7:00 a.m. and I don't know when it airs everywhere but it's the show that Ben Mulroney is on and the two gals so I am going to be talking to Ben Mulroney about this cinnamon rolls and this whole a little movement that has started with the home baking so that's pretty special so that's supposed to be Tuesday morning if nothing changes that's you know so maybe you'll you'll will have a little listen or watch on on CTV on Tuesday morning I think the cookies are ready my timers beeping god bless the timers because if I didn't have it I'd be burning everything can you see them oh my god they smell so good so I'm just gonna put them on the cooling rack but for a few minutes before I get my tea okay and so I put them on the cooling rack and I want to show it again to Sonia Boyd in Antigonish the pampered chef lady she's so nice and she sent me another little package of nice things and utensils so pretty special people out there so Thank You Sonia very much but anyway okay we talked about CTV I have a little few notes here to remind me what I was going to tell you but yeah that's pretty exciting with with the morning show there I'm very very happy with that and you know what just have to go with the flow and see what happens but another exciting thing that's happened with all of these children that we have they're all taking an active role in in grandma's venture here so we've got you know the Facebook page we have Instagram we have twitter we have YouTube and they're all of course under Tunes and wooden spoons and all the recipes are there but one more thing that we're doing is a website and where it's of course toons and wooden spoons calm but it's not not ready yet it could be ready in the next day or so but another exciting part of that whole thing the course the recipes will be on there in PDF format so that you'll be able to print them as we as we go through every week and and that's what I really wanted because there were so many people that weren't finding the recipes couldn't see them whatever and this would make it easier for you but that's not to say that down the road we might just have a cookbook that you can purchase but there is something that you might be able to purchase so you know this lovely apron that I wear made by Brenna from Miss Brenna and you can just google miss Brenna and you'll find her website and it's a I love Cape Breton dossier so with Brenna's help and with my niece Margie Beaton's help with artwork and everybody and they developed a logo and it's nice big like a cup of tea and it says tunes and wooden spoons so we're gonna be selling aprons and if we don't have the whole store part set up just yet but it's a red apron it's going to be the same business and I mean Brenna and still ordered for Brenna if you want the Cape Breton thing just I love that girl and all her work that she's put into her hoodies and just so many items and hats just a great gal but she's helping me with with my own little apron that's gonna say tunes and wooden spoons on it with a teacup and some music notes and a wooden spoon and all of that stuff it's just so cute and so we're gonna have that for sale but not not sure of all the details exactly just yet and they won't be here for another two to three weeks and but if you're interested for now see if you're interested in Lauda aprons I only ordered I didn't know if people would be many would be interested but we ordered a few and if you just want to send an email to tunes and wooden spoons at gmail.com and express your interest I'll put you on that in a spreadsheet and and and we'll get back to you when we know all the details they'll they'll be selling for $25 plus shipping and handling maybe you know it was in Canada $5 we'll cover that but a portion of it a portion of it is going to go to our son Mitchell has this bursary that he started at our local school and our son Mitchell of course it so musically inclined and remember what's in Canadian Idol and he just wanted to give back to the community in some way so he started this bursary and last year was the first bursary that was was given out and it ended up he had enough money in from his open mic nights here in Port hood at the clove hitch bar and bistro right here in Port hood he saved all of those with the manager and all of that money and it was some money was given by by the clove hitch as well as well as well as long a McQuade and the music company to help towards this bursary so we're able to give out to $1000 bursaries to two wonderful wantedly talented young men at the high school and it's they I think they each got maybe both of them got a new guitar and one of them's in a band and see the the year before last Mitchell played all that summer at the open mikes on Friday nights at the clove hitch bar and bistro and he had a tip jar but every bit of the money in there was kept by the manager and it was to go towards this and so then last summer he he's still doing it every Friday night and going towards this year's bursary but now this summer it doesn't look like he's going to be able to to make that work because I don't think they leave many open mikes unless we get a big big change in our kovat 19 status and so a portion of of the the proceeds of this apron sales are going I'm going to give that to Mitchell to put in that little pot in the hope that we want to keep this going I want to encourage music wherever possible so so that's that's pretty nice okay I put my other pan of cookies in and they're just about done so I'm going to go pour my tea and we'll have our last little visit and a little taste test okay just hold on a second so I've got four more minutes and in that next batch so today's kind of a mug kind of day you know how you want to take a mug and just hold on to it and this is my course my Cape Breton mug made by Colton MacDonell former stepdance student of mine and just a beautiful person working in healthcare system and in Nova Scotia and I have a couple of styles of his mug and we gave one of these to every one of the kids one Christmas there a couple of Christmases ago and it's a it's a treasure to them and they love the coffee and I love my tea so I'm just gonna have a little sip of tea so nice and hot I was doing so much talking that the tea almost boiled and that would be a tragedy if you had boil tea my papa who raised me we had we had a you know cold wood stove back in the day you know going back and fifties or sixties the tea pot was always on this top of the stove and it was okay if it boiled and those are the days of loose tea and we're kind of coming back to that people kind of prefer that as well but of course I'm a tea bag person and I love my King Cole tea from Sussex New Brunswick love it have another look at little peace little we call it a little stir ooh buck a stroke of tea that's a little Gaelic expression I don't know I guess it's a little sip I don't know what's through buck means but I was raised with parents or am i they were they raised me they weren't my real parents but they were their first language was Gaelic and they had all of these little sayings that I would pick up on right anyway this is delicious okay the taste test now they're not that crisp and hard right now because they're still kind of warm but they're good some I dare not dunk this one but when they're nice and hard they dunk really good as tomorrow they'll be cracky her I'd like a ginger snap almost but thicker oh I think of my mother-in-law every time I make these because they're called in my recipe wherever it is I always go by my recipe it's Port hood grandmas that was her we I was born in ma boo and I moved to Port hood just ten kilometers in the difference so our kids grew up with ma boo grandma and Port hood grandma so this was Port hood grandma anyway okay I got to get that other batch of cookies out and I still have a couple of things to tell you about okay now I just want to tell you a little exciting news that we're so excited about our daughter one of our identical twins Kelly she doesn't know I'm saying this hi Kelly I'm sure she's watching she's due to have her first baby this coming Friday and we're we're so excited you know like I said we had seven children Tami Brennan Maggie Gordy and when Gordy was 15 months old we welcomed identical twin girls into the house and then five years later we welcomed the baby Mitchell and no Tami Brennan Maggie Gordy they were you know just like normal kids easy to go and whatever and then the twins came along and when they got motoring there was no stopping them just ask my neighbors Leo and Cassie honest to God did run down the road naked as a jaybird you know two years old just that strip off their clothes and run down the road and you run catch them and I mean we're on it back kind of a back roar world too was not like there was traffic don't think I'm that bad a parent but I'll just tell you one funny story of them growing up you know they they were always challenging us so one Sunday morning we were we're going to church on Sunday morning trying to get all seven of them out was just a chore sometimes so I don't know how old they were I probably five I'm seeing gonna say five around that four or five or six somewhere around there and Kelly Duggar feeding and she said no I don't want to go she wanted to stay home and play or whatever and my husband said but you're probably not supposed to say he said if you don't go to church with us God is gonna punish you anyway as it went along she went to church with all with all of us and we went to church and we came back home from church and of course we were making dinner I guess mr. making dinner and of course you just scooted all the kids outside to play so we on our yard we have lots of trees we have one big tree it's a big old chestnut tree so they were all out there playing and all sudden we heard the crying go run out and krysta the kelly's twin had fallen out of the tree and it was very obvious that she had broken her wrist so I stayed home with the kids and Cecil took them to the hospital on the way to the hospital and in tears krysta was in tears and she said crying do you think God got us mixed up and punished the wrong twin oh my god I love that I loved that little story I remember that so well when Cesar came home and told me that and because there so many people could not tell them apart and they figured that God couldn't either because he couldn't tell them apart so he might punish krysta it's dead anyway there's so many good stories and so many little things that happened when when the kids were growing up and I remember one last story of course the wooden spoons right the wooden spoons were used to threaten and you don't be good by God you know what's gonna happen and so and and of course I come from a time when you gave them a little crack on the rear end if they weren't good you can't do that now but anyway I remember threatening them with the wooden spoon this one day and I read they were fighting chasing one another all over the house and I took the wooden spoon and I cracked it on the table to tell them to be good and they were all crying and mad at one another and and chasing and I could when I cracked the table the wooden spoon went in pieces everywhere and the giggle and that was the end of everybody being mad and the end of me being mad too but that's that's what life was like in in in a house full of little ones and I wouldn't trade it for the world I'd like to go back and be but maybe a better mom but anyway it was it was what it was and it is what it is okay I'm gonna sign off now I hope it didn't forget to tell you something that I should have all the recipe should be up on the Facebook page now and on Instagram but 3/4 cups of shortening and a cup of sugar and an egg and quarter cup of molasses two cups of sugar about two cups of flour and two teaspoons of baking powder a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of each of the three spices cinnamon cloves and ginger 375 for 11 minutes in

you now I just love looking forward to Sundays and having a little visit with you take care love you all love one another you", "n3Fs9_W4tMc": "hi today I'm going to be making soft molasses cookies we start with 3/4 cups of shortening 1 cup of packed brown sugar you need a half a cup of white sugar but you put that aside that's for later to roll your cookie dough in 1 egg 1/2 a cup of molasses 2 and a half cups of flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt I have a bunch of stuff in this bowl so 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 2 teaspoons of baking soda nobody can tell and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon the first thing you do is you're going to cream together the shortening the brown sugar and when that's done I'll show you what it looks like so once that's done you're going to add your egg and your molasses and again you're going to mix this all up ok so once that's once you've added the egg and the molasses you're going to fold in the flour the salt the baking soda and the cinnamon I just added everything to the flour to make it easier and then do a little bit at a time and then just fold it in due to my accident my shoulder I can't my right shoulder can't be move very much so I ended up them I ended up switching over to the mixer and I can use my left tan for that so once that's all mixed you're going to refrigerate you're going to cover it with saran wrap or some kind of cling wrap and chill in the fridge for one to two hours now the oven is for you to 300 is preheating rather just 350 degrees this is after two hours or so of being chilled you make small bowls small bowls that's not right is this that just shake your head you can say no and you're gonna roll them in the shirt but you put aside earlier and then you just take them and put them on the cookie sheet you get better there okay then you cook them for home does it say nine to ten minutes um double check with your other minds a little funky so I'll start checking them probably about seven minutes let them cool on the cookie sheet for one minute after you take them out of the oven before removing them and putting them on the iron rack to cool I'll show you what they look like when they come into the oven okay so my daughter informed me I said iron racks and basically it's a wire racks also the cookies either can be put on parchment paper like I have here or lightly greased pan cookie sheets and when they're all nicely baked so from this to this and they're very good please like and subscribe to my videos and enjoy your weekend", "EOEXlK-BX_I": "hi it's Jodi today I'll be making soft ginger molasses cookies so for our cookies to start off with will preheat our oven to 375 degrees we'll also line two or three baking sheets with parchment paper okay now we'll start off with I've put three quarters of a cup of soft butter into my bowl to this I'll add one cup of brown sugar firmly packed okay and we'll start beating now really good and with the father [Music] like Amy till it's all incorporated okay now to this we're gonna add our molasses so we're gonna add a quarter cup of molasses and to my measuring cup I've sprayed it with a little nonstick cooking spray because this makes it easier for the molasses to come out because it's really quite thick so we'll just measure that in like so that's a quarter cup and there I'll just pour that into our mixing bowl just put that there just give it a little scrape there it comes out really easy okay now we won't continue I'm going to add of water turn our mixer off now I can't do this with one hand so to this we're going to add two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour okay now to this I will add one teaspoon of cinnamon two teaspoons of ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of baking soda there and now we'll mix this all up until it's all in oh it's not so bad spice see these are really may not get the functional everything okay and then we'll continue on with our cookies now for our cookies I've done mixing everything it's all come together nice okay all I've got now you don't have to use this kind of sugar it's turbinado sugar it's a really coarse um sugar but I like dipping my cookies into but if you don't have this you can just use regular white granulated sugar if you want to go out and get some of this you can find it in at the bulk barn actually that's where I pick it up okay so I've got a 1/8 of a cup measure here this is one of those handy dandy ice cream scoops which I totally love if you don't have one of these then just use your eighth of a cup measuring cup okay so I just go like so and then I just put it directly into our sugar okay like that you don't want to overcrowd so I've got I've got just four in here okay and then I go in make sure your hands are clean of course I roll these into a nice ball and then into the sugar okay and then I place it on my sheet pan so take your cookies roll them into a bowl and this kind of really pushes the sugar in as well mmm and then onto our sheet pan okay and again you just roll roll it in the sugar like so and this sugar gives a nice little crunch to the cookies like I said if you don't have it the regular granulated sugar works absolutely fabulous as well okay so I'm going to continue on rolling our cookies and I'll show you when it's all done so now I've got all the cookies rolled out and on our sheet pan it actually made 17 cookies now I'll just take the back of a measuring cup and I'll just flatten them ever so slightly just a little pressure on them okay just like that just a little tooth okay you don't want them flat just a little so you're just kind of flattening the top see just like that so now we're going to put them into the oven 375 now for eight to ten minutes okay start off with the eight minutes and then check them and see where they're at okay the timer has gone off for eight minutes and I'm just gonna give them a little chop you know what there's still a little soft inside so I'm gonna put them back into the oven now for the two minutes okay because we don't wanna overcook them okay we'll be back in two minutes to give them a check here you go cookies are done out of the oven in 12 minutes don't they look delicious I love these cookies let's give them a try see they're still a little bit soft just how we like them look at that doesn't that look good let's give it a try mmm these are one of my favourite cookies and you know what they taste awesome this time of the year but you can happen any time of the year as far as I'm concerned so there you go enjoy them now or put them in the freezer and take them out as you'd like enjoy", "FLKipiGQzso": "if you're looking for molasses cookies this video is for you my name is Emma your personal guide welcome to our channel at any time you can

"eUSk7RSHvLQ": "hi everybody wendy from cinnamon sweet shop today i'm going to be showing you how i make these molasses drop cookies so what makes this recipe different from your typical gingerbread cookie or spice cookie recipe is that we add some milk to it the ingredient list is whole wheat pastry flour i always use that but you can use all-purpose flour if you don't have that i also i'm using some light brown sugar you can use the swerve blend or the non-sugar natural sugar alternative blend i have some salt baking soda ground clove cinnamon ginger an egg melted butter molasses and i am using almond milk now you can use any kind of milk you would like as long as it's not a low-fat milk or a skim milk this is incredibly easy to make so i just have my flour add in all of those spices just put give this a quick whisk around just get the spices mixed in there then we're going to add in the brown sugar and then again get that pretty much well combined and then from there just going to add in the wet ingredients so i'll start with the egg the melted butter or in my case i use the fake butter doesn't really matter your milk and then the molasses just mix this by hand until it is thoroughly combined now you could use a mixer i just thought it's not that stiff of a dough so i'm not even going to bother dirtying up my my mixer wrap your dough in some plastic and refrigerate it for about an hour you can use tablespoon sizes and have larger cookies or half a tablespoon and of course have smaller cookies i have my a tablespoon worth it they're boiling it up this is purely optional but i am going to use some sanding sugar it makes it a little nicer looking and i'm going to roll each ball and then place it about an inch apart on a silicone baking mat bake these cookies for 12 minutes for three at a 375 degree oven so if you like this recipe subscribe to my youtube channel give it a thumb up and come on back for many more recipes craft ideas traveling that will be coming up in the near future", "hYp14nKFedg": "Hello!  Today we are making one of my all-time\u00a0\nfavorite Christmas cookies!  This recipe is\u00a0\u00a0 for gingerbread men.  And if you are not a fan\u00a0\nof gingerbread, I\u2019m here to change your mind.\u00a0\u00a0 This recipe comes from my sister-in-law Beth.  She's\u00a0\na phenomenal cook and I have had it published\u00a0\u00a0 online for four or five years.  And the reviews are\u00a0\nphenomenal!  If you are not a gingerbread lover this\u00a0\u00a0 recipe will change your mind!  It's soft, tender, the\u00a0\ntexture is phenomenal, the spices are just right.\u00a0 It's sweet but not so sweet that you don't want it\u00a0\nwith a cup of tea in the middle of the afternoon\u00a0\u00a0 while you're watching your favorite Christmas\u00a0\nmovies.  And it is just a joy to eat.  They're so\u00a0\u00a0 much fun. I actually sell them at the Christmas\u00a0\nfarmer's market and they do really, really well.\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone who eats these cookies loves them.  Another\u00a0thing that I like about these cookies is that you can decorate them.  But you do not have to decorate\u00a0them.  So if you want to and you have time you\u00a0\u00a0 can.  And if not, they're great standalone cookies.  And\u00a0\nthey're cute regardless and they hold their shape\u00a0\u00a0 very well.  So here's how you start - you just\u00a0\nneed a whole cup of butter, which is two\u00a0\u00a0 sticks, and it's at room temperature.  We're\u00a0\ngoing to add a cup of granulated sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 We're going to beat that together well until\u00a0\nit's nice and fluffy - it's about three minutes.\u00a0 After your butter and sugar are well\u00a0\ncombined, we're going to add an egg.\u00a0\u00a0 A whole cup of molasses - when it comes to molasses\u00a0\nyou are going to want to use unsulfured and not\u00a0\u00a0 backstrap molasses; because it's\u00a0\nbitter.  And if you are cooking\u00a0\u00a0 in Canada or the UK, this kind of\u00a0\nmolasses is called fancy molasses.\u00a0\u00a0 And it's not cooking molasses, because that also\u00a0\nwill lead to a bitter taste in your cookies.\u00a0 So people definitely prefer the fancy molasses or\u00a0\njust the unsulfured regular molasses in the US. And then secret ingredient - two\u00a0\ntablespoons of white vinegar.\u00a0 This adds to that texture and to some of\u00a0\nthe lifting and fluffiness in the dough. You're going to mix those together well.  And it\u00a0\nmight look a little bit curdled - that's really\u00a0\u00a0 normal.  That's because you added the vinegar.\u00a0\nSo next we're going to add five cups of flour.\u00a0\u00a0 It's fine to add it all at once.\u00a0\nAnd this is the salt and baking\u00a0\u00a0 soda, and then two teaspoons of ground ginger. A teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon\u00a0\nof cloves - this is my favorite spice\u00a0\u00a0 blend for these!  It's perfect!  And we're\u00a0\njust going to mix that together again.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, here's the texture of the dough.\u00a0\nAt this point it comes together.\u00a0 It's just a titch sticky.  It's not\u00a0\nterribly sticky.  It's a nice middle.\u00a0\u00a0 So it's about as soft as most traditional cookie\u00a0\ndoughs - if not a little bit stickier.  It's okay\u00a0\u00a0 if it is just a little bit tacky\u00a0\nbecause we're going to refrigerate it. And I like to stir it just a little bit\u00a0\nout of the KitchenAid, just because sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 the KitchenAid doesn't mix very well right in the\u00a0\nmiddle at the bottom of the beater.   And that just\u00a0\u00a0 makes sure that that spot isn't too wet or too\u00a0\ndry.  So a little bit sticks to my fingers, but not\u00a0\u00a0 tons.  So we're going to divide this into two.  Wrap\u00a0\nthem up well in plastic wrap and we're going to\u00a0\u00a0 refrigerate them for 30 to 90 minutes.  You can make\u00a0\nthis dough ahead of time.  It's fine in the fridge\u00a0\u00a0 for two or three days - which is awesome!  You can\u00a0\nmake it ahead of time.  Bake hot cookies when you\u00a0\u00a0 want them.  If you are going to put it in the fridge\u00a0\nlonger than that 30 to 90 minute window, just let\u00a0\u00a0 them rest on your counter for 15 to 20 minutes\u00a0\nbefore you roll them out.  Because they'll be really\u00a0\u00a0 stiff if they're that cold and then that will make\u00a0\nrolling them out easier.  Okay, my chilling time has\u00a0\u00a0 elapsed and now we are here.  You can use all kinds\u00a0\nof cookie cutters.  You do not have to commit to a\u00a0\u00a0 gingerbread man or woman or person.  And you can\u00a0\nuse any kind of cookie cutter you want because\u00a0\u00a0 they're really good.  And you can use all kinds\u00a0\nof size.  I have giant gingerbread people.  I have\u00a0\u00a0 smaller.  I have a whole set that's gradients like\u00a0\neight different ones and eight different sizes.  I\u00a0\u00a0 have a fun, a 16 year old who is... who made my recipe\u00a0\njust email me.  She did the stacked stars where\u00a0\u00a0 you have all the different shaped stars and you\u00a0\nstack them up and it looks like a Christmas tree.\u00a0\u00a0 She used this recipe for that and it turned out\u00a0\nbeautifully!  So you have a lot of options for this.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m just going to unwrap my dough.  See it's not\u00a0\ntoo firm, not too soft. It's right in the middle.\u00a0\u00a0 This has been sitting out about 20 minutes because\u00a0\nI had it in there longer than my 30. This is my\u00a0\u00a0 second batch.  I now have four giant pieces of\u00a0\ndough in my fridge.  My kids aren't sad about it.\u00a0\u00a0 So lightly flour your surface.  It doesn't\u00a0\nneed gobs, but you also don't want it to stick. So the beauty with this recipe is you can make\u00a0\nthe dough ahead of time.  You can keep it in the\u00a0\u00a0 fridge.  You can actually freeze the dough ahead of\u00a0\ntime.  It thaws really nicely.  And you can even make\u00a0\u00a0 the cookies all the way through baking.  You\u00a0\ncan bake them and you can freeze the baked\u00a0\u00a0 cookies.  That works super, super well too.  So\u00a0\nI always bake these ahead...  oops... it broke. I\u2019m\u00a0\u00a0 just going to work with half of it.  And I have a\u00a0\nbag made... baked in my freezer almost all winter\u00a0\u00a0 long.  I love having some extras.  Do you see?  This\u00a0\nis because it's cold.  It's cracking quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0 Let the heat of your hands warm that butter back\u00a0\nup.  Just press it back together.  It's not a big deal. See we don't have enough.  I\u00a0\nam going to put that back on. We're just going to fill in\u00a0\nour cracks with more dough. It is a little bit cold so\u00a0\nit's cracking quite a bit.\u00a0 So you want it to be about a half an\u00a0\ninch to a quarter of an inch thick.\u00a0\u00a0 I go right in between the two.  If not err on the\u00a0\nside of the half an inch, because I like them nice\u00a0\u00a0 and thick, because it keeps them soft and chewy.  And\u00a0\nthen I bake them for about 10 minutes.  If you like\u00a0\u00a0 them a little bit crisper, roll them a little\u00a0\nbit thinner and bake them a few minutes longer.\u00a0\u00a0 Or if you're doing something like the star tree, bake them a few minutes longer so that they're\u00a0\na little bit crisper, and I\u2019ll make them sturdier. Okay, I\u2019m going to do some mediums and some smalls. I wiggle my cookie cutter a little bit just\u00a0\nto make sure it went all the way through.\u00a0\u00a0 And he came out really nicely. And I still have some crack.  So I can either like\u00a0\navoid them with the cookie cutter; because, that one\u00a0\u00a0 was going to be right on his little head.  And so\u00a0\nI\u2019ll just make it go in between the cookie cutters.\u00a0\u00a0 Or you can use the heat of your fingers\u00a0\nand spread them out a little bit. Okay, I have my pan.  I\u2019m going to cook two pans at\u00a0\na time.  So this... I\u2019m actually going to re-knead it.\u00a0\u00a0 This is why I didn't want, like, too\u00a0\nmuch flour on it in the first place;\u00a0\u00a0 because, I just.. I\u2019m going to incorporate all of\u00a0\nit.  Don't work it a ton.  That was probably three\u00a0\u00a0 or four times folding it in half.  But then that\u00a0\njust makes this top a lot smoother to work with. Because all those pieces it looks like one, one\u00a0\ncohesive piece of dough.  If you just have all the\u00a0\u00a0 scraps together you'll see the lines where they\u00a0\noverlapped.  A little bit a little flour underneath.\u00a0\u00a0 And see this is warmed up.  So this is a\u00a0\nlot easier to roll than that first one. It didn't matter that it cracked.  It's\u00a0\njust a little bit harder to work with.\u00a0\u00a0 And a really thin metal spatula will\u00a0\ngo a really long ways if something starts\u00a0\u00a0 to stick a little bit on the\u00a0\ncounter.  That'll really save you.\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m going to bake these up.  If you're baking\u00a0\ntwo pans at a time, switch the pans from the top\u00a0\u00a0 rack... like... If you have one on the top and one on\u00a0\nthe bottom, switch them halfway through baking.  And\u00a0\u00a0 it might take a minute or so longer since there's\u00a0\ntwo pans and they're taking up the heat.  Again\u00a0\u00a0 I have a lot of luck baking them for exactly 10\u00a0\nminutes.  That's the texture that I like them at.\u00a0\u00a0 If they're not too thick.  These are not a half\u00a0\nan inch.  They are much closer to the quarter of\u00a0\u00a0 an inch.  So I\u2019m going to try nine minutes and\u00a0\nsee how they look.  So nine or ten minutes for\u00a0\u00a0 these thinner cookies, and if they were quite a bit\u00a0\nthicker you can bake them up to 14 or 15 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 Just all depends on the size; if you had this guy, if you\u00a0\ncut it out and it was quite thick it would take 15\u00a0\u00a0 minutes to bake.  So just bake them.  Get to where you\u00a0\nlike them.  And I\u2019ll show you what we do after that.\u00a0\u00a0 The first pan is out of the oven.  It's cooled for\u00a0\na few minutes on the pan.  And they\u00a0\u00a0 are beautiful!  They don't crack.  They don't spread!\u00a0\nThey puff up!  The texture is absolutely perfect!\u00a0\u00a0 Look how beautiful they are!  They're just perfect!\u00a0\nLittle.  But they're still tender.  Do you see that?\u00a0\u00a0 You can make little indents.  They're soft, perfectly\u00a0\nspiced.  I love this recipe! I can't wait for you\u00a0\u00a0 to make these this holiday season with your\u00a0\nfamily!  They're great to share with neighbors.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, I\u2019m Melissa Griffiths.

back to my channel today we are going to get ready for a cookie exchange that i'm doing tomorrow with my sisters we do every year i love it i'm going to share with you two of my favorite christmas cookie recipes so let's get started the first thing we're going to do is preheat your oven to 350 and then i have everything out that we're going to need um except another bowl that we are going to need out i'm doubling the recipe but the ingredients that i tell you are for one recipe so first we're going to do the dry ingredients you need 2 and 1 4 cup of flour now when i was trying to decide do i want to double this recipe then i thought about it for a second and i was like samara you have six children yes you want a double so um if you're doing a cookie exchange i would double the two because you do not want to give all of these cookies away they are so good this is a chewy cookie not a hard fruity gosh i make such a mess when i cook there's flour everywhere so two and a fourth cup and i'm going to have the recipe in the comments below so you can just go look down there if you don't want to write while i'm doing all of this so i if you want to double it then you're going to do four and a half cups of bar get me doing math so well that was homeschool good job mother and now we're gonna do two teaspoons of ground ginger i have used crushed ginger before tasted great so whatever you got then okay sorry two teaspoons oh my gosh i'm doubling it double double so four if you're doubling it then a teaspoon of baking soda so if you're doubling it you will do two teaspoons of baking soda are you guys ready for christmas we were not ready until yesterday my mother-in-law came and watched because thank you kathy so we could get some shopping done we literally had like maybe one or two things per child and yeah not that they need a ton of stuff but we were not ready okay so now cinnamon three-fourth a teaspoon of cinnamon i love to use essential oils when i can in my baking and cooking it just it just adds a little flavor so i'm going to do one teaspoon and then one drop into my wet ingredients i am out of ground cloves and so i'm going to have to grind some of my coffee grinder now for the clothes we need half a teaspoon so i'm gonna need one teaspoon and i'm going to have to i had this from a ham i made and i'm just gonna grind some up in a coffee grinder real quick [Applause] okay we needed half a teaspoon if you're doing a half of just one recipe a whole teaspoon if you're doing double now we're just going to stir these dry ingredients together now if you're fancy you could zip this i am not fancy honestly if this was not for a video i would probably put this all in one bowl and not do the dry ingredients separately but for you guys i am doing it separate look at me that's how much i love you okay now for the wet ingredients i don't know i'm trying to make it where you can see me but then i have to i can't see if you can see me okay so for a single recipe we need 3 4 cup of butter so that's to stick it in half if you're doubling it it's going to be three sticks of butter softened now my sister would just put this in the microwave in the packs why did i put it in the bowl i don't know i'm going with my way because i've already messed it up my sister is an amazing baker she actually did all the baking for a local coffee shop for a while and now she just does like orders on the side type thing she makes cakes she's amazing she makes my kids cake she has saved me hundreds upon hundreds of dollars for my kids cake alex i love you if you're watching okay so while that is going we're also going to get out a cup of sugar where's my sugar and put that in your mixer if you do not have a mixer um use a hand mixer you definitely are going to want some sort of mixer because we're going to oh my guys this depicts my life right here you think it's gonna go one way and it just takes you for a spin and you go somewhere you weren't ready to go oh gosh i haven't sleeping very well i don't know why so i've been up to like four in the morning several times this week and i'm a little loopy so a single recipe's one cup double recipe is two and then we're gonna put the butter in and we are going to let this go until it becomes fluffy again if you guys were not here i would just call this a day but we're going to try to do this thing right these are going to be your favorite christmas cookie i'm telling you they're so good so why that's going i'm going to go ahead and get our molasses ready for a single recipe it's a fourth of a cup but we're doing doubles so we're going to do half a cup of molasses this was kind of hard to find if you can't find it i found ours um in the oatmeal section like posters here but not right where the syrup was i hate molasses but i love these cookies and we're also going to get ready a single recipe would be one egg without pretty much that my chickens finally started laying eggs so happy so for a single recipe you're doing one egg double recipe you're doing two and then you also need a tablespoon of water or two tablespoons look at my wet ingredients all fancy with sugar everywhere okay so i've got this going and i'm going to slow it down just a bit and we're supposed to put these in until the mixture is smooth could we just take a second and talk about how stinking cute my measuring cups are my mom got me these they're pioneer woman from walmart oh my gosh look at my counter this was clean before i started aren't those cute there's a little drop of molasses in there that is not dirt just so you know so when i make cookies or anything i like to put everything out because i forget stuff like one of my kids will inevitably come in here and distract me and i'll forget something and i think that i forgot salt yep i sure did so if i have it all laid out then i'm going to remember if i didn't put something in we need a fourth a teaspoon of salt for a single recipe or a teaspoon if you are doubling you get it okay oh it smells like what okay so it smells like pumpkin pie i don't like pumpkin pie um i love these cookies you guys are gonna love these cookies now what we're gonna do is slowly add in our dry ingredients and combine all of this up oh i cannot wait to eat these cookies [Music] so i need to get some rubber spatulas i think because i could just scrape that guy out but this is almost done i'm just going to scrape the sides here [Music] wait a minute so i just want to say that if my kids were like i want to make cookies i would so let them help but if they're watching a movie right now and they're occupied i'm just gonna do this match by myself because then there will be another batch and someone will be here to help me and i need their help but sometimes it's nice to just do it by yourself get it done about six times quicker i love my children okay this is great so this is what it's going to look like so good every time i've made this same recipe the last three years for this cookie exchange because they're just delicious people like them i like them they might be my very favorite cookie ever and i love a good chocolate chip cookie um these are great so now i'm going to transfer these into another bowl so they can chill in the fridge the dough needs to chill just so it's easier to handle i get man i don't know if i normally do chill it i feel like i'm going to chill it i'm going to try to roll out a couple and then we'll see okay so as you can see i have helpers now surprise surprise we've all washed our hands i am going to spray my pants and you need a bowl of sugar and what you're going to do is roll out your balls and i'm using you don't have to use this this is just a melon baller thing this is just so the cookies are the same size i ended up just cleaning my counter while this was in the fridge so not very long um you roll out your ball that still looks a little big and then you roll it and sugar just leave it there and then you place it on the pan so i'm gonna do this quickly so you guys don't have to watch us do all of these cookies but just go ahead and roll them out [Music] do okay so now it's going in the 350 oven for 10 to 12 minutes knowing my oven it's going to be 15 but probably probably we will try and while you're waiting for these before 8 12 16 20. so there's 32 cookies so far so while you're waiting for these on this right so while you're waiting for those to bake you can go ahead and make these into the balls with the sugar and just have them on a plate ready to put on the cookie sheet when they come out okay so now i'm just going to take the cookies off of here and put them on a cooling rack you don't have to do this step if you don't want [Music] to okay so double batch made 53 cookies guys these cookies are so good okay so now we're making chocolate molasses espresso cookies i've never made these but they sounded super good what you need is you need instant coffee baking soda and egg hershey's powder those are just measuring cups some molasses a stick and a half of butter flour sugar and salt so i am gonna do this the easy way and just put everything together and see what happens so here we go yep here we go mama this is a super simple recipe first you're just gonna take your stick and a half of softened butter put it in there lay a cup of sugar i'm excited to try these normally i would double this like i said earlier but the kids i don't want to have a coffee anyways and we're almost out of butter so just worked out we're just going to do one and now we're going to put in two tablespoons of molasses two tablespoons of molasses are supposed to be really soft i'm excited to try these anything's happy right okay so now i'm gonna just combine this with the mixer and then we will add solids okay so as we just get ready to finish off these cookies you're gonna use a teaspoon of instant coffee any kind will do and then you're gonna have a teaspoon and a half of baking powder one and a half cups of flour and half a cup of cocoa this recipe is so simple oh yeah and a teaspoon of salt guys these were so good they're so soft and they just kind of melt in your mouth i'm gonna have the recipe in the description box below but i would definitely give these cookies a try [Music] okay so this is what it looks like it's supposed to be chilled for an hour up to three days time so i am going to put it in the fridge and finish these tomorrow it tastes good though it's interesting the combination of coffee and molasses flavor i'm excited to try these okay so it's the next day and i'm making up these mocha espresso cookies they look beautiful so all i did is i rolled them into balls and then we're gonna do the same thing that we did yesterday and roll them in sugar so you just roll them in sugar put them in there and then they're going to look like this i haven't tried them yeah you guys know what they taste like okay so you bake those at 350 for 10 minutes [Music] they're really good they're mommy you can't have a homemade baby honestly it reminds me of a brownie cookie it's good that recipe made 25

jenny ferris are here with me to do some holiday cocktailing and holiday baking uh and apparently chip is a an expert baker and basically so nailed it so we are making him do all of the work today and jenny and i are just sitting back and watching and enjoying ourselves at the entertainment so this recipe is my favorite holiday cookie molasses ginger spice cookies and i perfected this recipe they're crispy and chewy at the same time we've got three different types of ginger in there which spiced girl what's that definitely uh this is definitely is it angry spice it's uh ginger spice oh dude of course it's ginger angry sporty all right that shows you exactly how gay i am scary scary okay holidays let's get started all right so we begin this cookie process with a process called creaming have you ever creamed before [Music] um well okay let's just go right on into it this is basically the process i'm an adult this is just basically the process of combining sugar and butter and beating it until they become fully whipped and we've incorporated a lot of air so we're going to start with that's what you have to call that that's what we call creaminess this is harder than i thought it was going to be so we're going to start with two sticks of softened butter so if you want to add those you can just you need to take that out oh well why don't you what is this this is this magic this is a it's a creaming tool in fact it is a creaming tool this is an aftermarket attachment for the kitchenaid that scrapes the bowl as you whip and it works way better than the ones that have this i hate that so yeah yeah you never have to scrape the sides with a spatula this is the side swipe the beater blade is the lame one yeah i have a beer no beater blades side swipe attachment for the kitchenaid just make sure you get the one that's for the right size bowl that you have all right um next oh by the way quick tip on softened butter how many times have you tried to start baking cookies and forgotten that you needed to soften your butter um zero okay well for those of us that bake cookies it happens all the time it does then you try to use your microwave but half the butter gets melted and it's just a mess so this is your quick tip for softening butter when you need to soften it in a hurry okay get a bowl fill it with 80 degree water use your kitchen thermometer if you don't have a kitchen thermometer shame on you get one 80 degree water you can drop two cold sticks of butter from the fridge in there and they will be softened in five to eight minutes so it's very very very informative not as quick as the microwave but much more efficient you won't get any melting and they'll be perfectly soft less than 10 minutes all right um now we need brown sugar 5.7 ounces i use dark brown sugar because it's got more flavor but light brown sugar will also work 5.7 ounces if you're measuring this at home that's three-fourths of a cup of firmly packed brown sugar but using a scale is so much easier than trying to measure and press down especially when it comes to brown sugar so get yourself correct 5.7 [Music] that extra gong is important for the flavor development all right so now we're gonna put the bowl nest it onto the mixer no you see these little flanges they they hit over those and then push it back push it down and it will lock itself in place yeah he's not very good at this is he there he is your first clue all right all right now the side swipe goes in can you kind of see how that little nipple on the side there's a lot of nipples to work with excellent other ways no no that's you did it right you did it right now raise the bowl using the lever there yeah okay now let's turn it on about three quarters that's on this side sorry about three quarters of the way up after creaming for three or four minutes it's light and fluffy like this it's ready for the next addition now i typically mix my dry ingredients together while this is creaming but that was too loud for us to hear so we're going to mix the dry ingredients now all right dry ingredients 11.4 ounces of flour if you're measuring at home by volume that's two and a fourth cups of all-purpose flour so 12.2 is more than 11. 12.2 is more than 11.4 okay don't you have a degree in mathematics no east asian studies really yes sure that yes really emphasis on china you work for a global company so i guess there's half a teaspoon of kosher salt if you're measuring this at home using table salt you're gonna do a fourth of a teaspoon this is this is this is a teaspoon that's a teaspoon so half of that we don't want we don't want salty cookies okay and one and a half teaspoons of baking soda not baking powder they are not interchangeable they are not now it is time for our spices so these are predominantly ginger cookies so we're going to use a whole tablespoon of ground ginger good three ounces of crystallized or candied ginger you can just dump it right in now the whole thing is already weighed now the thing about crystallizer candy ginger is if you go to whole foods it will take one it will take one of your entire paychecks to get that much crystallized ginger if you go to winco or uh or even central market you can get crystallized ginger for way cheaper almost at the same price that regular fresh ginger is but brought to you by winco and two teaspoons of cinnamon all right or just a scant tablespoon one teaspoon of cardamom one of my very favorite flavors to use with warm spices and then half a teaspoon each of clove and nutmeg then and then we're getting a great fresh nutmeg is this the small is this the largest one you can find no i have larger nuts but um i specifically selected a small nut because i don't think you can handle the larger notes all of that was so wrong you walked right into that didn't you that that's that's sort of how i roll and again you can use pre-ground nutmeg but i just love the aroma of freshly grated nutmeg and i love to torture chips yeah so once once the entertainment's over let me know when i've scraped enough that's probably good and then these secret surprise ingredients black pepper freshly ground black pepper about a quarter of a teaspoon equivalent that's maybe six or eight turns black pepper actually has a surprisingly fruity aroma to it it really complements these cookies quite well all right so get that stirred around there with your fingers we can move it off of the scale all right we have a few more liquid ingredients to incorporate before we put our dry ingredients in the first ingredient will be a cracked egg okay excellent mixture and six ounces of molasses that's about half of a cup if you're volume measuring at home two teaspoons of freshly grated ginger and it'll grate better perpendicular which is across the grain like that like that yeah yeah yeah you know what perpendicular means i thought you're good at math all right and then about a teaspoon's worth of vanilla and uh well our measuring cups are dirty so just estimate oh god that seems like a bad idea there we go excellent all right so let's get that back onto the mixer and get that going very good we'll let that go for just a little bit now we're going to incorporate the dry ingredients on the lowest setting and we're going to mix just until it's all disappeared right yep you can kind of scrape it in there your hands if you don't have one of these self-scraping paddle attachments you'll just need to stop every now and then and scrape the sides of the bowl with your spatula very nice so dry ingredients got incorporated still a tiny little bit of flour here and there that's perfectly fine go ahead and wash your hands okay i'm going to demonstrate the formation of the cookies because it requires a little bit of skill but then i'm going to let you do it before i do it i want to talk about your baking sheet here i've lined it with a little piece of parchment if you don't know you can buy these pre-cut sheets of parchment that are already sized and it's way more convenient than having the big rolls that you have to tear because they never tear all the way so these are wonderful things here if you are going to be baking these cookies straight into the oven you're going to space them out you can do about 12 cookies on one baking sheet but what i like to do is form all the cookies for for the entire batch onto one baking sheet put it in the freezer and freeze it and then i have bags of cookies that way i can bake four or six or a dozen at a time without having to bake them all at the same time right because fresh cookies are much more delicious than cookies that have been sitting around for three or four days so i really like this method that way you've always got cookies on demand and in that case you can fill the entire sheet but because we're going to bake them we're going to do 12 cookies on this sheet so what you're going to do again if you have one of these smaller ice cream scoops this is the perfect thing for portioning out your cookies they'll all be the same size if not you can use two teaspoons but i'm going to get that full and kind of raked off like that scoop it right into a bowl of sugar you can use any type of sugar you can use the coarse raw sugar or the fine sugar like this you can use sanding sugar which they sell in the wedding section of the section of the arts and craft stores you just want to handle it gently so that the cookie batter doesn't get all over your hands right if you handle it too rough you'll start to get it on your hands so i'm gonna do three in a row and do four rows of that so go ahead and take it away you go chips you want to rake it off evenly out good excellent the coarser textured sugars will give you more of a crunch in your cookies the finer texture sugars will give a nice delicate crunch i didn't even need to demonstrate that you didn't she is a pro i don't know where he learned it he learned it from me he's just a quick learner give me the credit i deserve about his first ginger cookie one of the nice things that i do like about baking them from the frozen steak is that they don't tend to spread as far and they tend to be a little bit taller so i actually really do prefer freezing them and then baking them on demand very well done the oven is preheated to 350 degrees we're gonna put it on the center rack we're gonna make it five minutes and we're gonna rotate it for even baking and bake it five more minutes okay if you're baking the frozen version 350 degrees six minutes rotate six minutes okay gotcha there we go all right cookies are just out of the oven they'll look a little bit dry around the outside but still just a bit moist on the inside that's perfectly normal and and and good this one though that's a sad that was yours oh you're blaming that one on yes because i poured much heavier than that is yours now what is yours because it was you flipped it right i think you all don't really know what i'm talking about all right again with these you want to set them on a surface that's okay for your hot pan let them sit for about three minutes and then if you can use a spatula to pull them off onto a cookie sheet they can get a little bit dry if you leave them on here the full time to cool if you're going to use the same baking sheet to bake another round of cookies let it cool fully before you put the next batch of cookies in the oven so that they don't over bake we're going to need to give these a few minutes before we can taste them but i promise you they're going to be delicious and especially that one no one's going to be which i'm confident was yours that's the last one that you put on there it is time to taste yes i usually like to cool them a little bit more fully so they're not quite as soft but there's nothing wrong with a soft warm cookie i'm going to make you eat that really ugly one that you baked thank you i appreciate that i mean i should i should have to suffer through this this incredibly horrifically prepared i really baked it i just i'm not going to say that on camera so delicious you know what i thought you didn't eat sweets i eat these size and shape doesn't matter this is delicious they're not a good cooking i want to ask you an honest question yes sir why the heck would anybody eat a sugar cookie when you can eat this yes when you're looking for a holiday cookie this is the recipe to use", "tBny48RWHAM": "[Music]", "ws9acLv0oR4": "(calm music) - My earliest memories\nare tied to my mother making cookies in our old kitchen in a wood cook stove and a lot of the older\nwomen, Moravian women, they make cookies because\nthat was just a tradition. - Preserving history, to me,\nit says a lot about us today. I think anybody who can\nreach back into their past or even just try to reach\nback into their past by making cookies their grandmother made is really gonna feel\nthat connection strong and that is living history. That's living history\nthat lives through us. And so it's not only a\nreaching back to the past, but it's also a reaching\nout to everybody around us. (laughing) (bell dings) (uplifting music) The Moravian cookie today,\nat least as it's here in North Carolina, it is\nsomething that very much speaks for here. Probably more than a lot\nof things that people may not have heard of of Old Salem or even Winston-Salem, but\nthey probably have heard of those ginger cookies. (laughs) - Go ahead.\n- Go ahead. (laughs) - We got married Friday,\nJune the 13th, 1952. Something else. I knew when we met in\nhigh school, I knew she was looking for a\nhusband, I didn't know she was gonna looking for a future employee, but yeah, she got both. - I'm a seventh generation\nMoravian and nothing's changed. The recipe's not changed one\niota from the very beginning. - The connection between\nthe past and the present that kind of connection to\nsomething that I have found is universal and if you\ncan taste it that just makes it a little bit more immediate. So knowing that what\nyou're eating isn't a whole lot different from what they\nwere eating 200 years ago just makes that connection\na lot more substantial. - Moravian cookies are difficult to make because it has to be very\nthin and then you have to be very careful baking\nit that they don't burn because they are so thin. I was making the cookies by\nmyself, rolling the cookies, I could make a hundred pounds of sugar cookies a day in eight hours and then when I hired\nsomebody to take over my job I was happy if they\ndid half of what I did. Every lady that's baking\nand rolling cookies, rolling and cutting cookies down there is an artist in aprons because she knows just exactly how much, how to do this! - The people we've got\nthat's the only thing that's more payable than our cookies. (calm music) (phone rings) (phone rings) (chatting) - I'm so very proud, you\nknow, to carry on a tradition that I don't think anybody\nelse does, you know, in this day and time\nand it is my grandmother making them on a wood\nstove, my mom helping her, when I was growing up my\nbrother and I helped my mom. We used to mix up that\ncookie dough by hand which was terrible (laughs)\nand then, you know, just seeing the business grow. It's just been very gratifying. - What keeps people coming\nback to these cookies is the tradition and is\nthe fact that they're made by hand and is that flavor\nthat you can only get making them by hand. Change is, you know,\nis interesting and fun and fascinating to\npeople, but there's always for some people this interest in returning or in something that\ndoesn't change, something that stays consistent\nbecause it's the same way they remember it when they\nwere kids, and they can cast themselves back even, you\nknow, before they were born, you know, to times long past. - I think a lot of people like to know that they're eating\nsomething that, even though it was baked yesterday or this morning, that it is something that connects them to the past and that connection really is very important to them. - I love history. - [Interviewer] Do you think,\nlike, you're a part of it? Do you feel like you're a part of it? - Yes! I know I'm part of it.", "VWkrSX5Tuig": "hi everybody Lulu and I are starting a new series it's our favorite fall recipe and they're going to be our gluten-free dairy-free egg-free recipes now today we're going to start out with my molasses cookies of definit fall of favorite so let's get cooking so for these gluten-free dairy-free egg-free molasses cookies unique gluten-free flour brown sugar molasses you can use either shortening but I choose to use coconut oil salt applesauce if you're not going to use egg I use a half a quarter cup of applesauce we replace one egg cinnamon ginger cloves ground ginger and ground cloves xanthan gum and baking soda and of course you need your equipment the measuring spoons measuring cups and I like to use my KitchenAid if you don't have a KitchenAid it's okay you can mix them by hand and of course being the girly girl that I am I bought a pink KitchenAid so now let's get cooking so the first thing we're going to do is add our wet ingredients takes a quarter cup of applesauce for the one egg it also takes a quarter cup of molasses which looks to be about all I have in this jar now for the coconut oil I always like to use this new Teva brand and it's refined and does not have the scent or taste of coconut which is really nice for baking when you want to make something that you don't want to have it tastes coconutty so I'm going to I edit the molasses applesauce to replace the egg of course if you want to use egg you can I'm adding in my coconut oil okay now I have a brown sugar hat for you it's changed my life of brown sugar it always used to dry up on me and I'd end up having to throw the end away so I found this little piece of it's like the Terra Cotta clay pot flower pot and you soak it in water for like 20 minutes and then you just stick it down in your bag of brown sugar and it keeps it moist until you use it up I have not had any dry up on me ever since I've been using one of these I've seen him around at different kitchen stores I got this at Xander's and Frankenmuth they're under $5 they're really inexpensive in it it really works well so now we need a cup of packed brown sugar and now we're just going to mix the wet ingredients and the sugars together [Applause] I don't know if you have a KitchenAid if you have this problem but it doesn't the beater doesn't reach down to the bottom of the bowl so I always have to stir mid mixing and stir from the bottom up so that it gets everything up from the bottom of done mixing bowl and then whip some more so now I need to add the dry ingredients first I'll mix them in a bowl need to two-thirds cup flour - that's a 2 cup measure and 2/3 cup flour I use the King Arthur's glutton measure for measure flour you want to make sure with any gluten-free flour that you get measure for measure cup 4 cup next I need a teaspoon of cinnamon and I usually like to go a little bit heavy on cinnamon because it's my favorite ok yeah I need a teaspoon of soda now I need 1/2 a teaspoon of xanthan gum gluten-free baking have to have the xanthan gum kind of helps replace that gluten half a teaspoon of ginger 1/4 teaspoon of cloves and a quarter teaspoon of salt okay okay so now I'm going to mix the dry ingredients together really well so it's well incorporated and then add that to the wet I have this nice little shield to put on here so when you add the dry ingredients it doesn't go flying all over the place [Applause] it's kind of a thicker dough just supposed to be okay you just want to mix it enough to get it well incorporated you don't want to over mix it so it gets tough being that it's fall time I've got my fall hand towel out here if you want to know how to make these easy towels they take less than 15 minutes to make watch our DIY Intel video and then also I always keep one of these on the stove for hands but then I have a regular towel on here for dishes and I they always fall off on the floor so I just took one of those little rubber pad you used to unscrew a tight-fitting top on a can or on a jar and I just taped it on here and it just key it's just sticky enough that it keeps the towel on here from slipping off onto the floor okay now to scoop these out I'm going to use a medium sized scoop it's probably about an inch in diameter maybe an inch and a half and just scoop these out until I'm done this scoop not only makes them look uniform in appearance all the same round shape but it also helps you to get the exact amount each to each and every time okay after you've scoop them out on the tray I just pick each one up and roll it into a little ball and then I roll it in sugar just gives it that nice a little extra sweetness when you bite into it and a pretty look to them now you want to make sure that your oven is preheated at 350 degrees while you're rolling these you know I just put them in the oven for nine to twelve minutes they're all done and who they are they're our little ginger morsels of no meanness they're so delicious they're soft and chewy on the inside and a little bit crisp on the outside they are wonderful a wonderful fall cookie to make mmm delicious Lulu approved they're really good happy fall everyone", "dDCIeXElQQc": "today I'm going to show you how to make pumpkin molasses cookies you're going to start out by mixing your dry ingredients which is your flower your baking soda salt and pumpkin pie spice here's going to mix that together a little bit then you're going to work on your wet ingredients so I'm going to cream together my butter add in my molasses my pumpkin puree and some brown sugar I'm going to mix that together for about two minutes then I'm going to add in one egg and mix again and then you can gradually start adding in your dry ingredients when you're done your batter should look something like this now the recipe recommended that you chill it but I never chill my cookie dough so I just scooped it out with a little small scoop I dropped it directly into a bowl of sugar and just kind of rolled it around then I placed it on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat and i flattened it with a cup this is what they look like before they went in the oven I baked them for about 12 to 14 minutes and this is how they turned out so thanks so much for watching I hope you give this recipe a try and I will link all the information in the description box below bye guys", "Y1g3MlMYXwQ": "so first you're just going to want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and then taking a glass bowl or and kind of boil I guess but you're just going to take a banana and mash it up in that bowl and then go ahead and add one cup of wheat flour and then add one cup of oats and then mix that all around so the banana is like evenly distributed and all that and then you're gonna go ahead and add an egg and you can't just use an egg white if you want it to be a little lighter but I just said she's the whole egg this is easier and then you're going to take half a cup of molasses and add that to the mixture okay I admit it doesn't look like the most appetizing mixture right now but don't worry it tastes really good so then add a teaspoon of ginger a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of cinnamon and then mix it again to distribute all those little trying dance and all that and it should look kind of like this and then taking your baking sheet and we were okay we were out of parchment paper so I could only do three cookies at a time which is kind of sad but sorry about that but then you're just going to of course put it in your oven and bake it for about 25 minutes I checked at 20 minutes and they were like really close to being done so just you know whenever you think they're ready and then take them out and I actually added some white sugar on them just to make them a little sweeter but you don't have to do that I think I want to but I would recommend it so that is my cookie you do it yourself I hope you guys like this and be sure to tweet me a picture if you try this out thanks for watching bye guys", "UkB3z5Nf_Bk": "hey guys welcome to the kitchen today I'm so excited to share with you a new find at Trader Joe's cookies yay these are ginger molasses cookie dough we used to make ginger molasses cookies growing up for the holidays and I have made them for years does that uh still feet that kind of stuff in the house and who is so I'm so excited to see these Trader Joe's ready to go yep so we're gonna make them today and let you know how they are first I got stands ready I like to line my pans with baking parchment or foil I just don't like to clean up or that spray stuff because sometimes they always stay burn whatever something I'd like to do that and then we're gonna it started with the dough next all right so I've just open the package and you can see they're all in nice little size and they're gonna go right on my parchment baking sheet here but you know that's not a bad size piece of cookie dough put them in by twos until I get the whole thing filled up and then I'm gonna stick it in the oven all right I've got them on my baking pan now according to the directions that I just read it says to put them two inches apart on the baking pan and so I'm not really sure how much they're gonna spread so I'm kind of nervous so I'm only gonna do four and then we'll really know what they look like on this man all right all right as you can see there they are I just stopped it dude they wanted me to do a 12 to what was at 16 minutes but this I've been kind of runs hot so I've got it in for 10 minutes and then we'll see what's why right so the timer's going off and it's only been ten minutes but I'm touching the top so they really feel soft so I'm gonna put them back in for another minute but I must tell you kitchen the smells fantastic it's a fragrant I'm like I'm a child again it's awesome all right now I've got both pans out of the oven and you can kind of see the difference in the cookies this was our original pan and then this was my second pan now my second pan was on the bottom of the oven a little closer to the heat and quite honestly I just lost track of time while I was baking so you could see they're a little darker and I don't know if I think I like that better the other thing I did that was different let me see if I can get it over here the light according to the directions you could uh here we go mm-hmm so you can see the tops a little different they're a little sugar so according to the directions on the package you could roll in or dip the tops and sugar so I wanted to see what that looked like but these are okay they're really hot but kind of like all a little bit darker they are I wanted to show you the really cool thing about this parchment I guess these are pretty cool now but this is the best part about it look they just just come right up the cookies and then the parchment looks looks so good that you can use it again now just also wanted to follow up and be like hey these are in the fearless flyer that's out on page what did they say page 19 the gingerbread molasses cookie dough so check them out and you could leave a comment below and tell me what you think about the gingerbread cookies are they like your family recipe or would you buy them again I'm kind of cool about them because I've got half the package still in the freezer or refrigerator you know for another day so about warm cookies today finish my cards and then maybe maybe I'll make some more in January or something I mean I really like that convenience hey everyone I realized I didn't actually ate a cookie with you and I'm sure you're dying to know what they were like so my cookie jar I've got the cookies that we baked so I've got to hear that these were the ones that went stayed out a little came up quicker you know a little soft still and then these are the ones that I forgot about and they were in a little longer so you can see they're totally different this one's much darker this is also had the sugar on top but you can see the difference and these are definitely firmer so I'm gonna go with the software but they they just break nicely and there are delicious just delicious we've got that nice rich molasses tea flavor enough sweet the gingers there it's very good and you know couldn't be easier so if you haven't tried them I highly recommend it and let me know what you think in the comments below or on the blog thanks very much bye", "hRNBKe83kMg": "[Music] everyone its Blakely with everyday gourmet today I'm going to show you an awesome Christmas cookie recipe I'm going to do a crinkle cookie but not just a regular one I'm gonna do a gingerbread one because what says holiday more than gingerbread so here we go we should exactly how to do it so the first thing I'm going to do is come together my butter and sugar so I have one and a half sticks of butter and 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar right in here just kind of blend into that I have two tablespoons of butter I'm gonna do some vanilla extract right in here about a teaspoon and then I have three quarters of a cup of molasses we're gonna put all that molasses right in there I'm gonna mix it together perfect so now it's time to put in our dry ingredients I'm gonna do 3 cups of all-purpose flour right in here 3 cups of all-purpose flour decide and then in here I'm also going to grate some fresh ginger in here if you don't have a fresh ginger you can always use ground ginger that's fine but I like the spiciness of fresh ginger in there so I'm going to do about a teaspoon of fresh ginger or a tablespoon of ground perfect then I'm also gonna add one tablespoon ground cinnamon a half a teaspoon of ground clove we're gonna do 3/4 of a cup or a cup teaspoon 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking powder nope soda baking soda and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt so now that's all come together I'm going to chill it and you want to chill it for a few reasons one you want it to kind of set up because look it's a very kind of loose snow here so we want it to get that to keep the shape so am i keeping the shape and and freezin it it keeps it shaped much better so let's put half of it in here and we're gonna do half in another one also you can do this and and save it for later and then bake it off it'll save really nicely in the refrigerator or freezer put in there just gonna put this in here I'm gonna kind of flatten it out so I'm gonna put it in the freezer to kind of speed things along but if you have the time you can put it in refrigerator for two hours or in the freezer for about 20 minutes all right gonna put it in there and let it chill completely both of them okay so our dough has been in there chilling in their freezer for about 20 minutes or 30 minutes or up to a few hours in the refrigerator so now what I want to do it do like two inch balls here want to make sure you don't you don't play with them too much only because you don't want your hands the heat of your hands to kind of start melting them so once you do that we're gonna toast toss them completely in granulated sugar and then just like that look at that perfect gonna keep making our balls the last one but make sure you set them about an inch apart all right so I ever other than making right now at 350 I'm gonna put them in there for 12 minutes exactly and then take them out and let them cool I'm gonna work on the other pan here so my cookies are out there cool go cute they are 12 minutes in the oven such an easy recipe can't wait to try it

fully [Music] combined [Music] add in one cup of hot water give it another good mix get hypnotized in your frothy mix for a minute [Music] [Music] and then one cup of vegetable oil then you'll want to get your teaspoons out and add one teaspoon of baking soda to the mix one teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of nutmeg 1 teaspoon of ginger and 1 teaspoon of allspice and then give everything a good mix again now that you have all that together you can start adding some flour just white all-purpose works totally fine i like to start adding it in about one to two cups at a time and start mixing it in and slowly keep incorporating your flour in total you'll want about almost 10 cups altogether you're just gonna keep adding until it becomes a nice soft dough and eventually you'll have something that looks like this [Music] i like to put a little flour on my work surface slap that dough down and you're going to want to roll it out to about a half inch or so [Music] feel free to use any type of cookie cutter you have i just use a simple mason jar lid you'll just press it in and twist into the dough until it separates your cookie from the dough i repeat that a bunch of times and then peel away the excess dough and there you have your cookies you can always re-roll anything left flatten it out again and keep cutting cookies until you have nothing left then you'll want to put those in something nonstick and throw them in a preheated oven at 375 for about 12 to 15 minutes or so in the meantime you can finish cutting out the cookies with the rest of your dough and admiring the smell in your house once they're done you can set them on a wire rack to cool for a good 10 minutes or so until you're ready to frost now for a quick frosting you're going to take around a cup of lard or crisco throw it in a bowl with a good tablespoon of almond or french vanilla extract and at least four cups of powdered sugar [Music] i then like to smoosh those together until they form a crumbly mixture [Music] and then you can add in a half a cup of heavy cream or whole milk and just mix it until it all becomes smooth now that your mixture is nice and smooth you could try to butter knife it and just spread the mixture on the cookies but if they're nice and soft they can break so i like to use a piping bag just open it up take your spatula or spoon and shove it down in there as much as you can fill up the bag and twist the top and squeeze it out into any silly ugly or beautiful designs that you can come up with i definitely wouldn't call mine on the beautiful side but they were still definitely delicious shout out to my gram for giving me the recipe these are super nostalgic soft chewy cookie with nice sweet icing i don't know if there was ever a time as a kid going over there that these weren't readily available i hope you liked the video let me know in the comments what your favorite sweet from your grams was like if you like cookies and subscribe for more recipes", "2Yi4zCz1-Pg": "[Music] hi and welcome to another episode of cooking with for boss it's christmas edition wow this is exciting it is so what are we cooking today i don't know what should we cook today well i know i always wanted to make something with molasses well we might as well make the special for fosse special christmas cookie the ginger molasses cookie that sounds great i know you're probably dying to know what goes in this recipe so here it goes we have butter we're gonna do three fourths cup we have sugar one cup of sugar over here actually we have one egg we have a half a cup of molasses we use grandma's molasses so we will see how grandma's turns out and we have one a half a teaspoon of vanilla and two and a fourth cup of flour just regular flour two teaspoons of baking soda and one teaspoon baking powder half teaspoon of salt which we have right here and one teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon ground cloves which we're grinding up right here because we had whole cloves and then a half teaspoon ground ginger okay time to cream you're gonna cream some butter and we're putting the butter and you want your butter to be fairly soft too butter and some sugar in a bowl and you're gonna take a hand mixer and you're gonna cream it so three two one okay so that was a super fast hand mixer as you saw but you want your your creamed egg and sugar to be nice and fluffy and then now you're going to add the rest of your wet ingredients so here goes the molasses it's awfully slow now we're going to add some egg and now we are going to add our vanilla and now we're just going to give it a nice mix again this time by mr mix-a-lot yes to add your dry ingredients so the main thing about the dough not sticky and not dry if it's sticky add more flour so we're gonna add all of our dry ingredients into our molasses mixture add a little bit of our flour maybe mix it add a little bit more and see if we are doing on that next mix and starting to smell like molasses and ginger in here [Laughter] oh yep it's nice it looks like it's firming up a little bit and that's too sticky maybe a little bit more of our and when we're done with this we're going to roll it into one inch balls or really however a little smaller than a golf ball or like a gumball a big guy okay so we actually had to add some more flour because it was sticky but now if you see you want to be able to easily roll it without it sticking to your hands so kind of a consistency where it's almost like peanut butter but not sticky so you can roll it easily into your balls we're gonna roll out a few balls all right so now that we've rolled out our balls we're gonna dip them roll them around and coat them in sugar before we pop them into the oven all right so now we're going to throw these bad boys into a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes here we go they're done all right so our cookies are made and jonah's going to sample them we usually try to do a taste test between two different cookies but tim hortons doesn't make ginger molasses cookies anymore so jeremy will just taste stars that's good because it's soft on the inside and then the outside is like crunchy so it gives you a bit of crunch these are good passive taste tests 100 please make sure to like and subscribe so you never miss a video here are our bloopers hi and welcome to another edition of cooking with the hello today we're going to be making chewy gingerbread molasses cookies", "Z9gdQ9Bs3AU": "so we have our two cups of flour there to be sifted and we're going to add all of our spices which you've been measured we'll sit that and now we have our dry ingredients ready to go now need about three eighths of a cup of molasses so it's time to get started with a cup of Crisco Oh as white sugar brown sugar I'm data ok we'll add had the flower and now it's time to mix by hand as you can see the dough is not too wet but add a little more flour and stir that in when you're done and oh can be worked by hand and hold together like that should not be sticky the dough's been worked into a ball and we're going to just put it in here and refrigerate it for 20 minutes to a half hour well I would be remiss if I didn't admit that I forgot to put the molasses in before so I had to add it after the fact and you can see it's probably a little bit different color there but we're now going to make some cookies so this is still pretty soft you can see nice and soft scrape that on the bottom so you get a ball and roll it between your fingers get a nice it's called a walnut sized ball and then roll it in the sugar take that nice and move that out of the way okay and put that on there and I'm going to do all all the rest of them at once but the meantime I'm going to get a little sugar try and get a little sugar on the bottom of that and just flatten them a little bit so I'll be right back so there's nine of them and i'm just going to flatten out a little bit just a little some people say criss cross with a fork I don't see any need for that and whose are ready for the oven see I put those on the bottom rack 358 2 10 minutes so about half way through I like that turn them check them and put front to the back in the back in the front having these on the very bottom rack I left them in about 12 minutes and starting to look good so take them out see how we did and while they're still warm out sprinkle a little more sugar for decoration on the tops just a little bit there we go you know I let those sit there a good couple minutes on the cookie sheet to set up and you can see they've lost their dome shape a little bit they're flattened out and I'll take them and move them and put them on a rack to cool and there you are still quite warm they'll crisp up on the outside and stay soft on the inside here I put 16 on the sheet made the much smaller thinner and they're going to be more like Ginger Snaps than molasses cookies", "lEyu9RL4-nc": "[Music] hi foodie friends and welcome back to another video in today's video i'm going to be showing you how i make these delicious and chewy soft baked gingerbread cookies if you're not into the classic gingerbread or ginger snap cookies but love that gingerbread flavor then this recipe is for you not a baker no worries i will be sharing my tips and tricks with you throughout this video so make sure to watch till the end [Music] let's get started so step number one in this recipe will be to cream your butter and your sugar [Music] for this step it's best to use a hand mixer or a stand mixer i have my hand mixer set to medium speed and we're going to continue mixing until we achieve a paste like consistency so this process took me about three to five minutes and my general rule of thumb is if you think your butter and sugar are creamed you need to continue for at least a couple more minutes next we're going to add in one egg into our mixture then add in your vanilla extract and this can be pure or artificial now for the most important ingredient in our cookies molasses important because it makes your cookies really soft and chewy but it also gives gingerbread cookies that brown color that we're looking for if you don't have molasses don't you worry you can substitute the quarter cup in this recipe with two tablespoons of honey mixed with two tablespoons of brown sugar now it's time to mix all of our wet ingredients as you can see i got really tired mixing it by hand so i switched back over to my hand mixer continue mixing on medium speed until you can no longer see any lumps in your batter [Music] we are done with our wet mixture so we can set this to the side and work on our dry ingredients to our flour we're going to add in the salt and baking soda then we're going to add in the spices that make up that gingerbread flavor 2 teaspoons of ground ginger 1 8 of a teaspoon ground cloves 1 8 of a teaspoon ground nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon feel free to adjust the measurements of these spices if you like a cookie with a kick don't be afraid to add in more cinnamon and ginger mix your dry ingredients thoroughly [Music] once done it's time to combine our dry ingredients with our wet ingredients [Music] for this step i like to use more of a folding motion instead of mixing in the video you can see that i'm taking the flour from the sides and bottom of the bowl and bringing them upwards we're going to continue this process until we no longer see any of the dry ingredients in the bowl and now that our cookie dough is done it's time to add in our mix-ins in this video we're using white chocolate chips feel free to use any type of mixing you like or leave them out totally up to you to scoop out my cookie dough and make sure they're even i'm using my medium ice cream scooper and this recipe will yield 12 medium cookies if you don't have an ice cream scooper you can also just use your hands your cookies may not end up uniform in size but that's okay too this next step is not necessary and honestly i only do it for aesthetic purposes i'm just going to take a quarter cup of the white chocolate chips and add them to the top of my cookie so that when they come out of the oven you can really see the chocolate chips on top of the cookie our next step is to chill these cookie dough balls for at least 30 minutes in the fridge the reason why we do this is that chilling the cookie dough actually solidifies the fat in the cookies so when you bake them they don't spread out as much so we're left with really chewy and thick cookies once your cookie dough balls have chilled it's time to bake them i'm going to set them on a baking tray at least two inches away from each other and on a standard tray i can bake six cookies out of the oven let your cookies cool for about 10 minutes and tada we are done we have just made the most delicious soft baked gingerbread cookies and i hope you enjoy them if you guys like this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already to see some more yummy recipes from me thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you next time", "FEyIymMIabo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "hrR0S1U8pPw": "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel, this is Shirani Today I'll be showing you how I make these soft ginger cookies If you're new to my channel welcome And if you have not yet subscribed, I'll be glad to have you I'm gonna start off by peeling my ginger and I like using a spoon to do that because its just so much easier to use than a knife plus it's less wasteful Now I'm going to show you this trick that I learned recently I saw this on Instagram and I wasn't so sure about it at first but oh my gosh, this just changed the way I grate ginger I'll never do it any other way but this way all you have to do is put a piece of plastic wrap over your grater and You don't even have to cover the whole thing, just a piece that you're using just make sure you secure it on there and I have it set on a damp paper towel Just so it doesn't slide around too much Then just grate away like it's nobody's business I'm telling you. This makes it so much easier to clean up and you'll see what I'm talking about when I'm finished Will you just take a moment and look at the grater There is nothing left to clean oh my gosh, you don't understand, this is life-changing Like for real this is life-changing Thank you to that person on Instagram that made my life so much easier Okay, now it's time to get started on the cookies to my bowl, I'm adding some shortening White sugar Molasses An egg And some water I'm just giving everything a mix for about a minute or so with my electric mixer Now I'm adding all the dry ingredients and I'm starting with some all-purpose flour Salt Baking soda Nutmeg Cloves Cinnamon and of course the fresh ginger Give everything a good mix until thoroughly combined You can use ground ginger if you want But I'm telling you if you ever make it with fresh ginger, you'll never go back and use ground ginger. It makes such a difference To me this just reminds me so much of Belizean bulla I know I know this look nothing like bulla you might think girl you crazy that no so you make bulla but I'm telling you it might not look like bulla or the texture's not like bulla but the taste is there. I might even go out on a limb and say this better than bulla I mean This like bulla on another level For the Belizean people that are watching can you please help me out and leave a comment below and tell me if someone asks you. What da bulla How would you describe it? I was trying to think of ways that I could tell people what it is but it's hard to explain what it is cause There is nothing like it. I was trying to find a picture or anything online and I couldn't even find anything Anyways after I got everything all mixed together, I'm Covering it with plastic wrap and I'm putting it in a refrigerator for one hour to chill I have my baking sheet lined with parchment paper I'm using a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop here to put them on the pan If you don't have one you can just use 2 spoons to do that. And I'm just putting them couple inches apart on the pan I'm baking these at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for nine minutes This recipe makes a lot of cookies and makes three dozen But what I like to do is I put it in a ziploc bag and I freeze it So whenever we want some cookies, we'll just take some out ahead of time And then before I eat it I just pop it in a microwave for like 10 seconds and it tastes nice and fresh like it's just out of the oven This is what it looks like on the inside It's like a cross between a cake and a cookie. I don't know maybe a cake like cookie something like that Well, I hope you give this recipe a try and as always thank you for watching thank you for spending time with me and I'll talk to you in my next one. Bye", "n4NnJPajLyI": "hi I'm Suzy and I design impressed cookie press disks we have more than 250 shapes in over 30 things designed to manufacture right here in the United States by our small family-owned company now you might be thinking that a cookie press is just for Christmas and Christmas trees but I want you to think again because I'm going to show you how to get creative with your cookie press all year long hi from sunny Colorado today I'm showing you how to make gingerbread spritz cookies I'm gonna be using the gingerbread boy and the gingerbread girl from you guessed it our gingerbread set this is a very tasty recipe that's also really easy to press once we've gotten our dough made and our cookies pressed out and baked up we're just going to be using some red white and green icing to decorate them I'm hoping that I get through this blog in one piece today because I'm just getting over a pretty bad case of laryngitis so bear with me if my voice kind of breaks in and out but for now let's go ahead and get started I'm a bit of a broken record about this but I say every time that the foundation to a good spritz cookie is to go ahead and cream your butter really really thoroughly and when I say cream it I mean use an electric mixer and set it on your highest setting for me that's whip and I'm going to pretend that I'm making frosting and I'm gonna get it really fluffed up and a lot of air incorporated the butter will turn from the regular yellow it comes out of the fridge with into something a little bit lighter so make sure that you cream your butter extremely well because then you're gonna have a recipe that's light and airy when you eat it and it's going to be very easy to press so I'm going to go ahead and cream my butter and then we'll start adding the other ingredients all right with my butter creamed we have something that looks really terrific here there's lots of air incorporated and the color has changed it's nice and fluffy the next step in this kinda spritz cookie is to go ahead and add our granulated sugar you just add it all at once and then cream it again because that's how creamed cookies begin is by creaming the butter and the sugar together and with the sugar incorporated it's even fluffier than it was before so there's a good foundation the wonderful flavors in this recipe are going to come from molasses honey vanilla and the spices I've got cinnamon and ginger and cloves in here the next thing we want to do after adding our sugar is to add our wet ingredients so I'm going to go ahead and begin with the honey and the molasses and incorporate those two at once you don't really taste the honey in this recipe it just gives a little bit richer flavor to the sweetness but the molasses and honey incorporated in the next wet ingredient is just one egg [Music] gonna stop for a second and say I meant to add the vanilla at the same time as the egg because why waste an extra step I took a moment to add the spices to our flour mixture and I do that just because it helps the spices come out nice and evenly throughout the dough so go ahead and add the flour and then we'll get to pressing them now that my ingredients are all incorporated I've got a nice looking spritz dough here it's not that kind of chunky spritz appearance that's gonna make for a dough that's soft and easy to handle and easy to go through the press but also stiff enough to hold those wonderful shapes that we're gonna be making so I'm gonna go ahead and get cleaned up here and then I'll get out the baking pans and the cookie press and we'll get some pressing our next step is to load the cookie press my favorite way of doing that is just to use a spoon and just pack it into your barrel and press it down with the back of the spoon so once you get it inside here you just want to use the back of your spoon to just push out any air bubbles that you might find in the barrel because those air bubbles are gonna make your cookies come out kind of goofy shaped and that's not what we want because the whole point of spritz cookies is for them to have an awesome shape and I'll warn you the gingerbread dough is a bit stickier than most it's got all that molasses and honey in it so yeah it's sticky as far as spritz tones go it's a little harder to pack in but boy the flavor is absolutely worth it so I'm going to pack this up and then we'll get the disks ready I'm gonna start with the gingerbread boy and all you want to do is just plop the disk in the bottom ring of your press and go ahead and screw it on I always say that the best technique is to press a click or two into the air to get your pressure set in the barrel and to get the dough to begin extruding so that your first cookie has at least a chance of coming out well very often the first few cookies when you're pressing are gonna come out a little bit goofy because you're getting that pressure set so let's see if they come out goofy and we have to throw a few back in the bowl or if they're coming just right from the gate hey there we go that's a nice-looking gingerbread boy all right so I didn't have to warn you about the first few cookies ending up back in the bowl because these are coming out just fine with one click and they have a nice shape they're not too big he's just about he lost his foot so he is going back in the bowl along with his missing foot and then I'm going to wipe it clean to make sure that everything is nice and even so that was the next one could commit a little bit goofy he looks fine so you don't want to let your cookies get too big because the whole point is to have a nice crisp shape with a spritz cookie so don't if you're finding that they're coming out kind of big hold back on your clicks if you have a 1 click per cookie type press and just maybe give a half a click or 3/4 of a click and you'll get into a rhythm where you think of this as a dough pump whether it takes a half a click a full click or really slow click and click and a half it's all ok this is just a way to get the dough to extrude out onto the pan that's all so my guys actually look pretty good here none of them were too fat or too thin so that's pretty good I got the pan half full of gingerbread boys and then I'm going to switch discs and press out the gingerbread girls but I want to stop right here and show you an important technique when it comes to pressing both of these gingerbread shapes I've went ahead and got a little bowl full of water here and what I'm going to do is just dip my finger in it and not again let it get too wet but just kind of damp and then I'm going to go through and I'm going to kind of push in on the faces and then go tap tap tap tap on their bodies because gingerbread cookies are usually pretty flat but sprites cookies come out with nice high ridges which are wonderful on things like snowflakes and other things like that but on a gingerbread person you want them to be kind of flat so just go ahead and then take that slightly damp finger and push side-to-side and then straight down on their faces and then just tap tap-tap across their bodies just to kind of flatten them out a little bit so hopefully you can see what I'm doing I'll come in a little closer tap side to side and then straight down on their faces and then tap tap tap across their bodies and then they'll come out nice and smooth and flat and they'll look a little bit cuter and be a little easier to decorate one other thing notice is that if when you're tapping them down or even if when you press them they came out a little bit a little bit losing their definition a little chunky around the middle go ahead and just give them a squeeze so that they come out with it with that nice kind of curvy ginger boy gingerbread man gingerbread boy or girl shape so just give him a little pinch if you want to mine didn't really need it but just in case yours do feel free to give them a little pinch around the waistline I'm gonna go ahead and change out my disks now and just take the gingerbread boy and let mr. bear here hang on to him and grab the girl toss her into the bottom ring and go ahead and screw it up I'm gonna finish pressing out this pan with the girls so I'm gonna reset the pressure again we've got a little dough extruding and let's see if it's yours if you end up back in the bowl with these gals or if they're gonna press out just right can't believe I just hit gals how old-fashioned is that there we go they look just fine again I'm trying not to do too long and hard of a clip because I want them to come out nice and skinny just so that they maintain their definition whoops it didn't quite stick let's see if we can get her to stick look took that back in the bowl my pressure is off now if that ever happens to you where you get kind of caught between a between clicks press one cookie into the air and just wipe it away and now you should be back on more of that one-click rhythm let's see one click alright there we go alright the girls are all pressed out I'm gonna use my water to flatten them out the same way that I did the boys give a little tap push side-to-side on their faces and then straight down and then tap their bodies out so that you have a nice flat pretty surface to decorate and then I'll get these into the oven the girls are all pressed out and smoothed out so now I'm going to give you guys a little close-up I'll show you how they turned out the girls they're on the bottom and the little boys are men up on the top here so they're gonna go into my 400 degree oven and bake for about six to ten minutes check spritz cookies early and often because I just tend to brown quickly and once they start to brown they really go so check them off so I'm going to start with one of the girls and I'm gonna pick her up and come on into the close-up camera here and what I'm gonna do let's see if I have the right tip yeah I've got the number two tip and what I want to do is just add the buttons on her body here she is and I'll show you me to set her down give myself a little more stability here I'm gonna start my icing out make sure it's coming out nice and smooth there we go mr. bear very there can hold that so I'm just gonna add three dots very traditional decoration on a gingerbread person one actually I'm going to give her two and then the other thing I want to do is just give a little ruffle on the hem of her skirt so actually I find this easier to do what I'm holding it up so I'm just gonna pick it up and I'm gonna create little squiggles on the bottom I'm just gonna start here and just go squiggle squiggle squiggle squiggle and just create a little ruffled edge on the bottom of her skirt see just like that so she's got a little ruffle going on there and now I could go ahead and add her eyes and they'll be a little bit smaller than the buttons I don't want them to be too big but you want them to be nice and expressive and then if you just had one tube you could easily just switch out your tips for the the one for the two and now I'm gonna use this this thinner one oops gotta get it started to always have a clean tip when you begin and I'm just gonna add a little smiley mouth there now I have a happy gingerbread girl with just a little bit of ruffle on her skirt you want to make sure that just like you did with flattening out the dough that you've got a little dish of water to just tap your finger in don't let it get too wet cuz you don't want water dripping all over them and just tap down a little bit on the eyes and the buttons and any other parts that might be poking up a little bit where you pulled up on the icing that'll give it a nice neat finished look I picked up another gingerbread girl and this time I'm going to give her a little bow and hair and all you're gonna want to do is draw a little kind of an X with wings so here we go just gonna set her down and I'm gonna start in the middle of where I want it to be and just create kind of a triangle on one end and cross over to the other side down and finish it up and you can either leave it open like that or you could go ahead and fill it in and if you fill it in and I use the number one tip because it's a little bit more precise if you fill it in just tap it down a little bit so it has a nice even finish now she's got a little white bow in her hair mmm how cute is that so while I'm here with the number one tip I'm gonna give her her smile through the happy gingerbread girl I'll tap down the little edge it doesn't get too pointy and then I will add her eyes which I could even show you you could even do with the number one tip you just have to make them a little bit bigger her eyes will be a little close together cuz she's got that though there oh she has the cutest expression wait so you see her usually her eyes look pretty good I don't even need to tap them down so let's let's give her the traditional buttons down her belly here she'll just have three buttons she doesn't need a skirt one two three tap down the little little ridges that are left there if there are any and there we go a happy little gingerbread girl hmm I tighten the close-up camera in a little bit so you can see these details more I went ahead and started on a gingerbread boy and I gave him his eyes and his smile and now I'm gonna use the red icing to give him a cute little bow tie so we're gonna do it the exact same way that we did the bow on the girl we're just gonna start in the middle of where it should be let me get this icing started make sure it's ready to go make sure my tip is clean I'm just gonna start in the middle and I'm gonna go out and create a little triangle up down back to the center and then cross over and do the same thing and again you could leave it open or you could fill it in and then just tap it down I wanted to have a nice smooth finish there I just tapped it out a little bit and if anything doesn't look quite right you can always kind of smoosh everything around with your handy dandy toothpicks but that one looks pretty okay and then give him some buttons and I think maybe it will make him a very festive guy and we'll give him green buttons that's cute and the lowly number one for two because his bowtie is taking up some space there make sure I tap those down and here is our gingerbread guy he's a cute little boy and they've set him over here with the girl that's the basic technique for how all of these are done is I just went ahead and gave them some bow ties and some bows and some ruffled skirts and some buttons on their bellies other than doing their faces that's really all there is to this I've added a face to another gingerbread boy and I'm gonna add a scarf to him let me show you the technique that I thought was the cutest I experimented with this quite a bit and I wanted it to be something simple that you know wasn't too terribly difficult but something that still looked really cute so what I'm gonna do is just kind of squiggle I'm gonna look for an area about you know scarf sized and I'm just actually it's easier if you set it down I'm gonna begin to draw on him with the icing and just start squiggling up and down so that it has kind of like her skirt a ruffled effect but it's just a little bit tighter and now when I get to the other end of his neck I'm just going to come down and that gives it a little texture little definition so now he's got a red scarf and I think I'll keep him in that festive trend of having red and green and give him a couple of green buttons one two looks about right the scarf you don't really need to tap down at all because you want it to maintain that nice ruffled look so that it looks all furry like a scarf there you have it now that I've given you a basic look at how to use icing to decorate your gingerbread boys and girls I'm gonna go ahead and just finish mine out and decorate them in a whole bunch of different combinations and I hope that you'll take the time to just get creative and come up with ever whatever is gonna look really cool to you make these little boys and girls look like you just don't even want to eat them because they're just too cute maybe share in the comments what you came up with because I have a feeling that some of you are a lot more creative than I am thanks for watching I hope you've enjoyed this as much as I have hope you're having a very Merry Christmas season and as always happy baking from impress bakeware you", "9ysKVJjgc6w": "[Music]

going to be using half a tablespoon of ground ginger 1/2 a tablespoon of ground cinnamon 3/4 of a teaspoon of cloves and half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and we're going to be using three quarters of a cup of molasses what we're going to do first is combine our flour with our baking soda salt and our spices so I'm just putting my flour into a larger bowl just like that and then I'm going to put in my sugar or serve my salt in my baking soda and all of my spices and then using a whisk I'm just going to whisk them together so you're going to set this aside when it's all incorporated together and we'll be using it to finish off the dough and we're going to switch to our stand mixer now so with our stand mixer I have my butter in there already and I'm going to put in the brown sugar and now I'm going to just mix it until it's nice and fluffy looking much nicer now so I'm going to add in now is my egg and give that another mix I'm just gonna give my bowl and paddle another scrape and I'll be ready now to add in my molasses now the molasses are the apart along with the spices that give the Gingerbread the real rich flavor and I just have this really cool little tool here and you just press it up and it all comes out I've talked about it before in a couple videos and it's a pampered chef one if you can find one I highly recommend it for things like the molasses and peanut butter it really makes getting that sticky stuff out easily so I'm going to mix this up let it incorporate and then I'll be back to add in my flour so our wet ingredients are all combined and looking nice and creamy so I'm going to take all my flour mixture and I'm just going to put it into the bowl and I'm going to put my mixer on to low and I'm just going to let it mix until it's all incorporated so once it's at this stage it's all mixed together you want to get some plastic wrap and I'll show you how to wrap it up for the fridge so I have two sheets of plastic wrap here and I'm going to divide my dough roughly in half you probably want to get your hands dirty at this point and I'm just going to put it into the middle of one of the sheets and just make a little disk like shape and then you're going to put once you've wrapped it up you're going to put the dough into the fridge wrapped up in this plastic wrap for about an hour you can go longer like you can even leave it overnight totally you can even freeze the snow it's awesome for that sort of thing and then you're gonna what you why you want to put it into the fridge is because it's going to roll out nicer than it would right now because it if you kind of sticky right now and so once it's into the fridge it will cool down a little bit and then will make really nice dough for making gingerbread men and gingerbread houses so let's go fold this up like this making sure getting it all wrapped up just like that and it's ready for the fridge so this is how you make gingerbread dough now make sure you stay tuned for our upcoming videos on how to make gingerbread men and gingerbread house we're going to be using this dough so I'll see you soon you", "KRzFJW5Lt_Y": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to make do mama today we are baking without butter again and this time we're making gingerbread cookies and yes I know it's not Christmas I realized this is March and we are making gingerbread cookies but they're delicious and they don't deserve to be trapped believe December I came up with this adjustment to gingerbread cookie recipe because I was having some friends over for a cookie making party I wanted to make something classic and we made gingerbread cookies and we're not gonna use any butter or molasses now this recipe is based off of a recipe on give me some lovin her gingerbread cookie recipe it's a good one but I don't have all the things that she has and I'm gonna be making some changes plus that recipe makes a ton of cookies so I'm cutting this recipe in half so some of the measurements will be a little weird I'll put the link to her original recipe and my adapted recipe in the description box below so let's get started we're going to start by mixing our dry ingredients first we have a cup and a half of flour into that we're going to add a half a teaspoon of salt and some baking soda now this is our the weirdness comes in you're going to want a quarter teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda now for our spices now we can get whole cloves here so I had to grind these earlier to make some ground cloves so we're going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our ground cloves which smell amazing and then nothing we can also get here but we got this one at an imported food store I'm so we're going to use a quarter teaspoon of our nutmeg get in there and then cinnamon we're going to use a lot of cinnamon you use a half tablespoon of cinnamon which we can also get here in China okay so that's all of our dry spices now let's stir those together now for our wet ingredients now this would normally be butter but it's oil just regular vegetable oil and this here would be brown sugar and molasses now I can get molasses here but I have to go to an imported food store and it's really really expensive so we're going to use brown sugar you can usually substitute one cup for one cup of molasses or 3/4 cup of brown sugar in your bakers make sure there's no lumps now I'm going to crack in my egg and grate in some ginger got one whole egg egg stir that together now usually in gingerbread cookies you use powdered ginger but I'm gonna use fresh ginger because we can get fresh ginger really really easily here and very cheaply now you don't actually have to peel ginger as long as it's clean and since we're gonna be grading it you're not going to notice any of the peels in there just adds more ginger flavor so we're gonna grate into another bowl we want about a half a tablespoon of fresh grated ginger and here we have our grated ginger which is going to go into our wet mixture it also smells amazing now it's time to add our dry ingredients so here goes our flour and our spices now that our dough is mixed up we're gonna let it chill for a few minutes while we preheat our oven to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit but for me I'm gonna do about 200 degrees Celsius because my oven doesn't like me and the door opens all the time let's heat out so I'm doing 200 you can do 350 our dough is chilled our oven is preheated and our table is well floured so let's roll out some cookies and it's our dough and make it kind of into a round turn it over a couple of times to make sure it's not sticking and that's roll we want to be 1/8 of an inch thick you now I do have cookie cutters but they're Christmas cookie cutters Christmas trees and stars and things like that and I wanted to make some round cookies and I wanted them about this size so this is the cap to a baby bottle and that's what we're going to use to cut out our circles now to get our cookies onto our parchment lined baking sheet now I'm going to save the scraps to do with my toddler tomorrow because he loves to cook so we're gonna remove the scraps from around our cookies and put those in a bowl and cover them for tomorrow now that our cookies are on the tray we're going to put them in the oven to bake for about 10 minutes our cookies are finished baking and it smells really good in here these need to sit on the tray for about 5 minutes to finish setting up and then we'll put them on the cooling rack and eat them now I'm going to eat the ugly one this one had a little lump of brown sugar in it still and it melted in the oven so let's see if it tastes like gingerbread it's similar it's really good it's a really good spice cookie and there's a lot of ginger in there it is missing some of that deepness from the molasses that it would have given it but this is still a really great cookie crunchy delicious spice cookie I hope this encourages you to make Christmas cookies when it's not Christmas because delicious food should not be limited to one month thanks for watching bye bye", "nh68Rszok8I": "[Music] [Music]", "TQlFnV95p88": "I think you really enjoy our ginger molasses cookie for the holidays it's a really pungent ginger flavor the ginger has a real bite to it and it lingers on the back of your throat as well as the richness of the molasses we use blackstrap molasses and its really dark you can see it just by looking at the cookie and then just like a traditional ginger molasses cookie we roll it in sugar so when it bakes and spreads it gets all crackly and the sugar on top kind of sparkles it looks reminiscent of you know Frost so it has its kind of a wintry look to it you", "0iM5HCo-yCY": "hi I'm Shelly young owner the chopping block and today I'm going to teach you how to make a thick and chewy gingerbread cookie these cookies are really one of my favorites they have a just a little bit of crisp on the outside and a nice chew on the inside really flavorful really spicy and burner for the holidays so in my food processor I've started with 3 cups of all-purpose white flour there's 1 tablespoon of dry ginger 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon a 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of ground clove and a little bit of salt unsalted butter is our next ingredient we like to use unsalted butter and we can control the salt we put in here this is 12 tablespoons and 3/4 of a cup of dark brown sugar dark brown sugar it's just got a little more molasses in it than the light brown sugar all you have is light brown sugar that's fine too so I'm gonna start by pulsing this until it turns into a fine meal you can see it's kind of a mealy texture of the butters and fine pieces in there smells I can smell the cinnamon and spices smells delicious two tablespoons of milk I just drizzle that around this way and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to close the lid of the food processor and drizzle in 3/4 of a cup of molasses I've the container that the molasses was in Trice it helps a little bit and getting them alas this out here's our cookie dough what I'm going to do with this is I'm going to put this out onto a piece of parchment paper I'm going to chill it for you can chill it for 24 hours might be a little easier to roll if you do that but you can also just put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and try to get a chill on it so it's easier to roll and the thing about gingerbread is it is a dark cookie so you need a little bit of flour to roll it out but we want to minimize the amount of flour that we use so that your cookie doesn't look white so I'm a little cautious with that but I'll flip this down some people use cocoa since there's no cocoa in here it to me it doesn't necessarily make sense but what you can do just put your dough down and you can roll it with a parchment on top that helps a little bit I'm also going to do a technique because this this dough is pretty chilled I'm gonna beat it with the rolling pin and that helps to spread the dough out and kind of hat without warming the dough and this doesn't check and make sure that it snaps sticking to the bottom you don't want to roll all the dough out and then find out it's stuck this is a thick and chewy gingerbread cookie so I like to leave these relatively thick you can certainly roll this a little thinner if you like but before you start cutting your shapes again make sure that the dough is not stuck to the bottom of the board you're not going to get those cookies up if I wanted to do different sizes I could do that but just have one size and one cookie sheet one on the other this is a parchment-lined sheet pan I'm gonna do a little larger cookies so I've got all the cookies I can get out of the dough on its first roll I'm going to try to reroll this again so I can get some more cookies this is obviously dough that is still quite good I'm going to try to manipulate it as little as possible so that it doesn't in the dough doesn't get tough so see how I'm just going to push the dough together like so instead of putting it all into a ball and then re-rolling it so our gingerbread cookies have been baking at 350 these cookies take about 8 to 12 minutes and they're really a cookie you don't want to over bake so when you're pulling them out what you want to look for is that they get a little bit Brown around the edges and that's it what hasn't be thick and chewy is that they're just slightly under baked so really depending on how thick you cut them and the size of cutter that you use that'll vary the time but that is how you make a chewy gingerbread cookie you", "DbpInufvR3k": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]", "uAyxENHOvvY": "today we're gonna make molasses cookies and then [Music] [Music] sugar [Music]

blend of spices in them as well as a delicious molasses flavor and they have a really nice soft texture to them so let's get started we are going to begin with two cups of flour two teaspoons of baking powder one teaspoon of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice a teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger a quarter teaspoon of ground cloves and you're just going to sift that all together next we need 1/2 a cup of some sourdough starter one egg 1 cup of packed brown sugar 1/4 cup of molasses and a quarter cup of softened butter we're just going to go ahead and blend those ingredients together once they are thoroughly mixed you can start adding in the dry ingredients I like to just add them in kind of in additions and then at the end I will add the rest of the flour and just use a wooden spoon to mix until it gets to that really nice dough texture I like to use a cookie dough scoop to scoop out the cookie dough and you're just going to want about a one-inch ball and just go ahead and roll it around in your hands until it's smooth and then you're just going to place it in some loose granulated sugar and roll it around until it's completely covered we are going to bake these at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for around 13 to 16 minutes or until your cookies appear set once they are all done baking go ahead and place them on a cooling rack and that's it that is the soft sourdough molasses cookies if you guys make these cookies we would love to see how they turned out for you go ahead and tag us on instagram at homemade food junkie

putting my cookies roll them out and dipping them in the sugar so I can get them in of it alright it's the first hood and I use this little scoop not even ice cream scoop like a melon school roll this around roll it around in the sugar all right put that there and get the rest of these road that you want to even and I gotta be sure it's getting stuck I just put a lack see you [Music] [Music] my hands feel funny with this sugar so I just drop them straight from them yeah cuz I notice that when I do it this was a little smaller than the rest of them so they don't matter and y'all go me serve the same purpose they're gonna get eaten [Music] [Music] yeah you got to get dirty honey if you want these things to come out right this one how many batches this makes I really didn't pay attention to the recipe like that when I was I'm just making them you know you get what you get sick right Oh welcome to Rose work didn't we say look guess what is dope well loses face you know you learn something every day so it's gonna make it easier for myself it's just I know y'all saying why did she do that the first time I don't know my hands when I get doing doing this back I know I got to do it again but I'm going to wash my hands no brainer on that sticky situation sticky situation that's exactly what these cookies are a sticky situation but they're gonna be a good sensational sticky situation so if you like man who's lactose intolerant I'll drink at this point in my life long as I'm right no no yes you with it I got a suit just kitchen bye two more yeah it's just a movie and I'm gonna drop these in the oven and I'll be right back with you let me get my hands cleaned up well I just might have to do that first alright guys I'll be right back", "eDinVx_Okgw": "with the holiday season in being here if you guys remember one of my larger videos back in the day was my keno gingerbread house that day with Kayla kita after some experience today I'm gonna bring you some crunchy gingerbread cookies now you'll see mines in the shape of tree houses and gingerbread men but of course you can do circularly if you want you can borrow them up and smash them down if you feel like either way around but outfits whatever floats your boat I want to start with 1 and 1/4 cup of blanched almond flour we're gonna move to a half a cup of sweetener now you can do 1/4 of a cup fourth of a cup of half a cup it's really going to depend on sweetness depending on what sweetener you use if you use straight erythritol it's good you're gonna have a little bit of a cooling effect but I've used something like muck fruit or either maybe one of Heidi's sweetener mixes you'll be just fine you won't get out after taste or if you're using Angulo's or as hours haul yourself a third of cup of egg white powder yes egg white powder the secret behind anything crunchy here we need illa wa kitto and lack of gluten you have to keep things as dry as possible what you want is you want moisture but you weren't enough just to allow the crumbs to stick together now if you notice typically I'll do coconut flour but I'm not doing coconut flour because coconut flour doesn't get crunchy one teaspoon of gelatin powder beef gelatin powder to be exact but a regular gelatin powder will work fine or if you have konjac powder in the house that'll work as well so you may be sitting there saying why are you using beef gelatin powder because I've been told be jealous about it makes cookies chewy ah quick sit you are correct beef gelatin powder doesn't make a chili effect it makes a sticky effect because it's College what happens in this is when you're using eggs and things like that what it does is it allows the chrome to stick together so when you're chewing it if you notice it'll stick to your teeth so it's a little chilly in this recipe the only thing we're doing is helping keep the crumb together when we're mashing it and we take the moles and we separate it out that's all it does half a teaspoon of xantham gum that is for hold as well actually the egg white powder that won't kick in until the cookie gets to a certain temperature and then the egg white powder actually formed the proteins together to help actually help with the whole of the entire cooking one tablespoon of ginger two teaspoons of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves we're gonna give that a good mix you can use either 6 tablespoons of butter or 6 tablespoons of coconut oil I have cooked it with both of them and that's to be honest I can't tell a difference in the taste afterwards actually I can tell the difference in the baking because the butter has a little bit of water in and that water does bake out of the cookie but coconut oil it's a nothing cooks out of it because you know there's no water in oil 2 teaspoons of blackstrap molasses now if you don't want to use it don't use it at all but simply what blackstrap molasses does is it helps to bring the effect of brown sugar because brown sugar is sugar with molasses in it one teaspoon of stevia and one teaspoon of vanilla extract get your hands in there mix everything around and you'll notice that it's already sticking together now a quick tip if you're looking at the dough right now you'll see how it's sticky together but the thing is the more when it is the less crunch you'll have and the more dry it is the more crunch you'll have but in my experience with this particular witness or dough as you want to call it it's crunchy just fine and then other variations will come in as far as what shapes you choose and how then you rolled the dough well speaking of rolling the dough that will be your next step here you want to roll the dough with parts from two sheets of parchment paper it actually spreads out very very easily there's no issue with it and what you want to do is when you roll it out you'll have it flat and then you'll make your mole after you make all your moles what you want to do is you want to roll the dough back up and then roll it back out again so you can get all of your cookies you should get anywhere between 15 to 17 he's like this for my macros I'm gonna do 16 cookies only but you should get anywhere within that range once you make the mole you can easily pick the cookie oh now you still have to be fragile with it because it will break clearly but you know it's not like a super fragile like you know one one little small move and you know it just crumbles no it's not gonna do that and two things I noticed one the last time I made this the cookie came right up with the mole whatever this time it was it was a little bit more resistant so you may have you may not have to deal with any resistance with yours you're gonna place these on a cookie sheet and bake them in the oven for 10 minutes we're actually 7 to 10 minutes at 350 degrees I would definitely check these at 7 minutes you don't want the edges to get too Brown Dave essentially what you're doing is you're getting you're getting the cookie hot enough for the egg white for the egg proteins to activate and then you know just to dry it out a little it doesn't have to be golden brown just a little browning at 7 minutes and you can pull those things out and allow them to sit on a cooling rack or in the pan if you would I remove mine on the pan because when I use butter some of the water leaked out so I didn't want I mean I didn't wanted to sit there in those juices or in the water or butter so you probably wonder is this cookie crunching let's see if I'm gonna play too close to the mic it's easy to hear snap did you hear the snap snap it's crunchy yeah and tastes like a gingerbread cookie that molasses really does wonders and it adds a very very little to the overall recipe please remember keto is not a food it's a metabolic state and two tablespoons of molasses it's unless you just take them straight to the head it's definitely not gonna affect you at all this kind of reminds me of my ginger beer recipe and something far better because you know just the skills that I've gained over the years then they're far more crunchy ER to see before they can get crunchy like that but anyway that's all I got if you guys got any questions whatsoever hit me in the comment section as any questions you want if you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up and I will put the full blog post below for those cookies itself you'll get the macros and everything of that nature as of now I have not calculated the macros because it's still early in the game but I would do it by the time you see this I'm teri sick let's check a free destination of YouTube and join me I'm girlfriend endo okay little sup girl hey Davis Darius boom sugarless crystals help okay look I've been following your work for a while and I'd like to do a collab with you what'd you have in mind it's the holidays I'm thinking gingerbread alright gingerbread that sounds pretty good you sure you can make that low-carb though yes I'll believe it when I see it but a house not the cookies alright gotta make it I want to see it well you just made my day gorgeous let's go thanks for reaching out to me to do this collab I love your channel and just keep making videos that other people want to see [Music]", "S74UYoDa4jA": "my hair's a mess we're gonna ignore that not gonna worry about it at all it is almost 11 o'clock at night hi everyone welcome back to my channel it is as I said almost alone o'clock at night I should be getting ready for bed but instead I'm going to make some cookies because it is the second week of the cookie collab exchange that I'm doing with life with Sheila um you're welcome to join it is an open collab and this week my cookies are some molasses drop cookies coming from this cookbook that I just recently bought it says recipes from Rosebank cottage which is a house in a museum living history museum not too far from here so anyway it's it's all old fashioned old cookie recipes so I'm gonna follow it except I don't have any eggs I don't hardly ever buy eggs because I'm allergic to eggs so I can't eat eggs on their own anyway so I am going to substitute some flax ground flax meal and make a flax egg and hopefully it's gonna turn out I don't know we'll see but right now I'll show you what I have what the ingredients are so let's see so that it's the recipe their classes cookies losses drop cookies so it's pretty simple right so this is what we need we need molasses and shortening sugar salt soda cinnamon ginger cloves allspice vinegar I said soda and flour and that is everything we need I mean you can add some raisins if you want as well you also need hot water later and so I'm just gonna start mixing this up so the first thing I have to do is cream the shortening and the sugar together oh yeah you also need eggs so I'll get my ground like sewed and I'll make some eggs oh that is the shortening and the sugar mixed together so now I'm just adding the molasses and my flax egg so I've already mixed in the molasses and the flax and now I just added the 3/4 of a cup of hot water with the soda and the vinegar and now I'm gonna mix that all together just edit the ginger the cinnamon the cloves and the allspice gonna stir them in I also added this salt when I added the other spices and stuff in so now it's time to stir in the 6 cups of flour so it's all mixed together now and time to drop it onto the pan and sprinkle it with sugar on the top so there's the first pan ready to go in the oven I just sprinkled the tops with sugar and I did actually use my fingers to roll them into balls instead of just dropping them so it's a little bit sticky but still works fine so these are going in the oven so that's the first two pans out of the oven I forgot to put sprinkle the sugar on the second pan but that's okay so now I have two more pans in the oven so this makes just over three dozen cookies so that's them there they still have to cool they're really hot so as soon as they cool down I'll give them a try alright so that is my cloud for this week if you liked it you can give it a thumbs up subscribe if you're new thanks so much for watching and until next time bye [Music]", "pd2xttt9SiE": "good afternoon everybody a little later than a because well I went out to check my chickens yesterday and I couldn't find one so I went into the coop and I'm looking under and around things to try to find her because I figured she was hiding behind something and when I went to stand up I hid right here on the bridge of my nose one of the roosting posts and it hurt and so today I have a headache and it's very very sore don't have black eyes yet but there's still time go in to touch base about our sourdough first so can you see all those lovely holes air pockets going on in there so that is the yeast and the bacteria eating up when it's posted up and it's starting to smell a little sour starting to taste a little sour - I tried it yesterday like that it yesterday I shrunk it down this morning fed it again so in a couple days probably by Monday of next week we'll be able to test it to see if the yeast has gotten strong enough that we can maybe try and break bake some bread but today we're gonna make some molasses cookies now I personally don't like molasses cookies but I make a pretty darn good cookie so one of the things about molasses cookies is it's gonna be more of a cakey cookie so last time you made that oatmeal chocolate chip and they got nice and thin and there was a crispness to the edge well this time around we want it to be a little fluffier and a little more like a cakey type of cookie so in order to do that we have to use shortening not better because shortening has a higher melting point so it's allowed to get hotter before it starts to mount and collapse so that will allow it to stay in the cookie giving it that moistness but also giving it that happiness texture so I have half a cup of shortening right in there and today my recipe makes a lot of cookies and since I don't like molasses cookies jaws the only one that's gonna eat them unless I packed them up and tell my friends that they can come pick them up and I'll leave them at the edge of the driveway haven't quite decided but regardless we're going to make half a batch so my recipe calls for one cup but I only want to do half so I'm gonna do pocket pop and we're going to do the same thing that we did with our butter the other day we are going to start mixing it but the difference is is shorting is already softer and it's already got it doesn't really need to whip up like we do with butter so we're going to add the sugar right in with our shortening and whip it together so we needed one and a half cups if I wanted a whole batch of these cookies but because I only want half a batch I have to cut one and a half in half so I know that one cup if it's in half means half a cup and 1/2 a cup if I cut it in half is 1/4 cup then if I add 1/2 and 1/4 I get 3/4 of a cup so that is what I have in my lovely bowl here so I'm simply going to add it to my shortening and then I'm going to mix this up and blend it up so it gets nice and fluffy and mixed really well and then I'll come back and show you so I'm all done with the shortening and there is our lovely shortening and sugar all mixed in it's not quite as fluffy as when you get butter in there but it's close and I know I showed you my favorite spatula before and it was green this is my favorite one when I'm working with my cookies and my mixer here because it's nice and big and yes it's pink but it's because I bought it to help with the breast cancer so I guess I can be forgiven for pink one though I don't really like pink so now that we've mixed those together we're going to add to the egg normally we would have two eggs but because I'm cutting in a half out of one egg it's been sitting out so it's at room temperature and you should always break your egg into another Bowl before you add it to your mixing bowl because if you happen to get a shell or something in there you'll be able to fish it out and it doesn't go all into what you have already so here's my egg add my egg in and just like when we did the other cookies we're going to mix this in one at a time so if I had two eggs I would do one egg mix it all in two eggs mix it put the second ad and mix it all in and that because it allows the egg to get fully incorporated without having to work two at a time it actually takes less time to do it that way than if you plot both of them in at the same time so this doesn't take very long so we're just going to mix it a little bit like that I'm going to show you real quick now it's nice yellowy color and we're going to take my spatula and I just scrape down the sides because you want to make sure everything still continues to get all mixed in and there's still a little egg that will get mixed in once I add some molasses cookies use this molasses molasses is a nice thick syrupy sugar and back in the pioneer days this was really the only sugar they had access to white sugar was something that was just starting to become part of something that could be purchased and it was expensive and they only used it for really special occasions because it was so expensive so they had molasses was usually what they went to for anything too sweet so I'm gonna blend this up and I'll be right back so I mixed it all in there you see that all nice and dark sugar and I don't know if you guys saw but we're gonna try me having a different mug every day well this is my mug today and it is square which is one of the reasons I love it because it's not a normal shaped mug the problem is when you're drinking out of it you have to drink out of the corner because if I try to drink out of the flat end it just goes all over the place because our mouths aren't straight so next after we've gotten our molasses and our eggs and our shortening and sugar all in there we are now going to put our flour mixture in so the regular recipe calls for 4 cups of flour I've cut that in half too and then 2 teaspoons of cinnamon so that means I only use one and then 1 teaspoon of salt so I use 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of ginger so I used 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and I whipped it all together so that when I incorporated all of those things are all together and four teaspoons of baking soda so I only use two teaspoons of baking soda because I want this in half so I'm going to add some because as I said when I made my oatmeal chocolate chip I don't want flour which has happened many times before we get it just started so again starting to get mixed in there some more keep my spatula and you want to scrape down the flour the sides the flours gonna try to puff up and stay on the side you want to make sure you're getting it all mixed in [Music] you can always tell as it starts to get mixed in because it starts to get thicker and it doesn't just move around you can with the blender the mixer seems like it's having trouble so there's the last of that and I'm gonna mix this all in and get it all incorporated and then I will be back alright we are back I've got it all mixed I put it in a smaller bowl because sometimes the mixing bowl can be too big and you'll notice it's kind of crumbly but it's still very moist which means it will stick together now the great thing about it's a great thing but you have to have nice clean hands when you are working with molasses cookies because you're gonna have to use your hands so I have my scoop my favorite cookie sheet and if I did no cookie sheet I would still put this on an ungreased sheet so I get my scoop so there's my scoop I want to roll it into a little ball then I roll it in sugar so that gives it that sugar coating that you always find when you ever you have a molasses cookie so there it is we're gonna do six that's how many I can fit on my pan so these are gonna bake at the same temperature as our oatmeal chocolate chip cookies 350 and my oven just beeped tell me that it was that exact temperature now sometimes your ovens might be hotter or cooler so that's why you always want to set your timers when you're baking anything to less than what it says on the actual recipe because your if your oven is too hot it's gonna cook faster and if it's too cool it's not going to cook fast enough so you need to kind of test that out there and you always have to be able to know so here are our six molasses cookies coated in sugar sitting about two inches apart because they're gonna spread but these are gonna be more like cake so they're gonna be they're gonna get puffy instead of nice and flat and round and I will see you guys back once I thank these all right they baked for 12 minutes the recipe said anywhere between 12 and 15 so you have to be really careful here they are and I made them little so you see they're nice and puffy and cakey you let them sit on the pan for about a minute just so they don't crumble and fall apart and then the bottom of them that is perfect and you don't really need a spatula you just need something to be able to push them off onto whatever it is you're gonna pull them on now I pull them on a metal rack because that allows like this because it allows the air to get up underneath as well as around the whole thing so it can cool evenly but you could just lay it onto a dish towel or something along those lines so that it can cool it just might get a little moisture or a little softer underneath because that's where the heat isn't allowed to get you're not allowed to get rid of that heat because it's sitting on top of that towel so I'm not going to taste one because I don't like them but I am going to break one apart so you can see the inside wave nice and cakey that's what that shortening does board if we had used butter it would have gotten flatter the cookie would have been flatter would not have been as puffy if we had mixed butter and shortening we would have sort of gotten halfway in between marks so it would have had some poke to it but it was still flattened out a little and gotten a little more crispy on the edges so some cookies like snickerdoodles I will mix the shortening in the butter because I want both parts of that I want to kind of crispy but at the same time flatter and softer in the middle which is what shortening will give me butter gives me the crispy so there we have it molasses cookies which I don't like but my husband does so he'll eat them and maybe I'll package them up and share them with a few people who have told me that they like molasses cookies too depends if I want to get in the car and drive around or not but I will keep my distance talk to you guys soon bye", "TlJV2j4R7bA": "[Music] hi I'm Gail and welcome back to Gil's low-carb recipe ideas and my blog is low-carb recipe ideas calm today we're going to make a low-carb gingersnap cookie now I have not tried this recipe yet so we're gonna do it together and I got the recipe from dr. Gundry he sends me emails all the time and every once in a while he'll throw in a recipe and the last one I think it was the chocolate cake in the cup to microwave and it's absolutely delicious so I'm praying that this one's really good I don't get paid anything from dr. Gundry I just want to share with you that I loved a lot of his products and one of the products that I knew is use as a prebiotic which is really awesome and primal plants which is really awesome and I use all his facial creams I love them totally love them they just do amazing things they make my face so smooth and I just thought I'd share that with you because I am using his recipe and and he's got some pretty good stuff anyway let's get started and we're gonna make this little carb gingersnap cookie the first thing we're going to do is put in a quarter cup which is 55 grams of salted butter now he is using unsalted and he's using grass-fed French or Italian butter or you could use coconut oil well I'm gonna use salted butter in this case and it's melted okay the next thing I'm gonna put in is 1 cup of powdered urethra tall now I always powder my urethra tall as soon as I buy it in bulk I'm putting in the food processor and making it powder just because it's so much easier to work with it better than leaving it in the crystal form okay the next thing we're going to do is I'm going to add in one egg my eggs are from the farm I'm glad I kind of stopped up because I'm not even sure if I can get them right at the moment since we're homeward bound and I hope everybody is being healthy staying healthy enjoying your family oh gosh it's been a crazy world right now and I just pray that everybody safe now the next thing we're going to add in is one teaspoon of almond extract and we're going to add in some fresh ginger now it's two teaspoons of sorry it's one teaspoon of minced ginger and I bind my ginger Aarti in the jar it's just so much of a pain to be to be trying to grade it I just do not enjoy trying to grade it it's such a mess as far as I'm concerned it just seems like too much effort so I'm going to just mix this all up I'm going to set it aside and we're going to work with our dry ingredients that's mixed well okay so now I'm going to get another bowl and I'm probably gonna be totally confused as to which spice is which because a lot of them look the same so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to put in two cups of almond flour which is a hundred and ninety two grams that was an easy one I'm only gonna put in an eighth of a teaspoon of salt because I put in salted butter okay the next thing we're gonna add in is a teaspoon of baking soda and two teaspoons of ground or yeah ground ginger most of my spices our Clubhouse prices the brand new and then we're going to add in 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of ground allspice see I've left a little bit of the cinnamon in the thing okay we're just gonna mix this all together I just find it works so much easier to put all the measurements in the ball so I can demonstrate to you guys as to what I've done instead of taking all the time to measure while I'm on the video just so I can see if I can make our videos a little shorter and they'd still come up with an amazing product okay I get this all mixed and then we're gonna add in the wet ingredients I'm gonna do this all by hand I don't think you have to but that's what I'm doing with this okay I think that's mixed well so now let's add in it's quite thick get it all cleaned up here there we go okay let's mix this all up might take me a couple of minutes here so I'm gonna work on this now I've decided I'm gonna use my hand I'm a hands on girl as well just so I can really make sure I've got it mixed nice this actually doesn't totally do the trick mmm smells good I hope we get some really good result from this okay now I think we've got that mixed really well and we're gonna put them on the cookie sheet I like using my my silicone mats when I do my baking nothing sticks I just absolutely love them on the baking tray here now my daughter bought me this for Christmas I haven't used it yet hopefully I can make it work properly first time around you always say they're so great so we're going to take a scoop look at that oh that is so much easier than me rolling I quite like it and they should be all consistent in size oh this is plenty if you haven't got one I I'm gonna say I recommend it that's really cool okay I'll fill up the turns and I'll be back with you I love that scooper it is amazing so I ended up exactly like the recipe says I got 24 if you can see there's 24 altogether but what I'm gonna do is I think I'm going to just out of curiosity they say don't press them down or anything so I'm just gonna press the last few down and I just want to see what the difference is in its as appearance so it's going into the 350 and it says between 12 to 15 minutes so let's get baking the first batch just came out of the oven they look lovely and that was 14 minutes I timed it 12 and then I added a couple more minutes on there so here are my milk our gingersnap cookies now the ones that I pressed down I left him in for 14 minutes and they got join me but we're going to take a bite and you can see what the difference is and this is the one I just scooped with my little scooper and didn't press them down great flavor hmm really nice flavor no I always thought gingersnap cookies we're hard and crispy these aren't hard and crispy so I think I just called my ginger cookies and I do get the flavor of the erythritol at the cooling sensation I quite like it it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside very good really really liked it so now we're gonna do the one that I press down and it got a little darker so this one's very crunchy has a small small coolness effect from the erythritol it's very good it's quite crunchy compared to the other so I guess it depends on how long you bake it really good so anyway they're from dr. Gunn Driss email that I received quite tasty I quite like them now if you'd like this recipe you know like some of my other ones I'd love for you to go to low carb recipe ideas calm and try this recipe and try other ones now down below my video there's a subscribe button if you could subscribe that would be awesome and like my video that would be awesome anyway you take care everybody stay safe and be healthy and we'll see you in the next video bye now", "sQ0Ko19MY4A": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "4embtQ2Dxj0": "Hi Everyone, I'm Gemma Stafford, professional\nchef, host of Bigger Bolder Baking, and the very proud brand ambassador for GoodCook.\nRecently on this channel I've made things like a peach and blueberry crisp, a chocolate\nrice pudding, and a maple and pumpkin pie. Right now it is cookie season, and I'm gonna\nshare with you a recipe for an incredible ginger crinkle cookie. As always the recipe\ncan be found on GoodCook.com along with all of the information about the GoodCook tools\nthat I use. Okay, let's get started in a nice big bowl. Add in your flour, brown sugar,\nground cinnamon, ground ginger, baking soda, and salt. And then mix these ingredients together.\nSo in case you don't know what a crinkle cookie is, it\ufffds very commonly chocolate and eaten\naround the holidays. It has this beautiful lovely crackly top, and they're kind of chewy,\nand kind of almost fudgy on the inside. This is a really nice festive version of that with\nthe ginger and the cinnamon. So our next ingredient and a super important one in cookies, is room\ntemperature butter, you want to make sure this is nice and soft. So the reason we need\nour butter so soft is because we\ufffdre gonna mix it by hand. And what we\ufffdre gonna do\nis with a whisk, just whisk it until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Now you can also do this\nstep using a machine, however I think doing it by hand is much easier. And faster. So\nyou can see right now because my butter was so soft that it\ufffds breaking up really easily,\nso this is exactly what I want. Once you have it all mixed gonna give it a few more stomps.\nThere we go. This is looking fantastic so now we\ufffdre gonna add in our wet ingredients.\nSo into here we\ufffdre going to add in our molasses, also known as treacle. Molasses is a really\nimportant ingredient here, it gives you almost like a gingerbread kind of flavor, ginger\nand molasses are like best friends, so these work really well together. If you don't have\nit however you can substitute it with honey and that will work too, but try to get some\nmolasses. And then next we\ufffdre going to add a little bit of milk. Then with a spatula\njust mix it together until it forms a dough. This is a simple recipe that can be done by\nhand, and do you know what else? Little hands. Kids love this recipe. So you might have some\nelves in the kitchen. So here's a little bit of cookie 101, when you're making any cookie\ndough it\ufffds best to chill it, when you chill it it\ufffdll keep its shape, and it will just\nbake so much better, so I'm gonna pop this into the fridge for around 2 hours, let it\nget nice and cold and then we\ufffdre gonna scoop it. So there's a few things you need to make\ncookies, you need a cookie scoop, and you need a cookie tray. So the reason that I love\nthese cookie sheets is because they actually come in a bundle of 3, so when you're shopping\nfor the bakers in your life around the holidays, you can get them cookie sheets, you can get\nthem a scoop and maybe a cooling rack, things like that, it will just make for the best\nChristmas present. So this is GoodCook small cookie scoop, it makes perfectly sized cookies\nper portion, you get a nice big bite. So here I have my powdered sugar this is what we\ufffdre\ngonna coat our cookies in, now all I'm going to do is get a nice big scoop, pop it into\nthe powdered sugar, toss it around, then put it on my tray lined with parchment paper.\nSo just keep going with all your dough, scooping and coating, scooping and coating. As you\ncan see the size of the cookies I'm making are a little bit more than the scoop. I just\nfeel like that's a good two bite per person. So if you don't wanna bake these off straight\naway you can put them in the fridge or even in the freezer to bake them off at a later\ntime, however I'm gonna pop these guys into the oven. So you wanna bake your cookies off\nat 350\ufffdF/180\ufffdC for roughly 14 minutes, now there is a sweet spot with the cookies,\nyou wanna bake them just right so they're still chewy in the middle. So here is my secret\nabout baking cookies, only bake off 1 tray at a time, even if you're using a fan oven,\nit\ufffds really best to put in 1 tray at a time, you'll get the best results, you'll get the\nright texture, when you put in 2 sometimes you don't get exactly what you're looking\nfor. So this is why we call them crinkle cookies, just look at how beautiful they are and that\ncrackle on top, and if you look down you can actually see that they are a little bit chewy\nunderneath, this is exactly what we were going for, they look amazing and they smell incredible.\nI like to enjoy these while they are still warm. Oh my gosh. You got that lovely spice\nthat reminds you of the holidays, it\ufffds a little bit sweet, a little bit sharp with\nthe molasses and everything in there, if Christmas had a flavor, this would be it. If you don't\neat them straight away, store them at room temperature in an airtight container for up\nto 3 days. For this recipe and lots more information, head over to GoodCook.com, and happy holidays.", "sz1fUApRDhY": "today we are going to make my almost oatmeal molasses cookies I call them all because there is no molasses in them but they taste like it that delicious we're going to start out by blending our first five ingredients and I want to I want to explain why we use these as we go along this recipe has no free fat it has no refined sugars everything all the ingredients are whole foods and the reason for that is the whole food has all the fiber and the nutrition that you need to keep your body feeling healthy and to give you the energy the sustained energy that you need that you won't get from from the refined foods so first of all we're going to start out by adding our water we add 1 cup of water to our blender then we have one can of green pitted salt cured olives now with these you want to make sure that you get the kind without your scrutiny which can be a little hard to find these are only so cured they don't have anything you're in them so you want to put both in there our next ingredient is flaxseed and this ingredient here is LaBrie home bar this ingredient is a substitute for your eggs then we have one vanilla bean and put our head on we will start at a low temperature low speed and then gradually increase the speed so that we don't make a mess and so that our small ingredients are fine thieves will blend well so here we go now that that is smooth we can move on to our dry ingredients you know we have a few minutes we have the bar we need right now we need a cup and a half of our phone then we have date sugar this is date sugar it is a whole food it is just ground up dried dates one of the sweetest dates which is the bar high and it just delicious and all kinds of recipes back in our Bowl this will speak up to date center and we have our rolled oats that is three cups of rolled oats we have a mixture of cardamom and coriander which are together they make a nice cinnamon substitute you don't want to use something because it's irritating to the digestive system so we have our cardamom coriander we have a half a teaspoon of salt and stir our dry ingredients together we don't want forget one up yeah the shock walnut and we also falsa i usually use raisins but today I thought I would use some bride cheering to have a little flavor to it we want to stir those then before we add our wet ingredients yeah we make our little well in the center where our liquid is going to go and then we just pour them stir that together since these cookies are a whole food you will not be having a craving for sugar that you normally would get with regular desserts regular sweet the nutrition in them is you have complex carbohydrates and you have the sugar that is broken down gradually and it is sustaining to your system and you're not going to have that I sugar up sirs and then a big dropping in your blood sugar level like you would with regular cookies so with these you can eat these and they will give you a sustained level of energy that will take you from one nail to the next without that urge to snack we're going to put these doesn't happen and coconut people need to raise for 30 minutes and they'll be done so you may be wondering why you'd want to eat our cookies our whole foods cookies rises in the recipe that you already have well let me explain some of that first of all since it is a whole food we don't have the white or brown sugar or the white flour that would be in a regular recipe the reason you don't want those is let's break down quickly in the body causing a glucose problem yeah but the glucose pohang glucose enters your bloodstream causing a blood sugar spike above normal your body wasn't designed for that and your body will produce large amounts of insulin the insulin takes care of the high blood sugar then that leads to weight gain the weight gain of course of the problem and within an hour or two after you your insulin has taken care of sugar then you have the low blood sugar drops that makes you feel faint and great and you start having those cravings for sugar again thus you repeat the cycle with the whole food unrefined food that we have in this recipe here you have the whole grain flour in the whole date as we showed you the whole all is they break down slowly those preventing the spike in your blood sugar levels and give you that that burst of energy but then afterward is followed by the weakness and tiredness and and the feeling of needing more snacks another bonus that I'd like to share with you this is one of my personal favorites is that it doesn't have eggs so you don't have to worry about cholesterol and you can eat the broth cookie dough because it doesn't have a sound in hell of it you have with eh mmm No you", "Zcw76rb8eBY": "[Music] hey guys I'm there for Mama and today I'm going to show you how to make some elasticity I love it boom baby so here's a little backstory on where this recipe comes from and why we're making it today as a child I used to go over to my great-grandmother's and we would sit around her table in the kitchen and she would pull out these big box of cookies that she'd had pre-made she heat went up and we'd have them with a glass of milk in her kitchen and enjoy these delicious cookies over the years I missed those cookies because the recipe has somehow disappeared and I'm hoping my Nana has a knack our cookbook but I still haven't got my hands on that so for now we're gonna try this recipe that I got had a friend's hook book from like the nineteen I'm guessing it's 1940s 1950s I couldn't find an actual like production ear in it however it's really old and you can tell just by the wear of the book itself so this is first off molasses cookies and I will leave a description of the recipe in the description of the video and in the comments you guys can tell me if you recreate the recipes as well and then what you thought of it alright so look at this cookie recipe tea on the roll here we're gonna go ahead and increase the heat the oven to 400 and that says add the flour ginger cinnamon and salt so we have two and a quarter cups and then I'm reading this recipe off from a picture I took from the cookbook so this is why I'm looking over here ginger so on a teaspoon of ginger teaspoons be measured and teaspoon of cinnamon which is pre measured quarter teaspoon of salt gotta get our salt on see what else ok so we're going to mix that together squeeze this here and sister all right then it says this all of soda which is the baking soda in hot water so I have two tables you'll see two teaspoons of baking soda dissolved in two tablespoons of hot water add that here next up so I'm missing the baking soda in the hot water to dissolve the basis okay then it says to mix the shortening sugar molasses and egg until very light and fluffy so I'm gonna grab a second Bowl not in game okay is that our second Bowl for the mix shortening so 1/2 cup of soft shortening - used program rayandpaul vegetable shortening which you could use Crisco absolutely name brand I just have this one and for today okay and then a half cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of sugar here and a half cup of molasses this dark brown rich yummy goodness I think my favorite part besides the chewiness of these cookies was my grandma rolled up outside and sugar so they always had this dark brown cookies with this really pretty white sugar olive green with the cracks in it before also it and then we're going to add the egg so 1a and we're gonna beat back together until like the it's gonna get noise [Music] [Music] the consistency you want it to be okay so now we're going to mix the flour mixture alternately with cold water okay or an alternate back for me so we need six tablespoons of cold water Oh Jake don't have cream address fast okay so what I did is I grabbed a bigger bowl fill it with cold water and I'm just going to scoop each tablespoon as I alternate between with the water and the flour able to go down at a time [Music] okay so I am all done fixing or fixing mixing the batter and I've added the dissolved baking soda if after I was done with the water and the flour mixture combo so that's all done it's all been here mixed up and we're gonna go ahead and get it ready to go in the oven okay so here we are I'm getting ready to swim in the oven the recipe calls for one teaspoon full rounded two inches apart on the baking tray I'm gonna stick them in the oven for I want to say it's ten minutes 12 minutes so we're gonna stick them in the oven for 12 minutes and when they're done I will show you what they look like all right they're done let's see what they look like soft the touch all right so I have to wait for these to cool just a few minutes and then I'm gonna taste one and see what they taste like and if they're anything close to what my great-grandmother get to taste one of these beautiful Brown goodness morsels morsels of goodness the way I remember them which I was going to try something is that they had sugar over the top of them so I'm gonna I don't think this is how she did it though I'm just kind of put sugar over the top a couple my thought is that she baked dipped them in the sugar haldeman sugar before she put him on the pan all right so let me grab a spatula and let's taste one of these oh they're hot [Music] you're not bad I think anyway I think they need to be cooked a little bit less than the 12 minutes that it says so I think on the next batch I'm probably gonna cook for maybe 10 minutes instead of 12 and see how that goes but flavor-wise they're similar I think although she probably rolled them in sugar before she baked them because I tried pouring sugar over the top it's not the same effect that's okay this is all trial and error so thanks for watching today and catch the recipe in the description and try it for yourself thanks [Music]", "0gVBBVADrxQ": "hi welcome to mr etzel's cooking class i'm anne hetzel the teacher's mother now when i was a young child one of my favorite cookies was a soft molasses and that's cookie and that's what we're going to make today here we go [Music] do [Music] once you have your area all cleaned off and wiped down you need to get a large mixing bowl the bowl we are using is a large glass mixing bowl we have a wooden spoon here you're going to be using a variety of tools to do this and so the first thing we're going to do is kind of cream our butters and our sugars so we are taking our room temperature butter we've had this sitting out for a couple hours just so it can adjust to the room temperature and we're going to put it into our large glass mixing bowl here and even before we add the sugars by creaming them with the butter which creates a lot of air that will trap into our butter which will make our cookies very fluffy is we're going to mix up our butter a little bit just get it all mixed up really nicely in there inside your bowl with your wooden spoon now if you do have a kitchenaid mixer or similar mixer at home you can use a mixer by all means you may also need to employ the help of your good friend the silicone spatula and the silicone spatula is really great and useful as it can bend in ways that the wooden spoon cannot you can see here my mother is mixing the butter into the bowl as well just kind of getting it ready so that when we do add the sugar for the creaming process the process goes very smoothly so now it's time to add our brown sugar and this brown sugar as we measured it we really packed it in tight to the measuring cup so that we do get that exact measurement and we're mixing it in here using our wooden spoon looks like mom switched to the spatula there whatever is her preference and back to the wooden spoon so there she goes she's using the wooden spoon there to cream the butter and the sugar now if you had a kitchenaid mixer this would go really really quickly but we don't for all these purposes here so we're gonna mix this by hand so i'm gonna let mom do her thing and cream together the butter and the sugar after your butter and sugar have been creamed nicely you're going to add in your egg and you're going to stir this now the egg is also considered what we would call a wet ingredient just like the butter the sugar and then a little bit the molasses and they are wet because as you can see in some of the ingredients they are literally wet but also the ones that are sugar like if you were to touch sugar you would say wow this isn't really wet it almost feels dry but sugar attracts moisture it attracts water so we consider it a wet ingredient so at this point in time we are mixing together all of our wet ingredients in anticipation of adding the final wet ingredient the molasses now that we've got our sugars creamed together with our butter and our eggs it's time to add in our molasses and molasses is essentially the dark syrup it's sweet and it's a byproduct of the sugar cane process of making sugar from sugar cane it's very very sweet and this is going to add the majority of the sweetness to our cookie mother has switched to a metal whisk to incorporate all the ingredients together evidently the wooden spoon and the spatula provided was just not good enough she needed the power of that whisk to incorporate all the ingredients together before we add in our dry ingredients so as you can see the color is starting to change it's starting to mix together the dark browns the molasses with the light browns of the brown sugar the butter and the egg as we are preparing to add in our dry ingredients mother here is just taking the spatula and whipping it all together one last time cleaning off the sides of the bowl now it's time to add in our dry ingredients so we're going to do here folks is we're going to take our flour which is our first dry ingredient and we're gonna add all the dry ingredients into it starting with the baking soda after the baking soda we're gonna add in our cinnamon has a nice taste i'm a big fan of cinnamon we're gonna add in our ginger ginger's gonna come in next there it is the ginger very healthy for you and we're going to add in the cloves next which is the secret family ingredient is the cloves this is going to give our cookies a nice bite so we are using a it looks like we've switched tools again we're going to be using a very small wooden spatula here and we're going to mix together the dry ingredients we are going to add in our dry ingredients now and we're going to add a little bit at a time you can imagine if you had your dry ingredients split up into thirds add about one third of the dry ingredients at a time and then take your spatula and mix everything together nicely as you can see here my mother is using what's called the folding method or instead of like stirring something you know almost like a soup you're folding in from the bottom in so folding down and in down and in and this prevents the gluten formation which happens when flour is hydrated with water it'll form the gluten which will make your your which can make your cookies very tough and chewy so instead she is gently folding everything together as she is adding in the flour [Music] once it has all been mixed together thoroughly you can stick them in the fridge but first it looks like my mom is going to put in a smaller bowl possibly to save on fridge space you know so that it can fit better in your fridge and so just get it all out of there and put it into the bowl and so after it's in the bowl we're going to cover it with cling wrap commonly referred to as saran wrap or plastic film and first before we do that you know just clean off your spoons that's why the spatula is really important you want to get every little piece of cookie dough off of your equipment and into the bowl so that you can enjoy it in your cookies so we're going to take that plastic wrap and get this thing wrapped and get this show on the road it's going to sit in your refrigerator not your freezer your refrigerator for at least one hour to chill but you could do this the next day it'll stay fine in your fridge for up to three days if you decide to hold off on baking them [Music] you're going to prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray this way your cookies do not stick spray it in and wipe it with a paper towel let's make some cookies we've got some table sugar here to roll our cookies in i'm using a cookie scooper if you don't have one at home you can just use a measuring spoon about a one tablespoon measuring spoon will do and we are essentially just scooping out our cookie dough and our cookie dough is chilled so it's going to roll nicely it's kind of a nice spread without spreading too much in the oven because the dough has been chilled so we've rolled it into a ball dipping into our sugar getting the sugar coating all the way on the outside and then just kind of pressing down a little bit as we put our cookies into the cookie tray leave at least one inch of space between each cookie and looks like we're ready for the oven there goes mom she's she's got a smile on her face because she's excited for those cookies she's got them in the oven [Music] let your cookies rest between two to five minutes on the cookie pan itself so that it can cool down so that when you lift it off to put it onto the cookie racks it will not fall apart [Music]", "PHx3fyxCff8": "okay 12 today for our Christmas baking we're going to make some ginger molasses cookies and the first thing you're going to want to do is set your oven to 350 degrees you're going to cream one and a half cups of shortening once that's done you're going to gradually add in 2 cups of white sugar next we're going to beat in two eggs and a half a cup of molasses okay and here is our wet mixture all done next we're going to add in all of these dry ingredients so we're going to do we read my instructions here four and a half cups of flour for large for large teaspoons of ginger two teaspoons of baking soda one and a half large teaspoons of cinnamon one large teaspoon of allspice and a quarter teaspoon of salt so we're just going to put them all in here and then mix it all together okay here it is all mixed together as you can see it's a little crumbly looking so what you're going to do is you're going to put some flour on your counter and then kind of just work the dough together in your hands to make it into a nice ball once you've done that then you're going to want to roll it out um but don't roll it out too thin you want to leave it thick I'll show you after I've done it how's things I think it's about a quarter-inch thick white thick and you can do whatever size you want i'm going to give a lot of these awakes it's quite a large batch so i'm just using an egg cup for little thick round cookies and you can see them here see they're quite they're quite thick so that's what you're looking for nothing thin otherwise they're gonna be crunchy it isn't thick they're going to be nice and shoot here they are so the key to keeping these nice and chewy is not to overcook them so we're going to put them in 47 minutes and evaluated them here they are perfect seven minutes you see they're starting to crack at the top those are perfect so then you're going to take some sugar right away and you're just going to start to sprinkle sugar on top of the cookies right on the pan because then we'll transfer them to the cooling rack but it's just a lot cleaner just to put the sugar all over the parchment paper as soon as your sugar is on your cookies you want to trash them right away to cooling rack because you don't want them to continue to cook on the cookie sheet plus you only have after that I only have four minutes until my next batch is done so i have to hurry up and get my other cookies on mother sheet and just keep the train moving here they are they're all done so this recipe with cutting them with the a cup I got 97 of the little beauties oh my going to so many but they freeze great and we just take them out when we want to eat one with the tea or coffee and yeah we also you know when we go to Christmas parties and stuff we end up bringing these a lot or giving them as gifts son years I make a few batches at these because they're people's favorites so they love them anyways I hope you like them enjoy", "nERXXJXixLs": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "DXWUHpdYGAo": "hey friends and welcome back to the 12 days of Christmas cookies today we're making a molasses cookie first we're gonna take two and a half cups of flour and add our spices of cinnamon ginger and nutmeg then with a whisk mix all those ingredients together until well combined just to make sure there's no cookie without any spices then you're gonna take 3/4 cups of shortening and mix that until a little bit fluffy and then add in 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar mix these two ingredients in until well combined then crack in one large egg mix that a little bit and then you're going to add in half a cup of molasses once your wet ingredients are well combined then you want to go back to your flour and spice mixture and mix that in this is a thicker dough but continue to work with it once everything is well combined you want to take a small cookie scoop and roll the dough into a ball in some granulated sugar and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 8 to 12 minutes I feel molasses cookies are a Christmas staple in the south and they have a gingerbread taste and would go perfect with some coffee or even some eggnog we'll see you tomorrow for another cookie recipe [Music]", "DBIlSj5T5V4": "i'm good you like it oh can i have a bite hey everyone welcome back to my channel thank you for clicking on this video if you are new here my name is kelsey and i have a two-year-old daughter named hadley and today's video is a bake with me video um which i've been making quite a few of this holiday season if you don't know this i did go to culinary school for pastry arts and i love baking i love eating sweets so if any of that interests you i'm going to make more of these types of videos even after vlogmas is over so anyway today we're going to be making chewy ginger molasses cookies here are all the ingredients that you're going to need and it's got a little bit more on the ingredient list than your average cookie but it is very very much worth it for the ingredients you're going to need all-purpose flour baking soda ground ginger ground cinnamon salt ground cloves dark brown sugar vegetable shortening butter regular sugar molasses one egg and some chopped crystallized ginger the first step is to measure out your flour and add that to a medium-sized mixing bowl then you're going to add your baking soda then you'll add the ground ginger and then you're going to add your cinnamon and make sure that you check the expiration dates on your spices because i think like oh i know i had to get new ground ginger but it's funny because you know we buy spices and then you forget about them but they do expire and they lose a lot of their flavor um in that process so check your dates before you make them because you want to make sure that these cookies taste the best that they possibly can to the dry mixture you're also going to add some salt and then your ground cloves i did not have ground cloves i had whole cloves so i just used my microplane and added that after you're finished with the dry ingredients you can set that aside and add your butter and your shortening and you can see what happened to my tablespoon there you can add your butter and your shortening into your mixing bowl i also had to buy shortening because nothing that i bake ever calls for shortening but i forgot that this recipe did so anyway then you're just gonna mix that up for like a minute and then add in your white sugar and mix it up again for a minute or two and make sure that you're scraping down your bowl and then add your packed dark brown sugar and it smells so good the smell of the brown sugar is so good and then you just let that mix um for about 10 minutes or so i'm usually doing about like speed three or four when i'm creaming my butter and sugar sometimes if i'm in a pinch for time i'll like crank it up to the highest speed um so then i add my warmed up egg if you watch my other videos you know that i leave it in a bowl of warm water and let the egg come to room temperature and mix that scrape down the bowl add in your molasses the recipe called for light molasses i just bought this molasses i it didn't say light on the bottle anywhere but this is the one that i used um last time that i made the recipe so i decided to just use it again and the molasses also smelled so good and i'm pretty sure brown sugar is just sugar with added molasses if i'm not mistaken so both of those things smell so delicious so after that is all set you're just gonna add your dry ingredients i add it in two batches to avoid it spilling out um of the mixer and yeah scrape down the bowl scrape down the bowl as you can probably see here um like the bottom of my bowl had chunks of flour and just like pieces that were not incorporated so make sure you're scraping down your bowl after every step then you're gonna chop up your crystallized ginger um the last time i made these cookies i didn't really like crystallized ginger but i tried it again this time and i thought that it was pretty tasty so you just need a half a cup of that chopped up i thought i would see if hadley liked it so here she is eating it trying it she likes it she likes it she's probably tasting the sugar um on the outside and then she's realizing uh no because you know ginger is very strong pungent so she did not like that and the look on her face is so funny she didn't like it at all once she um got past that sugar crystallization on the outside all right moving on you're going to mix in your candy ginger just until incorporated and then you have to chill your dough for one hour after the dough has chilled you're going to get a small plate and put some sugar on the plate and then for the dough you it calls for two tablespoons worth of dough rolled into a ball so i did actually measure it out with the tablespoons because i'm selling these cookies to somebody so i just wanted to make sure that they were uniform when i'm baking at home for myself i really i'm not so precise i don't really care that much so it's up to you if you want to do two tablespoons but it does make for a much more uniform cook like you know if they're all the same size so i would suggest to just you know measure it out with the two tablespoons it's not that big of a deal um so yeah then you just roll it in the sugar place it on your tray and bake it the recipe called for 350 350 degrees for exactly 14 minutes and it was literally perfect exactly 14 minutes 350 rotated halfway through i let them cool on this tray once they were out of the oven for like three minutes and then i moved them over to my cooling rack to fully cool and here's what they look like once they're fully cooled down they did flatten out a little bit once they cooled down um but they honestly came out so perfect and tasty let me see i'm good you like it oh can i have a bite no i might a little bite no please no if you've made it to the end of the video thank you so much for watching i truly appreciate it um and i really do recommend these cookies i'm not just saying that because i made them and they're on my channel but they're so tasty the texture is perfect they're chewy um the outside of the cookies are so like a little bit um crunchy around the edges of the cookies it has chunks of the crystallized ginger in it and they're just super flavorful delicious they're perfect for the holidays because of all of the spices and i just highly recommend them so thank you guys so much for watching and we will see you in the next video bye", "vo6UFjKh3V0": "okay so that's it zero oh you are good spot-on today is a really big day in the genius kitchen because we have one of the great geniuses of our time Rosalie the berimbau is here to join me showing us a recipe from this incredible cookbook that just came out and without further ado please welcome to the stage the great rose - I think we should just dive right into the cookies so that we can talk about what makes them so great I should explain Kristen that recipe was originally given to me when I tasted it that used Crisco shortening oh really I mean when I made it with butter it just wasn't the same it didn't have the cracks it didn't know the chewiness because shortening doesn't have any water so I thought well I could get the flavor of butter if I clarify it and get the water out of the butter that was my secret and now it's just as good texture but it also has the butter flavor did you just think to yourself okay I can do butter if I clarify it but then were you just kind of like and I might as well brown it while I'm here so that it has more it's a labor you know you've got [Laughter] thank you for reminding me I got I wasn't distracted by the butter which is appropriately talked about Julia cuz she always said when something wasn't quite right more butter will help you know so we were on the same page that's for sure now it isn't foamy anymore now you can actually see this the brown solids clear it's clear so use American style unsalted butter and that way you'll have the right amount of moisture come off when you're clarifying and browning it and it'll give you just the right amount of the also you you really have to get those cracks and you don't get it when you have water in it see I don't hear any bubbling anymore so I think all the waters burned off so I would say since I'm seeing all those brown specks I'll take it off rather than go too far so that has to cool down luckily we have some already that's been cooling because as you say in the book in one of your baking girls it can't be higher than 80 degrees or you or what happens well for one thing it won't air a quits in the same way and also it will cook the egg when you put it in I've been taught never to pack an egg on the side of the bowl because it could break the yolk and also you get eggshell and just wrap it on a counter and then hope that it's 50 grams and it isn't we need 38 actually oh we're doing 3/4 I'm hey thank you for reminding worse so now what we will do is we'll take out the extra and of course I'll take it out from the white so I think we can just start mixing together dry ingredients right next thing to do it's so hard to switch to left-handed if you're right-handed actually I'm ambidextrous I can Jennifer I didn't realize it until somebody else said oh you're ambidextrous I said doesn't everybody use both hands but the thing I'm not I can't do with my left hand is chopsticks I mean not on the piano but using and this is the cinnamon clove and ginger did it take a while to stumble on exactly the right yes no spices no that was what was given to me but the right amounts the amounts that I preferred probably something that I did by testing I knew how much butter to use because I knew would be the same weight of shortening since they weigh the same when you just have a the fat content the rest so for the wet ingredients were gonna get the stand mixer I'll grab it okay so all of our wet ingredients are just gonna go in here [Music] do we have a little flat blade or like an offset spatula or a spatula Road knife to dislodge this it's easier oh this is my favorite I go everywhere with it although sometimes the airline's does not let me go everywhere we want well they said it's a weapon and I said yeah it's the weapon to the pastry chef and the TSA guy said yes my grandmother is a pastry chef I understand but I'll get punished if I let this through I couldn't believe it I don't want to take risk losing my spatulas looks beautiful you can see now how there's no streaks it's basically it's like caramel so now we're putting our flour mixture in the first time I taught my niece how to bake was in California she was sitting on the counter because she was just a little girl and she turned on the mixer everything ended up on the counter and she almost started crying and I said don't feel bad this is how you learned I really think baking is the most perfect thing for teaching kids because they learn patience and philosophy art science math just everything I can't think of a single thing they don't learn can you know I'm gonna go chill these so that we can save them for later but we have some that we already made so that would be ready to roll I'm gonna go trade them out real good to be ready to roll thank you okay so only bringing back half of our chilled dough since we're keeping the other half in there as you specify yeah and also this is going to make 12 which will fill one cookie sheet and I don't like to bake two cookie sheets at the same time because the oven is nevers even you have to switch halfway turn it half way around top to bottom better just that they don't take that long to bake so you notice we'll just do one of the time how do you like to portion these you'd like to do with my weight usually I'm guessing yeah absolutely and see how close this one comes to the 20s we 323 mm-hmm oh that's beautiful wanted to run sure I would look to see well now that you know you need a little extra just don't plan at all just maybe see what we get here okay so that's it zero oh you are good spot on okay I'm gonna stick these in the oven okay so while those cookies bake let's and take a little tour of your book I'm always ready to revisit it oh good this is the first time I've gotten this and I didn't know about the color that was something my editor chose but the miracle is that the name of my cooking school four years and my business is Cordon Rose which means pink ribbon look what I got a pink ribbon marker I get the chills telling you this because it means so much to me I also have an in addition to the baking pearls in the front of each chapter there are all the things that I think of that could possibly go wrong that you might want to be warned about beforehand this is the first time in your books that you've done step by step photos like this yes I've had a few step by steps in the books where it was needed but this has every single recipe just about has the steps and it really enables me to see what the texture has to be they look amazing they smell amazing they lovely crooks I just love this should and lovely sparkles superfine sugar on the outside mmm and now he gets a taste and they're not fresh from the oven they're but they're the perfect warmness I think I hope I forgot how good these are so if you want more genius recipes be sure to LIKE and subscribe

"OxA_ZfH6rI8": "hi guys it's me Savannah and this is my second video of making my delicious treats that are very egg and peanut braids today I'm going to be making ginger molasses cookies these are so delicious and very chewy they are so delicious and these are how this is how you make these cookies so you'll need flour baking soda and baking powder and these are the spices that I use there are ground ginger ground cinnamon ground nutmeg and ground cloves and you'll need margarine sugar molasses and a little bit of water and for it and the things that you need will be a whisk a spatula a cookie scoop 2 trays and a stand mixer with the paddle attachment so let's get started so first it is 2 cups of flour and then you're gonna add the baking soda and baking powder 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of baking soda and you're also going to add the spices and it's 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of ground ginger a teaspoon of cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 a teaspoon of cloves and then you're just going to mix these all together okay now we're going to go to the mixer so you're going to add half a cup of and sugar this is one cup of sugar but in the actual cookie dough it's 3/4 of a cup but I have a cup in here because there's a because after you roll the balls of dough you roll it in this kind of sugar so I'm going to take a quarter cup of it out and then I'm going to add this amount of sugar and then I'm going to add the molasses it is half a cup of molasses and then and then a tablespoon of water mix this until it's smooth and all combined [Music] okay now gradually add the dry ingredients these wet you can just add the whole thing but I like to add it gradually so I'm using a quarter cup scoop [Music] [Applause] [Music] roll it and then you're going to put it on to the tray and then just do that with the rest of the cookies and after I'm done doing this first tray I'll show you how to freeze them because this makes a lot of cookies and and there's a certain way that you could freeze them and and I'll show you how to do that when I'm done making this first tray of cookies so now I the tray that I was going to be baking it's in the oven right now at 350 degrees and they're going to bake for about 10 to 12 minutes and now I'm going to show you how to freeze them so you do the exact same thing before and then and then and then when you're going to freeze them you freeze them for about 30 minutes to an hour on a tray covered with wax paper and then after that you're going to put them into a bag and freeze it again wait and then and then and then you can freeze them again and you always want to freeze them on the tray first because if you freeze them in the bag they'll just smush together and make like like like one combined and and for these you can have them close together when you're going to freeze them but when the ones that but the ones that you're gonna bake you need to have them spread out and that's to freeze and I'll show you how to do it when they're done breathing for for about thirty minutes or so okay so these are the companies that have been baked and these are all cool but there's still a tiny bit warm but that's okay and these ones just came out of the freezer and they have been freezing actually a little bit less than thirty minutes it has been only about 20-ish minutes and now I'm going to transfer these cookies onto a cooling rack using the spatula and after I'm done putting these on I'm going to show you how to bag these to freeze them more and it doesn't really matter how long you freeze them for because you can freeze them for like a long long time and ask and also after that I'm going to try one of these cookies and then when you're gonna and then when you're ready to thank them you just take how many cookies you want and then just bake them how you usually would and now since these are all done I'm gonna try one of these cool so good thank you guys for watching I really like you to try this recipe please subscribe I'll have more videos coming up and and I'll see you guys again soon bye", "Nz0ho62vT-g": "hello everyone welcome back to cooking with Donna today I'm gonna make up some cookies I'm thinking ahead I'm waiting for fall already more already barely in June just about but I've been making up these cookies for a while and they're just a really good everyday cookie but you don't gotta wait for fall you know fall you look for those you know those warm spices and everything and these are some good ginger raisin iced tea cookies with a little bit of molasses in them and they are very thick and chewy soft addicting cookie I'm going to tell you that right now they're very very good so I wanted to let y'all know what you're gonna be needing I almost did it big boo-boo a while ago I must put Comino in here I'm glad I checked that but you'll be needing a teaspoon of cloves and I have a teaspoon of cinnamon in here and a teaspoon of ginger here I have a cup and a half of raisins I have a teaspoon of a teaspoon and a half of baking soda a big tablespoon of cornstarch I have some salt there some baking soda some brown sugar some white sugar some eggs some butter some molasses I think I named out everything you're gonna be needing here and of course your flour but we'll go over that as we go but as of right now what we're gonna do is get our butter we're gonna do two sticks which is one cup of some real butter real butter is going to be the key to these margarine for some reason I mean it look like I've said before if that's what you have use it but do chill your dough you have to chill your dough guys all right I had your rearranged things this thing I have here trying to hold this but just in my way all right okay I have a cup of butter soft butter and I have here three quarter cups of brown sugar 3/4 cups and a half a cup of white sugar and we're just gonna mix this until it's incorporated you got your beater get it out I like to do it by hand and I'll get this mixed up and beat up for about a minute all right I got my three quarter cups of brown sugar and my half cup of white sugar creamed in with one cup of butter all right now we're gonna add two whole eggs room temperature you can stir them in one at a time but I'm just gonna get this mixed in their eggs brought to room temperature just until it's mixed general budget okay all right now I'm gonna be adding two teaspoons of vanilla extract to that and this is just gonna be a one bulb in here don't need two bowls okay let me get my flower now on top of this you're going to be adding in three and a quarter cups of flour oh I'm sorry I forgot to mix in my one of the stars here quarter cup of some molasses this is flavor right here and this is gonna give you a such a good stop and if any of you guys out there don't care for molasses you don't really taste the molasses you just taste the warm spices give it a try please if it's a very rewarding cookie be proud of yourself get that mixed in there now any cookie that has an excessive amount of brown sugar and molasses it's gonna be better the next day I always call my cookies 24-hour cookies even though they're not it's just after 24 hours they taste better because I like to use a lot of brown sugar and now it's like I'm using a quite a bit of brown sugar and molasses so tomorrow these cookies are going to be super moist and they're really thick oh right this cookies are good for cookie swaps or especially the holidays come on they are they're the best they just scream fall when you smell these cooking all right so I'm gonna get in my flour now we're gonna do three and a quarter cups scooped and leveled your flour don't don't add too much flour here you want to level it properly scoop it fluff your flour up then scoop it and level it lightly don't pack it so we're gonna go three and a quarter cups three and a quarter okay all right we've got that get this out of the way now show that on top of that I am gonna add 3/4 teaspoons of salt I have oh excuse me a teaspoon and a half of baking soda 2 tablespoons of cornstarch come on out of there and I have the teaspoon of ginger the teaspoon of cloves and the teaspoon of ginger so it's 1 cinnamon 1 teaspoon of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of clove and one teaspoon of the ginger I just have a mom mixed up in this little cup here get that mixed up just kind of stir it in lightly on top before you add it all in the creme de mixture you can see my shirt I just barely started stirring it and just flop all over my Minnie Mouse or Mickey Mouse shirt all right that mixed up in there just like that just lightly you know so you don't got to use two bowls just mix it right on top just stir it in like that okay now I'm gonna start stirring it all in just smell those spices love it and then when I get this halfway mixed here or just before it all starts coming together I'm gonna add my raisins cup and a half of raisins love love love raisins just give out a beautiful texture chew to these cookies we're gonna get some nice icing that's gonna firm up on top of these cookies oh yes they're gonna be good so I have this just about mixed up once I get this completely mixed which we're just about there I don't want to over mix my dough here and that's it that's mixed up so now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put this in the refrigerator I'm gonna let that set for at least an hour and then we'll get these cookies going all right I got my dog chilled up for 30 minutes to an hour if your interview I did it the quick way I put it in the freezer for a half-hour that works you know justjust good fit normally I just pop it in the fridge for about an hour just to that dough firms up real good all right now like my other cookies I like big cookies you're gonna get two in one but for these I do quarter cups quarter cups scoop it out with your fingers or get you a spoon to dig it out of there I don't like them little scoops they're just too too small but I'm gonna do them like my other ones get it you're gonna make a tall cookie so you're gonna make it like a log roll it like a little log and see there and you're gonna put this on here and kind of press it so it stands because you don't want it falling over see how it's tall like that if you make it round it comes up more of a flat cookie this is how you're going to achieve that thick cookie so I'm gonna get these get these all on my ovens preheated to 350 I got this lined with some parchment paper and I would say probably between 14 to 15 minutes but I'll see where we're at once I take these out well I'm still waiting on the oven I thought it was preheated but I actually heard my microwave beeping so it wasn't my heaven but I want to jump back down real quick I got eight I think on here yeah but eight cookies because they're pretty big they're those but um these cookies I wanted to bring up to I'm glad I caught it I always make my cookies in the middle rack because I don't like the thick cooked crust on the bottom where it's pretty thick inward to the cookie I like it even cooked and it does make a big difference on the texture of your cookie so I do the ten minutes on the bottom or maybe eight minutes on the bottom and then I move them to the very top rack that way you're going to get even cooking and not just that big thick brown cooked hard bottom so do even cooking eight bottom and then whatever minutes that's gonna finish at the top now these cookies like like my blueberry cookies these are gonna look underdone do not overcook them because they're gonna firm up really well a few hours after they cool down and by tomorrow they're gonna be super super good so don't overcook them they're gonna look a little undercooked but I would say these are gonna cook probably about 14 minutes but like I said I'll let y'all know all right those cookies you're still cooking but I wanted to come back and y'all can go ahead and get your icing started while those cookies are are cooking but here I have two and a half cups of powdered sugar time to sort of packed into the cup and leveled off two and a half cups and then with mine I ended up with a quarter cup and one tablespoon of milk now it's gonna vary on what you're gonna use with your milk depending on your your powdered sugar how old or how dry it is you know but you do want it thick you don't want it then at all you want it thick see there and I'm gonna put that like in two you could actually dip the cookie and take it and set it to cool but I like to drizzle just put it in a ziplock bag put a little snip at the end of it not a big old cut just a very little one and drizzle it all over that cookie when it cools but we'll get to that but that's all this is is the milk 1/4 and one tablespoon of milk to two and a half cups of powdered sugar and you do want it thick and I added one cap of the butter flavored vanilla if you often see that I don't want to want to lose focus there but if you can't find that go ahead and get the regular clear vanilla or you could use the brown regular brown vanilla extract use what you have it's just that clear makes it nice and white on that dark brown cookie so cookies you're still cook one more tip I wanted to show you guys so it's not so hard getting it into that bag just get yourself your drinking cup put your cut your ziplock in there and there you go you don't got no mess you don't need nobody to help you hold the bag open but that's the easy way of doing it for those are not familiar with this little trick alright Joe I got him all baked up now I wanted mine a little bit thicker and I rushed so I didn't really refrigerate mine long enough now I'm gonna show you the difference and because I did them different sizes I'll explain to you this is the first batch I put in can you see that didn't come out as thick as I wanted because I didn't show my dough long enough now look at this look the size of this one see that's what happens when you don't chill your dough so that is very important plus I decided that's not big enough so I went with the third of a cup and I cooked this exactly 18 minutes I did 10 minutes in the middle rack and then I scooted my right to the top and I let it cook an additional 8 minutes now the oven times gonna vary but like I said these cookies are gonna feel like they're underdone but do not over bake them until you think they're done they're done within 18 minutes if like I said ovens very yours may take 20 minutes but don't cook them 25 minutes thinking they're still doughy because they're done they're gonna carry overcook and as they set they firm up so they are gonna look like they're underdone he's got about maybe another 10-15 minutes of cooling and I'm we're going to get that icing on them but if you want to go with this smaller cookie this one this took 15 minutes the quarter cup the large ones a third of a cup took like I said 18 minutes yours may take 17 minutes it may take 20 minutes but I would think no longer than 19 to 20 minutes they are done all right I'm gonna get a few of these drizzled I just put some of the icing in a bag just like this just cut the tip of it off and then just go around him but I'm gonna get these all iced up do them however you want this icing will set up on them just like that and just let it sit I'll finish up here and we'll be back all right yo there they are just wanted to show those to you they are done now storing these what I like to do is a line output okay I'll get a couple of like regular on nine by 13 cake pans that way you don't have to stack these because if you stack them see there you can see there that icing is nice and firm on them but that way you don't have to stack them to disturb the icing put them in a couple of cake pans and then I'll put some saran wrap over that cake pan and seal them up good cuz either these are for tomorrow anyway because I always make them a day before that way they set and get nice and moist now you're gonna think you know they're a little firm around the edges but these are gonna soften up as they set but that's how I store them and they are delicious cookie and I hope you guys enjoy please like and subscribe as always and until then we'll another wonderful [Music]", "-IgBwZga3Z0": "in this video i'm going to show you step by step on how i make my sugar cut out [Music] cookies [Music] is take this [Music] if you can't keep this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] hey y'all welcome to sweden myra this is kansey here with sweden mirror sweden mera is where we provide our clients we custom made cakes and desserts from scratch if you're new here welcome and consider subscribing to my channel and do not forget to turn on the notification button so that you know when i put out any new content i will start by creaming my butter and sugar together save for about four to five minutes make sure that your butter is at room temperature and if you want to know how to determine a room temperature butter make sure to check my video on the perfect vanilla cake so now you want to scrape down now i'll be adding all of my wet ingredients and all i have for my wet ingredients are the egg almond extract and vanilla extract and i'll beat the wait until disappeared into the mixture be sure to check for all the ingredients that i use for this recipe down in the description box below now i am adding all of my dry ingredients and what i have for the dry ingredients are the flour the baking powder and the salt so i'm adding the dry ingredients bit by bit to avoid the dry ingredients from splashing all over the place and also to properly combine [Music] so give all of the ingredients a quick mix and make sure not to beat for too long [Music] now you want to scrape down you want to use your spatula to put all of the dough together and then wrap up with a clean wrap and toss into the [Music] refrigerator [Music] do [Music] i usually keep my dough overnight into the refrigerator but um if you don't have such an amount of time on you to put overnight you can leave your dough at least for two hours into the refrigerator before cutting out okay here i'm using the dual slicker mat and it comes with several rulers to help measure out the height of your dough so as you can see i'm not using a swirl no extra flour or anything on that underneath my dough it's just the dough and the silicone mat because it prevents the this liquor marks prevents the dough from sticking so it makes my cutter cookies so easy make sure to check the description box below i will list out where i bought the body [Music] if you're learning something here make sure to give this video a big thumbs up [Music] i'm also using second mat to bake my cookies this is to prevent your cookies from burning [Music] do [Music] now this brings me to the end of the video and i'll see y'all on the other side thanks and god bless [Music] so [Music] you", "K9i883NztfI": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make ginger cookies and this is what they look like this cookie is aptly named because not only are they ginger colored but they're ginger flavored and they're also sweet and buttery and I really love the soft and chewy texture of this cookie so when we make the batter if you have an electric stand mixer like I have here use your paddle attachment or you could use a hand mixer or really you could just use a wooden spoon and the first thing we need is one cup which is 225 grams of butter and have your butter at room temperature and you could use salted or unsalted as you know I prefer the flavor of the unsalted but either one whatever you have in the house and then what I just want to do is just soften that butter until it's nice and smooth now this batter it makes a large amount of cookies about 48 which at least in my house is about a perfect amount because these will disappear quickly and you can also freeze them which is great so as always you know scrape the bottom and the sides of your bowl as much as you need to and now we're going to add our sugar you will need one cup which is 205 grams of firmly packed light brown sugar and then I'm just going to beat this on medium high speed just and we want to get a little bit of air into our batter so until it's light and fluffy that's probably if you have a stand mixer about two minutes okay so this is what we're looking for it's kind of got a little air in there and it's all nice and creamy smooth so just good scrape here so now what we're going to add is two large egg whites which by weight is about sixty grams and have that at room your egg whites at room temperature and then I'm just going to add a little vanilla extract if you prefer not you can leave it out just a half a teaspoon which SPO one gram and then we need to add some molasses I like to use the unsalted molasses and I'm using a light it has a little milder flavor of course if you want a more pronounced molasses flavor you could use dark and you will need a quarter of a cup 60 milliliters or if you want to go by weight that's about 90 grams and when you measure out molasses because it's so sticky what I do you can either lightly oil or I just spray the inside of my measuring cup and that way it should at least it comes out fairly easily as you can see it doesn't stick makes life easier so I'm just going to beat all this together hmm so that molasses really starts to color our batter that pretty ginger color and don't worry if you have a little bit of curdling because that is we did add a lot of liquid it'll your batter will smooth right out once we add our flour so you will need in a separate Bowl 2 and 2/3 cups of which is 345 grams of all-purpose flour or you may know that is plain flour and then what we're going to add when you ginger of course ginger cookies 1 teaspoon of ground ginger which is 2 grams and 1 teaspoon 2 grams of ground cinnamon and a half a teaspoon 1 gram of ground cloves now you could adjust the amounts of your spices to your taste if you don't like ground cloves you fees either you know ease that off or just leave it out right one little more ginger flavor you could add more or you know especially with adults if you want you could cut up some crystallized ginger and put that in here and then you will need 1/2 a teaspoon 2 grams of salt I like to use a kosher salt because I find it has a little milder flavor but you could use a table salt if that's what you prefer and then you will need 2 scant teaspoons about 10 grams of baking soda so now I'm just going to whisk all of this together you want to make sure it's all mixed in all those spices and the baking soda salt otherwise you can get clumps especially with the baking soda because if you get clumps it you'll like get a slight bitter flavor which we don't want in our cookies so now I'm just going to add all my flour here and I'm going to mix it in now I like to have my mixer on low speed to start because I don't want that's a lot of flour and I don't want to come in up in my face okay I can't really smell all the spices so good you will find it's really difficult to eat just one of these cookies so now I'm going to give this just a quick stir still some flour on the sides of my bowl so now what we need to do is as you know you can see this is a really soft batter right now and we need it chilled because we're going to roll it into little balls to bake our cookies so what you want to do is just cover and place it into the refrigerator and since this takes about an hour at least you could do it longer or even overnight what Rick and I are going to do is we're going to go for bike rack because st. Simons Island is just so bike friendly unlike the big city and lots of great paths the drivers are so courteous it's like such a treat and then I get to look at all the nice houses or the cool-looking houses in the neighborhood so when we come back we will bake our cookies so once your batter has been chilled and you're ready to make your cookies pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is a hundred and eighty degrees Celsius and then you will need a couple baking sheets and you can line them with Tarquin paper like I've done here or you could either just lightly butter them or spray them with one of those nonstick cooking spray and then you will need to form your batter into about 1-inch balls which is two and a half centimeters or what I like to do which I find easiest is I just weigh my batter and for each one I use about 15 grams of batter and if you do that that way you know every one is the same size so that they all bake at the same amount of time so either whichever way you prefer and then just roll it and then what we're going to do is in a separate Bowl have about one cup 200 grams of granulated white sugar and then you're just going to roll your batter just completely coated into the sugar and then put it on to your baking sheet like that and then space each one up you know about two two inches apart because they will spread it's about five centimeters okay our last one roll it in the sugar and then just take a glass and I just put sugar and then we're just going to flatten our cookies just a little okay and so now how long do you bake them well of course everybody's oven is a little different and it depends how crispy or how soft and chewy you want your ginger cookies my family likes some quite soft so I find about eight to ten minutes and what you're looking for is the outside of the cookies is you know firm to the touch but in slike in the center there's still a little soft so about eight to ten minutes kay are ginger cookies are done now you will notice some cracking on the top that's way it's supposed to be and I like I said the outside is firm but yet the center's are still a little soft so I'm just going to let them cool on a wire rack in the pan for a couple minutes just so they can firm up and when we come back we will try one okay so we're ready to try one it's a really great tasting cookie it's sweet its buttery and then you have the flavor of the spices which actually I find the flavor that spiciness actually comes out even more after you store them overnight but still really good I'm soft and chewy so good makes them and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "_G1GIEZ8AfQ": "yum if you could have umami in a cookie then this cookie has it because they just oh they're so deeply flavored hi i'm susan spungan and today i'm gonna make one of my all-time favorite cookies that i'm semi-famous for and they're called triple ginger chocolate chunk cookies they're the perfect cookie for this time of year as a kid my absolute favorite cookie was a ginger crinkle it was made with actually vegetable shortening these are made with butter and i thought adding chocolate to that cookie would be amazing and it was first thing that's important for this is to measure your flour correctly now it's two cups plus two tablespoons i fiddled endlessly with the amount of flour which is really important to a cookie two cups plus two tablespoons and now we're just mixing all our dry ingredients which are going to be ginger of course okay one and a half teaspoons now you know spices that's like a flavor thing so put a little bit more or less of something if you really like it that's totally fine so quarter teaspoon of cloves cloves are really really strong so they're good but if you put too much it will really overpower the flavor you want to put a little cardamom in you could a teaspoon of cinnamon you'll notice i level the spoon with my finger as it's coming out the easy way to do it i'm skipping the salt because i only have salted butter today so i'm going to just leave the salt out and see how it is one tablespoon of cocoa i love this cocoa you want a dark dutch processed cocoa especially when you only have one um one tablespoon and that just adds a little bit more depth of flavor it's a triple ginger cookie so here's the second ginger we already put in the dry and now we're putting in the fresh and then finally we're going to add also crystallized ginger so you just want to i like to put it on a small plate like this so i can catch all of the juice and all of the flavor that's in this ginger now i usually just estimate a tablespoon and i'm usually right let's see we're gonna set this aside anyway i actually jumped around and this is what i do all the time that's about tablespoon but i'm gonna set that aside because i actually didn't finish doing the dry ingredients the baking soda is the leavener in this recipe we want two teaspoons and it has the molasses to act as an acid to act with the baking soda you don't need baking powder in this recipe just with a whisk or a fork whatever you have doesn't matter just mix it up so we want one and a half sticks of butter and like i said i only had salted butter i have a lot of salted butter and i kept thinking well what am i gonna do with all this salted butter and then i thought well let's just use the salted butter in the cookies i like salty cookies anyway not super salty but so i left out the half a teaspoon of salt that you would normally use there so we're going to use the paddle which is in the mixer i didn't see it there we go cream that [Music] i'm gonna put my two-thirds of a cup of brown sugar can be light or dark whichever one you like or have or prefer and i actually really like that they're packing the sugar in bags rather than the bag in a box that you forget about and then it gets hard and even better if you have an airtight container but okay two-thirds of the cup and we're gonna cream that together until light and fluffy so this is not a lot of stuff for such a big bowl so you definitely have to scrape once or twice you can see that you've got dark and light parts i can't emphasize enough how important it is to scrape when you're using a mixer we're going to add two yolks um make sure i don't make a mistake in my own recipe and probably save these egg whites for breakfast or whatever the yolks and the ginger i'm gonna put in and i'm gonna mix that briefly all right gotta scrape and i'm going to add vanilla next all right so vanilla molasses are next now for this recipe this is really the molasses you want to use the most common one you're going to find in the grocery store grandma's unsulfured original molasses here's a little trick for measuring molasses one that i really like so take some cooking spray take your measuring cup and give it a good spray we want how much molasses are we putting in half a cup so this will just help it kind of slide right out of the measuring cup pour this out and you're gonna see that most of it will slide right up that's just a little tip i think it works even better if you have a metal measuring cup so let's mix those things up as you can see it's getting that gorgeous um kind of chestnut brown molasses color that i love so much and it smells amazing i love the smell so i like using these um gear deli bars which you can get always pretty much in the supermarket in the baking section and they're four ounces they're not three and a half ounces and they're not three ounces so it just makes it easier to measure because they're each one is divided into eight pieces so you can eyeball what the weight is very easy to do even if you know so if you don't have a scale i have a scale but i don't even weigh it if i if i know i need eight ounces i just need two of these so and you want fairly big pieces now we're gonna add our flour like i said i like to jump around so um i'm gonna add my flour but be careful to get it all in the bowl not on the counter so now we're gonna start our mixer in a really low speed whenever you add dry ingredients super low speed so that it doesn't fly out of the bowl [Music] and once it starts to kind of congeal you could up the speed a little bit but we don't really want to over mix this so this is a bench scraper comes in handy for so many things you'll see later i'm going to use it when i separate the cookies but whenever you have to move chocolate around it's just you know your hands are warm so if you just picked it up with your hands it's gonna just melt all over your hands crystallized ginger you want about a third of a cup all together but again not super important the exact measurement of this because and you might want to leave it out all together i think it's like one of the wonderful features of this cookie look at that third of a cup okay we're gonna throw this in there and while the bowl is down i'm gonna give it one last scrape get that flour on the side all we're trying to do now is just mix this stuff in evenly this part would be a little hard to do if you don't have a machine so i would actually suggest using a heavy spoon in a bowl if you were doing this by hand because all you're doing is mixing them in and that is it you want to make sure that it's well mixed so and you know just give it one more mix in the bowl just to make sure that it's really well just everything's well distributed sometimes the bottom of these mixer bowls can hold a little bit of butter get most of it out in one swoop and then scrape whatever's left okay so you want to chill this for at least two hours until it's firm i usually do it overnight nice package like this and i'm going to go ahead and put this in the fridge and then i have one in there when you know it that i made before so here's the one that i made before i actually used half of it already to make some cookies but here we go with the other half it's nice and chill you can see it's much firmer than it was before now i like to bake one sheet at a time if i can and just the oven it's just a little more reliable you could make two sheets at a time i know it's a lot more convenient but and it'll work it just might take a little bit longer than the 10 to 12 minutes that the recipe stayed so you always have to go with your own oven so i like to weigh the dough on this one an ounce and a half is going to be good for each cookie so you want to break off some dough and you know as you go you're going to see like oh well there's a big chunk of chocolate you know make sure you kind of get that in and even on top one and a half ounces exactly oh you want to roll it with your hands so it's fairly round it doesn't have to be perfect it's good if there's some places where the chocolate is kind of poking out and you were rolling it just in granulated sugar i'm going to do six on a sheet so they have plenty of plenty of room believe it or not we're gonna roll these in sugar one more time after they these are gonna go in the freezer for 10 minutes and then we are going to roll them in sugar one more time so i'm going to put this sheet pan in my freezer and then i just happen to have some that i put in the freezer a few minutes ago i'm gonna give them another quick roll in the sugar and you see how much whiter they are after that second roll you can skip this if you don't want the extra sugar but you might as well go all in at this point for the sugar right it's the holidays live a little so these take like 10 to 12 minutes we're gonna put them in the oven i'm gonna set my timer for ten and keep an eye on them so about halfway through we're gonna turn around the sheet pan let's take a look at how these are doing in the oven there as you can see they're just sort of melting down from their lumpen state to a flatter state so these have gone for 12 minutes let's see how they look i'm going to give them one little whack [Music] which i always do actually they look pretty amazing that's a warm one just jumped into your mouth again i did it jumped into my mouth you", "w19zbfaVbuo": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz this is the first time you're stopping by and for the rest of you guys welcome back and thank you so much for your support you guys are truly truly awesome so as I promised for November is gonna bring us holiday recipes for baking and so what was the holidays be but without Gingerbread so today I'm going to show you how to make these cute adorable gingerbread people and or you can just make regular cookies totally up to you but I'm going to show you how to make gingerbread cookies now this recipe cannot be used for gingerbread houses gingerbread houses Earl is a far stronger and more stable type gingerbread I am going to do a gingerbread house to bring that recipe to you as well so this is different do you can't make gingerbread houses alright so saying that I'm gonna jump into the ingredients what we need to make these guys and we'll get these puppies babes alright so for our gingerbread cookies our gingerbread people whatever it is that you'd like to make the ingredients for this are two and a half cups of sugar now you may need an additional half a cup so keep a little extra on hand but basically about two and a half cups is what we should need and we're gonna go with a quarter cup of can of butter and three tablespoons of shortening now shortening will make your cookies softer so they're not going to be as hard and crunchy they're gonna be a little bit softer and nicer cookie to chew if you don't have shortening or you don't want to use it you can absolutely just use some regular butter or three tablespoons of regular butter totally up to you but I recommend one with the shortening you're gonna want one egg at room temperature three quarters of a cup of brown sugar now it can be light or dark and again that's up to you I prefer the light there's enough molasses in it but if you like that more real rich taste as I cookie then go with the dark brown sugar you're gonna want a half a cup of molasses blackstrap molasses I know there's a bunch of different kinds so blackstrap molasses for our spices we're going to use two tablespoons of ginger one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of clove ground clove 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and 1/8 of a teaspoon of nutmeg we're going to need 1/4 teaspoon of salt 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of vanilla so that's what we're going to need for the cookie recipe then for the royal icing you're gonna want about one and a half to 2 cups of powdered sugar sifted 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar and two to three egg whites and they need to be you can use the liquid egg whites in the carton or the regular egg normal eggs or the dehydrated egg whites you can use and you can also use meringue powder totally up to you basically all works exactly the same for this all right so let's jump into our equipment and let's make some ginger cookies alright so for our equipment you're gonna need a hand or stand mixer obviously the bowl that goes with it you're gonna need all three attachments your whisk your paddle and your dough hook you're gonna need a whisk an extra bowl a rolling pin yes that's what these are called and some saran wrap or a plastic wrap and if you're doing multiple colors of your royal icing just have some disposable bags just makes life easier or if you know how to make up those easy one that paper I don't someone needs to teach me anyway the number that you're going to need for the colors your baking sheet lined with parchment paper or those baking sheet or awesome and a cooling rack and that's it for our basic main equipment as always I'm probably sure I forgot it one or two things but anyway let's jump right in let's get these cookies made alright so the first thing we want to do is to put all of our spices into our flour and mix that out thoroughly so that our spices are all evenly distributed through the flour and you're not getting any hunk of one particular spice because that's never a nice taste I'm just gonna throw them all in here and I'm just gonna whisk that together until they're all well mixed and you can tell cuz you're gonna have a uniform kind of color there it's not gonna look patchy or anything it'll all kind of have that brown a slightly Brown look and even you don't want to see any kind of white patches and make sure to go right from the bottom okay looks good alright the very first thing we want to do is to us always cream our egg and butter and in our our egg butter and sugar going to be topping my butter and my shortening and the one I did is I just put this on the stove there on the go just to eat it up a little bit just so it's partially melted it helps with the shortening cuz you're shortening is a little bit stiffer than your butter and in goes our sugar and our egg on those tile attachment and we're just gonna blend that together on medium until it's all well whipped together and it's a look in this nice and fluffy yes about two minutes and don't forget to scrape down your sides a couple of times through all right so use consecutive lemon on until it is nice and smooth and looks nice and fluffed up a bit they're nice and light next is gonna go in our baking powder our vanilla and I'm gonna mix those two together we can also add in the salt and again scrape down your sides it's so good smells awesome all right next it's gonna go in our molasses and we're gonna blend that so mix that up until the molasses are all well blended in you can easily shift your bread and again don't forget to scrape down your sides alright once we've got all about nicely blended and is going to go in our flour and we're also gonna switch out our paddle now for our dough hook in goes my flour so I'm adding the two and a half cups all at first and if I need more than I'll add an additional half a cup or kind of what we need so I'm just putting that on low or medium low I'm sorry we're gonna put that on low and let that bring all the dough together and again just pop down your sides so don't look it's nice because you can work down the sides without having to stop it every time just be careful though keep your spatula right to the side now if the dough is a little bit dry let's see if it's coming together a little bit dry you can drizzle in about a tablespoon or so of molasses so I'm just gonna drizzle in a little bit more and I'm all over the dough like but not too much you just want to get a little bit all over here now if you find that it's still a little too dry after you've added that bit more on molasses you can add a 1 to 2 tablespoons of melted butter the nut should help finally bring it together so again it's not a real pliable dough but it has to stick together that's a fine line nice much nicer alright so now it's coming together a lot better we're going to take it out we're just going to knead it a little bit so to get it formed into a nice ball here and then we're gonna wrap it up and put it into the fridge for four hours or overnight so see you oops see how it is dry but it is sticking together it's that kind of fine line all right so you're just gonna need your dough for a couple of minutes like I said till it's nice and it all just comes together in a nice ball and once you finish kneading your dough you just cut it in half it's a former into a ball and then we're just going to roll it out a little bit into a disc and wrap them up really securely with saran wrap and the reason for putting them into the disc is it makes it easier are they cool quicker when they're nice and even a little flatter and it makes it easier for us to roll once they're cooled just going to roll that out into about a 1 inch disc and get your saran wrap and I usually do about two or three sheets around and make sure that there's air tight so I do that with both of my balls of a dough and is that gonna put those into the fridge for four hours we're gonna make up our royal icing and then we'll be able to roll out our cookies and get them baked up all right so for our royal icing we're going to add our two or three to three egg whites now a couple of things it's very important if you crack your eggs to make sure that there is absolutely no yolk in it if you get any yolk whatsoever they will not fluff up so you need to start again with the with your equipment and your bowl also has to be completely clean there cannot be even a trace of grease or fat in it otherwise your egg white so again will not fluff up any protein will cause them to fail so if you're finding that they're not fluffing up that's likely the reason we're gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of cream of tartar or two teaspoons of your of lemon juice your lemon juice touch our whisk attachment or the whippy thing as I like to call it and we're going to beat these on high until they come to a soft peak so you're gonna whip it just to about this texture I can get this off soft piece so you just hold it up and it just these kind of very soft once you've got it like that we're gonna add in our powdered sugar so as I said I'm adding in two cups to start we may need another half a cup to a cup depending on for the texture with royal icing it's not a hundred percent exact always so I'm just gonna blend that together on low and again make sure to scrape down the sides of your bowl okay now to check your texture you take your spoon or a knife and you cut through your icing and if that you want it to not completely fill in so it starts to fill in really quickly it's too runny and we want to make it a bit thick thicker you want to make sure that it doesn't fill in or if it does fill in it's at about fifteen seconds or longer that'll be a good piping icing right now we've got a good flood icing what I've got right now so I'm gonna add a about another half a cup of powdered sugar to start here now now see now it's too sick it's really day it's such a pain this stuff I'm not gonna lie it's a very fine line between your flood and what you want for your piping so I'm just gonna add in a couple of spoons of water here to get to loosen that up a bit so again you want to just do it very slowly one to two teaspoons at a time otherwise you're going to be playing the sugar water game for a really long time I'm just diving in a teaspoon first see how that's gonna go all right so it's still really thick so I'm gonna add in about two more teaspoons I'm just gonna keep doing that until I get that right texture I'm just gonna scrape down my size that's looking a lot better so it's still a little too thick for piping so about one more teaspoon they think of water should take care of that for us that's just a little too thick that looks a lot better let me just check that yep that's perfect perfect texture there so you want it to so then it flows a little bit sticky but it still flows it doesn't just hang in midair so that's a good texture for piping so I'm just gonna split this up I'm just gonna do simple one just white ones with a little block for the eyes other than that you can get fancy you can make a couple of colors if you like I'll see how industrious I feel but I think I'm gonna keep it simple all right so I'm just gonna slip this off balls they don't need that much for the block so I'm just doing a little bit for the block the rest of it is gonna keep white yeah I'll do a little bit red do some red to some buttons yeah easy wait for a piping or if you got bags is getting a tall glass and it'll fit over like so just really helps with them with not making a mess get in Scooby down you're very nice twist what I usually do is I usually use twist ties so I just use any twist ties that I've got on hand just makes life easier now my black cutter way more black than I wanted but although the nice thing it with royal icing to store it to keep it yeah I'm you just put plastic wrap over but make sure that the plastic wrap is actually sitting on the on the actual icing so you place it right down have it sit right on the icing that protects it from drying out and developing a skin on the top and since it's holiday time I'm sure you'll get to use it up so just before you get ready to roll out your cookies you want to make sure to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees all right so now it's time to roll out our dough and water roll it out to a quarter inch thick now for those of you who are not good at rolling like myself there's these awesome rolling pins they've got these disks on them that allow you to go to the exact size that you want there so I've got the quarter inch disc on there and which will allow me to roll this out to a perfect quarter inch all over so I'm just gonna roll out my dough and it's always good to go from the center and push out I'm just gonna get my little gingerbread cut cutter and you just cut it your cookies just cut away the excess dough we just pop that little puppy oh and put it on then put it around the cookie sheet and then with your act with the excess dough just put it back together re-roll it out again to a quarter inch and continue cutting out your sheets until you use a ball your dough and then you start working on your second disc or if your pan is full or bake that up first and and then work on your second one you're gonna bake them at 350 for about 10 minutes or until you can just touch push down on them and they and they stay or they bounce back but it doesn't stay as an indent then you know that they're done now if you are fighting it is a little bit sticky on your spatula or your working surface you can just sprinkle a little bit of flour and that will help with that and put it on your knife as well I just stick my knife in it like so so I'm gonna just finish rolling that out and we'll get these puppies baked up yeah so the flour makes all the difference in the world there so definitely put a light sprinkling of flour on your work surface and that'll avoid some stickiness for you know they just could they can just pop right out much easier alright so I'm just gonna pop these into my preheated oven for about 10 minutes if your cookies are a bit smaller if you're just making cookies like a gingersnap type thing but it'll be about seven minutes but if you're doing a regular type gingerbread size or a larger size cookies it'll be about ten minutes all right so our cookies are done so you're gonna leave them on the rack or on the cookie sheet for five minutes then you will transfer them to a cooling rack to allow them to completely cool before you start decorating you cannot decorate on a warm cookie all right so now it's time to decorate I'm just gonna change the camera angle down so you can see the decorating closer alright so for my first one I'm just gonna do a very simple one just wait without the block for the eyes so you're just gonna cut a little a little bit off of the end just cut the tip you want to keep it small but so that it enough comes out that's good so just gonna make some eyes so for piping what you do is you hold it at the top of the bag and this down here is just for guiding you don't do any pressure then you just apply an even pressure as your icing comes out and then you release your pressure when you're done but again you don't push you don't add any pressure with your second hand it's just a guide and there you go you just have just a simple ones for a simple design there you go and oh I wanted to add the block for the eyes just gives it a little bit more they don't look so blind I'm gonna try and get a little dot right in the center like so I'm just topping that down so the block kind of goes blends into it a little bit and there you have it see how much cuter he looks with the block for the eyes so now I'm gonna do one with red do those eyes first make those ones a little bit bigger and there with the red just adds a little bit more fun to it so again if you're really good at decorating giddyup you can decorate as fancy as you want but if you're not a great decorator you can get to keep it really simple and still looks like a great gingerbread man well there you go kind of three different way whoops wow that was almost epic you have it so you got three different ways so that is my little demonstration for you on gingerbread cookies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate

god these smells so good [Music] sometimes the batter will look as though it's getting a little bit dry if that happens which is happening to me it just adds a little triples of almond milk or your plant milk just a little dribble is to loosen it up again because we do have some flour left over just still added I wish you guys could smell this [Music] all right and just to kick it up a notch as we like to do here on Rollo vegan let's add some crystallized sugar to the tops of our cookies just to give it that little edge you know so let's get moving the oven at 350 degrees anyway so the baked

hear from you guys so until next time stay healthy my friends", "E9vlXAEUCtc": "hey guys it's Natalie today we're making one of my favorite cookies I got a request for a roll out of all gingerbread cookie months ago and it's finally time to share them so we are making gingerbread men but of course with this dough you can make gingerbread anything and they are vegan gluten free and oil free so we're starting with dates and big surprise about 10 to 12 pitted medjool day and one in 1/4 cup of oat flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder I'm not really sure where the rest of that clip went but it's one and a half teaspoons and then of course the fresh ginger I really think that fresh matters the ground stuff just isn't quite as good in this recipe so about a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger and then one teaspoon of freshly ground cinnamon 1/4 cup of coconut sugar I tried making another coconut sugar and they just weren't quite sweet enough for me and then 2 teaspoons of lemon juice now of course you need molasses so this is 1/4 cup of molasses and then process all that in your food processor until it makes a dough now the first time the first trial of these cookies I baked it just like this but they were a little dry stuff so what I did was I added 2 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce and that really gave them a lot more moisture but it also made the dough a little bit stickier so we're going to process this again and then we're going to refrigerate it overnight so that it's firm enough that we can roll it up now that we have a nice solid cube of dough it's pretty firm but it's still a little sticky so make sure you fire your surface with some oat flour and then you're gonna roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick this takes a little while because it is cold a little harder to roll out I do between wax paper just to make it easier and to be sure that it won't stick and then you're going to cut out whatever shapes you want of course I did little gingerbread men and make sure you're careful when you pull the cookie cutter back up just be really gentle give it a little wiggle and maybe you press the dough down a little bit to get it out of the cookie cutter as it as it warms up it gets a little stickier a little softer so just be gentle I got about five or six cookies the first rule and then I got I actually took the scraps of dough and reroll them out and got two more cookies so I ended up with I think 8 cookies total something like that and now we're going to bake them for 10 to 11 minutes at 350 Fahrenheit and then just take them off the pan and let them cool completely before you decorate them of course you can just eat them as they are you don't have to be decorated but if you want to make them cute and holiday s then I used a little bit of whipped coconut cream to draw on little eyes and you can draw a mouth or whatever you want and then I also used some pomegranate arils to put little buttons on them I just think pomegranate arils look so festive but get creative and do whatever you want at this point so they're really cute and decorate Abel but the most important part is that they taste amazing they are soft and moist and sweet and had a lot of molasses and ginger spice going on I am in love with these cookies they're probably my favorite gingerbread cookie I've ever had I really hope you try these and have some fun healthy holiday baking I think they make for a pretty pretty fantastic gift as well so maybe you should just share this video with someone that you want to bake these for you like a little hint the full recipe all written out is at PC on free comm and I have another gingerbread recipe coming up soon on my blog next week probably so be sure to check for that thanks for watching bye", "BxMAuxvUOdA": "hi i'm brenda welcome to nano city apron it's cookie time okay one of the things i really like to make around this holiday season is uh molasses cookies i absolutely love the smell of them obviously the taste as well but the smell is wonderful the aromas yeah just takes you back to the good days as a child running around at grandma's house well now we're at nana's house that's me let's get started i already have everything pre-measured so it doesn't take us forever to get these done and in this bowl i am actually going to sift together all purpose flour ground ginger hold on a second let me stir this around just a wee bit first use this to get some of that down through there so it doesn't make such a mess but it's all-purpose flour ground ginger cinnamon clove nutmeg salt and some baking soda but that is what we are sifting and you just yeah you want to make sure all those spices there's no little chunks you don't want one of those kind of chunks in your cookie you know over spice wouldn't be good but that's what we're doing right here and in my stand mixer i'm going to put brown sugar oil that's just going to be an unflavored oil we don't want any flavor to that um my molasses and then i'm going to add a cookie or a cookie i'm going to add a cookie to it guys no i'm gonna add an egg to it but first of all i want to get those other uh the sugar and the oil and the molasses i want to get all of those creamed in together yep brown sugar one cup next is our oil again it's just plate it's a non-flavored oil and we have our molasses yeah buddy look at that look at that nice i'm trying to find one my little spatulas just a little bitty thin one there it is because we definitely want all that goodness this is unsalted molasses by the way it's the best when it comes to molasses cookies in my opinion [Music] [Applause] now i'm gonna add our eggs get that cream really good and up a little bit yeah i'm going to turn it off for a second give it a lift up get you guys over here i'm gonna the uh our trash pickup is going on so brinkley's live will start barking no surprise see all right now now that's creamed together what we're going to do next is wipe off this mess yeah always have a sink of water and a dish cloth or a dish rag ready um what we're going to do next is just a like a little bit at a time we're going to add our flour mixture let me get it let me get a spoon but we're going to add just a little at a time so that we don't get a mighty poof and it just mixes better so probably about half of it than the other half i'm imagining is what we're going to do you're not going to see a whole lot because i'm going to lay a towel over this now i have a an attachment that allows me to put that on here and not make a big cloudy poof but i'm just gonna do it with kale see what happens all right let's let's scoop that off of there because we do want it to mix good scoop that off of there and then go ahead and add the rest of our flour mixture our flour and our spices and all that let's get that in there what say let's say it's built a little bit it's what i say but it's all right it's just a little bit so we're good it's a minor little spiel okay yeah we'll put that back down make sure you get it all the way down be sure you lock there you go sorry be sure you lock your stand down and yeah i can do it without putting that on there so you guys can see what's happening in there get this to mix together stop it for a second it smells wonderful but i want to i want to make sure and get this mixed and good scrape all this off the bottom stand mixers are nice but you know you don't beat that hand mixer that you can just take and scrape along everything and yeah scrape along the bottoms and stuff and get everything out of it all right all right y'all see that it's looking good huh i wasn't satisfied with the consistency of this cookie dough so i went ahead and put an extra egg in there i had one but i've decided i want to use two because it's helped with the creaminess okay let's stop that oh yeah much better yeah i am a lot more pleased with that yeah all right well let's unplug this now i've got uh i've got me some sugar it's just plain sugar that we're gonna actually roll these cookies in what it does is it helps give the little crinkle effect to them all right now i've got my mixer unplugged i'm going to remove the blade from it definitely get all of the goodness off of there but we're going to take this and we are going to scoop out our cookies y'all down here so you can see what i'm doing i hope you can my my but here's my sugar cookie scoop i want them small so we're just gonna dump that in there and we're gonna roll it around in the sugar but yeah it gives it that really nice crinkly uh top so and then i'm going to [Music] i'm gonna get you can use your hand if you want to but i'm going to use just this little rim pin to smash that down i guess y'all would probably want to see me do that sorry again about the time you get used to using something things change things change there's a big hulk outside in our backyard my dogs were going crazy about it but yeah we just push it down like that now we're going to go ahead and do this with every one of our cookies [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay that that you know those are going to taste amazing i'm sure they are let me go ahead and stick them in my oven oh there we go 12 to 15 minutes yeah could be 15 to 20 depends on the oven so when these get finished i'll get them out of the oven and be right back with you okay i had a few more that i couldn't get on one cookie pan so five maybe six more here hey six more cookies that is a bonus right yeah i agree you know molasses cookies [Music] get all of that goodness out there that we possibly can i believe that's an empty bowl y'all believe that's an empty bowl i think it is and let's get as much of this off here as possible i you know what i don't have a single one of these scoops that i haven't broke and i don't know what i'm doing wrong with them but i sure can break them oh look that's just gonna be a little bitty when ain't it but that's okay we don't mind the little things now y'all know this is gonna be a little test cookie right here yes it's in the second batch but it's still gonna be a test it's still gonna be my test cookie smash these down as soon as those get finished i get them out of the oven okay let's check these cookies oh wow aren't those beautiful very nice i let these bake for

Tarryn and I'm one of\u00a0\nthe bakers at the Juniper Cafe and today I'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to walk you through how we make our famous\u00a0\nspiced ginger cookies just in time for the\u00a0\u00a0 holiday season so we're going to start off with\u00a0\nour spices at the Juniper we try and use as many\u00a0\u00a0 fresh and locally sourced ingredients as\u00a0\npossible but feel free to substitute in\u00a0\u00a0 any pre-ground spices that you may have\u00a0\non hand so we're going to toss our cloves pepper cinnamon and ginger into our spice grinder and give that a couple of pulses\u00a0\nuntil it's thoroughly combined\u00a0\u00a0 now in a separate bowl we're\u00a0\ngonna combine that with our flour our salt and baking soda I'm going to whisk that together\u00a0\nuntil it's nice and combined and set that aside now in the bowl of a stand mixer we're going\u00a0\nto cream together our butter and our sugar we're going to mix that on medium speed until\u00a0\nit starts sticking to the edge of the bowl\u00a0\u00a0 now we're going to add the eggs in one at a time so and once those are mixed in we're\u00a0\ngoing to add in the molasses and mix that on high until\u00a0\nit's nice and light and fluffy make sure you stop part way\u00a0\nthrough and give the bowl a\u00a0\u00a0 good scrape so that everything gets mixed in all right now that that's good to\u00a0\ngo scrape off the paddle attachment set that aside the bowl and it's time to\u00a0\nfold in our dry ingredients so mix this on low until it's just barely\u00a0\ncombined and be careful not to over mix it all right and now that our dough is all ready\u00a0\u00a0 we're going to separate it\u00a0\ninto three ounce portions so now that our dough's all portioned out we're\u00a0\ngoing to take the dough roll it up and press each\u00a0\u00a0 cookie with a layer of organic sugar and place\u00a0\nit back on our baking sheet a couple inches apart so alright so now our cookies\u00a0\nare all set to go into the oven\u00a0\u00a0 we're going to bake these at 350 degrees for\u00a0\n12 to 17 minutes rotating halfway through\u00a0\u00a0 when you take them out of the oven they might seem\u00a0\na little bit underdone but the cookies will form\u00a0\u00a0 up once we let them cool on the baking sheet\u00a0\nand it'll leave you with a nice chewy cookie\u00a0\u00a0 so this is what the cookies will look like\u00a0\nonce they're all cooled and out of the oven\u00a0\u00a0 if you decide to make these at home\u00a0\nlet us know how it goes on social media\u00a0\u00a0 or you could stop in and pick one up anytime\u00a0\u00a0 or you can place an order online for our cookie\u00a0\ngrams that we're bringing back this December", "p3C1g8rJtzU": "[Music] hi I'm Jenny welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna share with you my most favorite cookie recipe great for the holidays I usually start making it first day of fall it's my molasses cookies so delicious but today we're gonna make little tiny molasses cookies and I'm gonna use them for crusts on my mini cheesecakes my mini pumpkin cheesecakes let me show you how I make them first thing I did is preheat my oven to 375 and I have 3/4 of a cup of unsalted butter you can use shortening if you like I never use shortening for cookies I like butter and I have one cup of pects dark brown sugar I'm gonna get these mixing together you want to cream this until it's light and fluffy [Music] okay this looks good I am gonna put in one egg now I make this usually in a very beginning of fall that's off the smell of fall to me it was it smells so good when it big and for Christmas I usually make six times this recipe I do two triple batches in this mix [Music] and we're gonna put in a teaspoon of vanilla in before I do this breakdown [Music] all right with a little scrape down here and then we're gonna put in molasses now there are a lot of molasses cookies out there I have been making this one since I can even remember since my kids were born I love this recipe [Music] and it's easy I'm gonna put in a quarter cup of molasses now if you want to spray your cup and get your molasses out that way cool I've never I don't like the spray very much so I don't tonics use it no big deal then you get that mixed in [Music] ooh I love the smell of molasses okay my dough is looking beautiful but I guess it's not dough yet to this I'm gonna add two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour now you can use self-rising flour if you like but if you do that then you omit the baking soda and the salt that we're gonna put in here this is an eighth of a cup because I just use my fourth on molasses two teaspoons of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of ground clove a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a teaspoon of ginger that is it for this recipe I'm gonna mix this together he'd give us a little scrape down real quick sorry I bumped you there okay I just want to make sure everything is together all right we are gonna get these put on cookie sheets do you're gonna need some extra granulated sugar to roll these in means you're gonna want a little glass cup to flatten them with so I'm using the smallest scoop I have this is a tiny pampered chef scoop it's the smallest when they have this one is actually too big for my mini muffin tin crust so I have to make sure that I'm only filling it about halfway so I have a tiny little cookie here and I'm just gonna roll it around so I'm gonna need about 24 little cookies like this for my cheesecake crusts and then the rest of them I'll make normal-sized so I just kind of get it into a ball because this dough is a little bit sticky but I want it to be in a ball and pretty okay flatten that guy these are so little I'll be able to fit four across here is over you [Music] and if you don't want these to spread after you get them on here you can refrigerate the dough and then bake them off I'm gonna get the rest of these done and we'll be back okay so I've got all my little cookies on the tray here's the last step and I'm not adding any extra sugar to the top of these I rolled them in the sugar normally and I'm going to show you them of what's left in the bowl there we'll add more sugar but what I'm gonna do first is sprinkle some water so sounds funny but you need a good drop on each cookie because it keeps them moister and baking and I want a nice chewy molasses cookie that's how you make the cookies chewy all right normally a normal sized cookie bakes about ten minutes I think this is gonna take about five minutes then I get these in I'm gonna set my timer for five minutes and I'm gonna get to the other cookies so these I'm just gonna make sticky these small cookies with a small scoop are excellent to make when you want to dip them I make a pumpkin dip and I usually serve the pumpkin dip in these cookies together so this small size is excellent for a tip-in cookie sugar glass out of the way I find it easier to do a bunch like this first these are still small cookies but not as small of the other ones are if you're trying to avoid sugar shield your eyes hold in the middle here these cookies are so soft and chewy and delicious I don't make mine til they're crunchy because I like them chewy if you like a crunchy cookie you can bake them for a little bit longer and omit the water that I added on top o my house smells like Christmas and have my back door open so I now have a fly in here you can see a flying around it's nice here in Phoenix this time of year because it's starting to get chilly but it's not cold it's beautiful so I can have all the doors and windows open while baking I love it [Music] okay the water on these and then we're gonna put a little extra sugar normally I use turbinado sugar because it's pretty and sparkly but I think I'm out so I'm just gonna use just sprinkle some regular sugar on we'll just put a little bit more sugar again you can omit this if you don't want to okay I'm gonna put these in for about six minutes and these are done look how beautiful they are mm-hmm it smells so good in here I'm gonna let these cool for a few minutes before I take them off this cookie sheet our cookies are done in cooling and this is what I mean about them being so soft and chewy they're not crunchy I love these cookies they are super moist I may have already eaten a couple it's the epitome of the holidays around here all right we're gonna get started on the bonus recipe of the pumpkin cheesecake I am going to put 1/8 ounce bar of cream cheese in here if I can't open here's my cream cheese and then I have about 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of just plain granulated sugar and I am going to get those nice forgot to mention that and then I have one large room temperature egg in there get that goin [Music] okay I've got a half a cup of pumpkin puree next time so this is all part of Thanksgiving prep work this week it is Tuesday it's been a busy week already okay for the seasonings we are going to do about a teaspoon of vanilla got a half teaspoon of cinnamon I'm gonna put about an eighth of a teaspoon of ginger and then an eighth of a teaspoon of clove or you can use pumpkin pie spice if you prefer and if you do that use about a half a teaspoon [Music] I'm going to throw it about a quarter teaspoon of salt and the last thing is two tablespoons of all-purpose flour scrape real quick I just want to make sure everything's mixed in well okay so I have greased my mini muffin tin pretty well here's the thing trying to fit little cookies in those little tiny wells that's why I made them so small and if they still probably won't fit pick out the smallest ones yeah so but the thing about these cookies is they're super soft you can press them right in that is why I absolutely love this cookie recipe you don't want to add any extra butter or anything like that you got the pan greased if you can get them if you can get them small enough to fit the well perfect I always try to but I'll tell you what it's a trick [Music] should probably be easy if I was on the counter but my counters a mess lots going on this week with Thanksgiving prep my camera is dying so real quick I'm going to show you in my husband's coming home so it's gonna get louder we're just gonna fill these little wells with the Cheesecake mixture and then it'll bake in with the molasses cookie and it is so delicious then I'll put these in the oven and bake them at 350 for 18 to 20 minutes our little mini cheesecakes are out of the oven and cooling and they took about 18 minutes so I'm gonna let these cool in here I'm gonna wait until they're hard to I'm gonna stick them in the refrigerator let them cool in there before I use a paring knife and loosen them up and take them out and then I'll put them on a a nice tray for Thanksgiving it is such a busy day around here I thought I was gonna stop there with recipes but I'm just gonna show you my easter cracker recipe so I've got two packages of oyster crackers on here and this is my favorite thing Oh we look forward to this two favorite appetizer next two Chex party mix I'm gonna put a half a cup of corn oil in here but you can use any oil I just wouldn't use a really strong oil and then you need two packages of wrap ranch like an envelope of ranch mix or you can use your own I have my own right here I can't lift my thing I make my own ranch mix and keep it in the fridge of water milk ranch mix so I've got a quarter cup of that in there and I'm going to put an extra teaspoon of garlic powder and an extra teaspoon of dill after you get it mixed up you can taste it see if you need to add more ranch I like them really ranch and garlicky and you think it's a lot of oil but it's soaked right in to the cracker [Music] you just want to stir them up really well if you don't like it as Ranchi you can just use one envelope of ranch mix never use one envelope air bag anyway this is two bags but I need to make sure it's not enough garlic and ranch mmm that is still there Bobby with a little bit more ranch powder in and I'm gonna put smidge more garlic in garlic and that will be perfect and my homemade ranch mix that I keep in the fridge is made with buttermilk powder I know everybody has their own recipe for their ranch mix but they like okay I'm just gonna let these dry for a few and then I'm gonna stick him in a bag I've got pumpkin bread in the oven right now Oh Thanksgiving is a lot of work this is Tuesday so I did make homemade croutons I made stuffing bread Heather over at Nene homesteader put her video up with her recipe for stuffing bread so I did make that bread and make croutons on Sunday or I made the bread on Sunday maybe croutons yesterday so those are all done I made a cornbread on Sunday and I crumbled that up and dried it out also for cornbread dressing I'm about to get started on chicks party mix homemade first is buying it in a bag in a store for if you bind it back in a store it's good but it's just missing something into that old-fashioned flavor with the wish this year the saltiness I put extra garlic in you know I love garlic so I prefer to make it homemade so good so for Thanksgiving are the pre the pre-dinner kind of thing that everybody will eat all day is going to be Chex party mix oyster crackers I'll probably put the little pumpkin cheesecake sout the pumpkin bread out I have a whole array of charcuterie cheeses and meats put out I have some nuts I've got some marcona almonds and I've got some smoked almonds and I'm gonna make some spiced pecans I've got goat cheese cranberry goat cheese I always serve plain goat cheese with my homemade thick Jam so I will get that out also I've got onion jam I'll probably put that on the charcuterie board that I make pickles all those different stuffed olives I'll put those out trying to think what else I have a lot of stuff that's just the pregame okay Thanksgiving dinner of course is the turkey stuffing gravy mashed potatoes a broccoli rice casserole with cheese green bean casserole but I use fresh green beans and fresh mushrooms and fresh red bell pepper I make my own white sauce I put parmesan in it and they use bread crumbs on top and I'm going to do roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and I'm going to make a Chipotle cream sauce to go over the top of that and I don't even what

lot and I really appreciate your support thanks for watching I'll see you next time Happy Thanksgiving [Music] yeah", "SE4PrJ3rd8Y": "[Music] hello I'm Ashley and welcome to the plentiful picnic channel a channel where I show delicious and fun plant-based eating and tips for more eco-friendly lifestyle and today's video I'm going to be showing you how to make these and gingerbread people this recipe for gingerbread people only requires simple whole food ingredients and is it delicious I tried a water recipe is for a gingerbread man but they're usually too dry so I made up my own recipe that only has whole food ingredients and and is a perfect amount of moist and its softness but before we get started go ahead and hit that subscribe button down below because I know you're going to love these to make this recipe you'll first need some a tablespoon of ground flax seed meal and put that in a small bowl and then mix that in with 2 tablespoons of water and then set that aside next to a large bowl add some almond butter I'm using a mixture of nut butters and it has things in it and that works as well pour in Simon maple syrup and then you'll need some molasses you want the dark thick kind just like this and then up next I'm going to add 1/4 cup of banana you want the video to be very ripe but just like this I'm gonna measure 1/4 cup of banana that's 1/4 cup of banana then you need to mash the banana you can mash it in a separate Bowl but I like to mash it in the same Bowl and then add a new spices some cinnamon ground nutmeg some sea salt some vanilla extract and a pinch of ground cloves and then once your flaxseed meal has been sitting for about 10 minutes you could also add that into the mix and then whisk everything together and then finally we need to add in the flour I usually use all-purpose flour but Eirene I thought so I'm using some whole-wheat flour that is sifted so it's more fun and then finally add in some baking soda and then mix all that together that is very good and then once your dough is completely mixed it will be very thick and stiff and then cover the ball and put the dough in the fridge for a little bit I'm gonna try to be a half an hour or an hour just so the dough could sit so it's easier to roll it out it's been over an hour now and I'm going to it take out the dough from the fridge and now comes the most fun part rolling the dough and making a good news so first be 2 or raw dough so I'm going to do it take some flour and just sprinkle it on on your flowering surface just like that and then you want to scoop out all of your dough onto your floured surface oh yeah and then I almost tried to form it into a ball first and then I could cover it with just a little bit of flour and then start rolling it up you might need to put more flour down if it starts to stick to your surface and then keep rolling out the dough until it's about a quarter of an inch thick you said gingerbread man shaped cookie cutter to cut the dough into a gingerbread man shapes and then next remove the dough between the gingerbread people transfer the gingerbread people to a pan and cook in the oven at 350 degrees for about 11 to at 13 minutes depending how thick you make yours form the remaining dough into a ball and spread out and roll out again to repeat the process I finished baking all the cookies I always have one little clock cooking it at the end zone there's not enough to make another it's just a quiet person and now comes the next fun part bringing these little guys to life I'm using some white frosting I made a while ago and just froze it it's coconut and has some sugar but you can use any other type of frosting as long as it's not too thin and then I'm using this plastic bag I got for my family because these plastic bags no just wash it and then put on a piping tip [Music] this the Beast you're not really good and I think they're a bit better if I use all-purpose flour instead of local wheat flour and these cookies have allspice and not super sweet so they're a great breakfast cooking well these are all my finished cookies well I had a lot of fun making these a gingerbread cookie sitive we should try this healthier at recipe for gingerbread cookies if you love a lot of flavor and not super sweet all these the recipe in the description box below if you want to see more videos like this definitely hit that subscribe button down below well that's all I have for today stay happy you don't be this guy [Music]", "XslECQtFef8": "hey everyone its Amy and in today's video we'll be making these super cute gingerbread men cookies so you're going to start off by beating half a cup of unsalted butter you want to beat this until it is smooth and creamy it should look something like this and now you're going to add half a cup of brown sugar and just beat that in until it is well combined now you're going to crack in one egg along with half a cup of molasses make sure to grease your measuring bowl so that it is not all second there like mine was now you're just going to beat that in until it is well combined soon enough it should look something like this now you're going to add your spices which is one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of ginger 1/4 teaspoon of cloves inter going to add half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt next we're going to add two and a half cups of all-purpose flour so first I use my mixer to mix this in you and it turned out to be something like this so I decided to stop using my mixer and I just put some flour on my hands and just kind of massaged the dough into one ball now I just place the dough onto a piece of parchment paper and then you're just going to flatten it into a disk shape but first I added some more flour so it wouldn't stick to my hands now I'm just going to cover it up with a parchment paper and you're just going to place it in the fridge for about two hours by place to mind their overnight so this is the next morning and here is the dough it's nice and firm and ready to go so I'm just dusting my workspace with some flour now we're going to roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch thick soon enough it should look something like this and now you're going to use your cookie cutters to cut out the shapes I'm using a gingerbread man cookie cutter a star cookie cutter a Christmas tree cookie cutter and a candy cane cutter a mitten cutter and just a bunch of different Christmas themed cookie cutters you so now I took the left over dough and I just flattened it into a disc again and wrapped it back up in the parchment paper you can place this dough in the fridge for about another two to three days or you can freeze it in your freezer for a couple of weeks and then you can use it again to make more cookies so now you want to bake the gingerbread cookies at 350 Fahrenheit or 180 Celsius for about eight to ten minutes sena are going to make the frosting so this is really simple i have 1 cup of powdered sugar I added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of milk you can add more or less milk depending on the consistency that you want so now I'm just using a whisk to just mix this all together and I am transferring the finish glaze into a piping bag now you can just do whatever designs you want on your cold cookies here I'm just doing a really simple gingerbread man design and for candy canes I'm just doing little stripes you can also add food coloring to your icing if you want to do that you so here are the finished gingerbread cookies thank you so much for watching this video I hope you guys can try it out and have a happy holidays see you next time bye you", "llFkQuqFLZ8": "can you make a vegan gluten-free molasses cookie that's every bit as good as the regular version let's find out for the vegan gluten-free molasses cookie you'll need one and a half cups of gluten-free baking flour and 3 4 cups of almond flour you'll need 3 4 cups of brown sugar 1 and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon of ground ginger and a quarter teaspoon of ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon baking powder half teaspoon baking soda half teaspoon salt 6 tablespoons avocado oil quarter cup of molasses quarter cup of warm water 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and then a quarter cup of cane sugar in a medium bowl i'm adding my gluten-free flour my almond flour the cinnamon the brown sugar ground ginger nutmeg baking powder baking soda and salt i'm stirring my dry ingredients together before i add the wet ingredients i'm telling you this is the easiest recipe to put together [Music] now i'm adding my avocado oil the recipe called for grape seed oil but i use avocado oil for literally everything i'll have the original recipe linked in my description box below now i'm adding molasses and i like to spray my cup with oil before i put in the molasses that way it doesn't all stick to the cup [Music] i also did add my one quarter cup of warm water which is not shown here and then i added my vanilla i'm going to use my hand mixer but first i like to move things around and get it incorporated a little bit because my mixer tends to spray the flour everywhere you'll just blend it until all the ingredients are well incorporated [Music] now i'm putting my cane sugar in a bowl because i'm going to be rolling the dough and rolling it in the sugar and i'm putting parchment paper down on my cookie sheet if you have a cookie scoop you'll want to use that i do not have a cookie scoop so i'm kind of making a bit of a round circle using two spoons and then i'm going to drop it into the sugar and coat it with the sugar by either rolling it around or sprinkling it on top [Music] then i'll just put it down on the parchment paper and squish it down a little bit so that it's a little more flat i'll just keep going until my cookie sheet is full [Music] my oven is preheated to 350 degrees and i'm setting the timer to 10 to 12 minutes so i usually go right in the middle at 11 minutes but it definitely took the full 12. by the magic of video there are those beautiful vegan gluten-free cookies if you've ever been saddened by the texture of a gluten-free cookie you definitely need to try this recipe this recipe was just beautiful now my daughter yvonne is going to make the regular counterpart she's using four and a half cups of flour four teaspoons of ground ginger two teaspoons of baking soda one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon one teaspoon of ground cloves a quarter teaspoon of salt to that she'll add one and a half cups of shortening two cups of granulated sugar two eggs a half cup of molasses then she'll roll the dough in coarse or granulated sugar her flour is in the bowl and to that she's adding her ginger baking soda cinnamon cloves and salt think all those spices together is so pretty in a separate large bowl she's going to add the shortening which she had a little bit of trouble getting out you'll see at the end some of our behind the scenes video she's blending that until it's all creamy you'll see that it's yellow because we were actually short on shortening so we had to add butter to it to that she's adding sugar and getting that incorporated with the blender we added a little bit at a time so that it was easier to get it blended in this is where she realized that the blender was spraying it on the countertop now she's going to add in two eggs i'm spraying the cup again to get it ready for the molasses and in goes the molasses now yvonne will get all that blended together yvonne loves to bake as you can probably tell and she does have a baking instagram account called ivanio's sweets and treats and i will have that linked in the description box below if you'd like to see what else she loves to bake she's giving a quick stir to her dry ingredients so that she can add it little by little to what she's already blended and she'll blend it in as she goes [Music] [Music] and now it's all blended in and ready to go down goes her parchment paper and just like my cookie she's putting the sugar in the bowl the granulated sugar so that she can roll her cookies in it before she bakes them this recipe which i'll also have in my description box below called for a quarter cup of dough for each cookie so these giant cookies i think gave her an unfair advantage when it comes to seeing which cookies better her or mine so this very first cookie sheet i have her doing the giant ones like it says and then her second cookie sheet they'll be a little bit smaller so that we can have a fair contest and find out which is better the regular ones or the vegan gluten-free ones once she gets all of her cookies on the cookie sheet she'll press them down just a little bit before they go in the oven but i have to say you want to have less cookies on your cookie sheet because they kind of baked all together and we had to break them apart afterwards so if you want that nice roundness you want to put about half of those cookies on there and she's going to take them out of the oven like magic and they are i have to admit big and beautiful look at that you can see how much smaller and better spaced out that second batch is so we're getting that in the oven and then i have a little trick on getting the cookies onto the cooling rack because usually you have to wait for them to cool down a little bit but i don't want them to continue cooking so i'm pulling them parchment paper and all onto the cooling rack and that way they don't break and you can get them cooling on a cold rack right away and there is our i'm done with the cookies dance which cookie recipe do you think is going to be better here's my vegan gluten-free cookies and as a reminder here's yvonne's regular recipe let's see how they taste even after instant replay we could not come to a decision so you're just gonna have to make the cookies and let us know which one you think is better meanwhile here's a little behind the scenes it's embarrassing do you know get mad at it yeah off to the side would probably be good you were like push no push this hold this push that put your hand on the top push we're gonna have to clean the floor okay thanks so much for watching remember as always god loves you and i love you and i can't wait to see you next time you", "y_Pp6Sfr2og":

preheating your oven to 160 degrees Celsius in a pot add in some butter golden syrup Muscovado sugar and caster sugar put the pot on a medium heat and then just leave it until the butter starts to melt when your butter starts to melt mix it gently just keep on mixing it gently until there are a few lumps of butter left in remove from the heat and then carry on mixing until all your butter is melted and then put this mixture to one side and then get a bowl with flour ground ginger mix spice and then add in a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda whisk this together with a hand whisk and then get your butter mixture and pour it into your flour mixture just pour it all in and then just stir a few times and then add in one egg and then mix this gently until the butter and the flour are mixed in to make a dough like this and then you can add in your stem ginger at this point or I'm going to use crystallized ginger just gonna add it to my butter mix if there are big chunks of this crystallized ginger just break off the pieces and then put them in the bowl and then mix it all together put your wooden spoon to one side and then get pieces of dough with your hand about this size and then you're going to make them into a bowl by gently rolling the dough in your hands and - it forms a bowl like this and then you're going to put this on your baking tray and then just carry on getting a bit of the dough or roll it into a ball again between your hands and put them on a baking tray baked them in the oven for about 14 to 16 minutes and then removed them and leave them on the cooling rack they slightly puff up when they're baked so you could just push them down with a fork but this is not necessary and then leave them on the baking tray for about five minutes and then use a spatula to gently remove them from the baking tray as you can see and then it is nicely cooked and golden-brown and the top is nicely baked then gently removed them all and put them on a cooling rack and leave them to cool completely I'm going to show you the inside of this cookie it's nice and baked through and this chewy and they taste great and smell great because of the ginger and the mixed spice and that's it thanks for watching and see you again soon for more videos like this visit my website", "cU9ne7peHe8": "foreign foreign [Laughter] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign

welcome everybody to the wellness soldier cooking with cannabis series my name is Cody Lindsay and today we're gonna be making Organa Graham's gingerbread cookies made with cannabis cookie leaf cutouts let's get started what we're gonna do is we're gonna incorporate all the wet ingredients we're gonna start with our butter and incorporate that with our 3/4 cup brown sugar those guys become friends for a little bit alright now there's a nice Brown sugary paste we're gonna add the eggs and mix we're gonna add a little vanilla every now and then turn it off the Machine and making sure that you scrape everything together nothing worse than thinking you're done you go to scrape the dough out there's a big ball of sugar and dough at the bottom and now how to incorporate organa grams cannabis oil or critical push widths into the gingerbread cookies one you can make a butter with the critical Cushman's blend or you can use a cannabis oil so we want approximately 10 milligrams of cannabis oil per cookies makes 36 cookies per recipe batch then that's approximately 15 milliliters of cannabis of cannabis oil so rather than doing 15 1 2 3 4 just gonna put that down I'm just gonna grab our 15 milliliter sure to get it all in there it's expensive it's your medication you want to make sure that it's all off the spoon and just incorporate so it's nice and liquidy we have our three cups flour our baking soda or baking powder and just dump it in and in here we have the gingerbread II goodness we've got the cinnamon the cloves and the ginger just dump that in because there's a lot of flour in there it's not quite mixed yet start low remembering to scrape down the sides as you go so now that that's all mixed up we're gonna pull it down we're gonna get our floured surface ready take it up the other we got it down on our floured surface we're gonna cut it into two pieces just to make it easier to work with just cut it in half the thing about gingerbread cookies unlike most cookies is that they're not gonna puff up really so the size that you roll them out to is the size that they're gonna be in the end then you take your cookie cutter a choice ours is the cannabis leaf and cut out your cookie dough and at this point let me just take it roll it again so now that we got our cookies ready to go in the oven at this point you can hit them with a little sugar on top to have a nice sugar glaze or you can wait until they come out and hit them with a nice icing sugar and water glaze and it's just nice or you can hit them with some more light so you can decorate them

gonna try some viral um baking videos and then we're gonna do so i thought we'd start with a classic a ginger molasses cookie um yeah so let's watch how to make it because that's important and then then we'll make it just try and hold me back okay let's watch the video [Music] are you excited do you like ginger molasses cookies i don't know what that is okay so it's basically a cookie but i love i get these at starbucks no we can't do it it says you have to have a whisk okay have you ever had molasses before no i'll get them to try it you could say this recipe puts the ass in molasses no i think it'll be good we don't have a mixer okay well i asked for that for christmas so i have a spoon he'll do all right everything you got me making today is just rolling stuff into balls well i think

refrigerator it was super easy um so i'm gonna have drew help me do the balls and i thought since i can help you with the balls all right and i think since he didn't help he should have to have like a spoonful of molasses that'll make me vomit into the pot have you ever tried it no i don't want it try a little no i don't really i don't want it just really a little actually molasses by itself but it is not good that's why drew has to have a little bit why would you say that right before i have to eat it here comes the airplane oh my god you're gonna kill me i'm too excited to have cookie's bait of this but trust me it's with the um ginger that's what makes it baby okay so next step we're going to roll even the wine tastes like molasses now why would anyone eat that ever how is that

accessories i just thought of the molasses so you're gonna take the dough that i made yeah roll it into one inch balls and then roll it into the sugar according to the recipe in america first you get the sugar then you get the power then you get the whammon and apparently the balls too okay is that an inch was it okay look at yours compared to mine mine looks like a potato look at it okay first of all you want a round and i don't know like would that be considered an inch like an inch is what like a but um timbit i guess we can try different sizes okay so oh my gosh yeah okay cuz i already put it down so yeah roll it with your hands and then put in the sugar like a real life baker all right you're good at it can you build the snowman i have to go balls of them all balls we've got balls it's

"RZsz6uMRlyo": "hello again and welcome back to my kitchen today we're going to be making molasses one of my favorites from when I was a child and I hope you like [Music] I [Music] that's it TV delicious and miss version is even locale thanks for watching be sure to leave a comment and tell me what other SP was I see [Music] you [Music]", "k09zApf8GZs": "okay everyone so we're gonna start by reading your recipe so everyone should have a copy of the ginger molasses cookies recipe and we're gonna go through and we're just gonna follow it step by step and i hope everyone's doing well it's been a quite a while so first we're going to measure out and whisk our flour baking soda ginger cinnamon cloves nutmeg and salt together until combined and we're going to set that aside so we're going to start with two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour have that over here i'm just going to measure as i go i know there's proper 4-h measuring techniques we want it nice and flat i'm going to really not do this perfect but supposed to use a straight edge and flatten it out so it looks nice and level like that and then we just pour it in so that is one cup and we're gonna add two cups here normally you'd use a butter knife i was not fair enough to get a better knife so i'm using the edge of my measuring cup and there's my quarter cup there we go it's two and a quarter cups of that i'm gonna go one and one half teaspoon of baking soda find that on this lovely thing as a reminder we always want to make sure we wash our hands before we do any baking obviously now more than ever that's extremely important and you know it is cold out and gross and you never know what you've touched so you always want to do that let me find my half teaspoon we tie our hair back when we're baking as well there's nothing worse than finding a lovely beautiful hair in our food no one enjoys that and now we're on to two teaspoons of ground ginger so with that um i like my ginger cookies to have a little bit more of a bite which means they're a little bit almost spicier not in like the spicy like it's a hot pepper spicy but it's just oh my goodness you can't get this open so i tend to put a little bit extra in you do not have to do that you can put a little less if you don't like that super strong flavor and i'm not measuring the right one good for me okay so also make sure you are paying attention to what you're measuring just like this that's the salt and the sugar and a teaspoon to a tablespoon make sure you're grabbing the correct one because there's my ginger as you can see there's my nutmeg they look kind of similar so let's try this again ginger never measure over your bowl like i'm doing this is very bad because when it overflows like i'm doing it you don't get a proper measurement and if it's something important like flour it's not good all right we're gonna pretend i did that properly so we're gonna go one and a quarter teaspoons of cinnamon get my little cinnamon bag out here and some people like to use cinnamon sugar it's really not that much all that does it just adds a little bit more sweetness and get a little bit less of the cinnamon flavor in it so most of the time you want to stick by following the recipe you can see i did not and now we're on to cloves close is only a quarter teaspoon um i take my little shaker thing off for everyone to see and i go in shake it out i sometimes like a little bit of the extra spices but that's just me if we're doing this properly for 4-h we're not going to do that and then we have that was cloves and now we're on to nutmeg now i can measure it out properly and nutmeg is only a quarter teaspoon i'm gonna shove this little guy in there level them out and shake them on and salt so i'll forgive my little sheep i can get them out um there we go that should be good so let me just put that in i don't measure the salt i've got enough baking my time and i don't measure anymore with the salt and stuff but definitely please measure because if you end up with a super huge amount it's never yummy so now that i have all that in i'm going to get my little whiskey you can use a fork i use a whisk and you just mix it together until you get this kind of like beige look just make sure you get to the bottom because there's just clumps of flour in there clean the edge of your bowl and just like that we're done okay and i put it in the wrong bowl clearly guys i have not done this via video before so i just put it in a smaller bowl didn't spill any you can kind of see it on the side i'm going to reuse my bowl because you know waste not want huh a tip is always to keep your sink full of dishwater so that as you're baking you can do your dishes and that way then at the end you don't have a mountain of dishes and it doesn't seem so intimidating to do your baking so always a nice tip you will learn that when you do face to face baking that i really enjoy making sure dishes are done because when you sit down at the end of your baking to enjoy your stuff you don't have to get back up and do dishes so we're on to step number two in a large bowl use a handheld mixer so i got that right here um beat the butter and both sugars together at high speed until creamy and combine about two minutes so then that's kind of depending on your stuff and then once it's combined we're gonna add the molasses and beat until combined add the egg and vanilla and still you're gonna beat it until combined and scrape down the sides of the bowl so perfect what we're going to do is i'm going to get my butter i've already pre-measured my butter because it was frozen so i threw it in the microwave for 20 seconds to soften it up and there we go it's my butter just use a spatula to scrape the size of the bowl because when you measure something obviously that includes all the little stuff you've left on the side and for certain recipes depending on what you're making that little bit can make a big difference in how your cookies or your baking turns out so then we need and that was three quarters of a cup of butter we're going to get half a cup of lightly packed brown sugar so there because brown sugar you might see that it'll be unpacked lightly packed and packed and that just means because because it's so fluffy it um you can actually get more in there so it's not like flour that like once it's full it's full i guess you could really pack flour if you wanted to but it's kind of like sand rather than rocks you can only get so many rocks and you can't squish them down they're pretty hard but with sand you can kind of squish in a little more or feathers you can squish in more so i'm just going to plop that in that's half a cup and then we're going to go into white sugar [Music] i like to think well someone told me this and i like to believe it that brown sugar is healthier than white sugar because it's like brown flour versus white flour and i like to believe that so i like brown sugar on more things it's a little bit sweeter it already has molasses in it that's what gives it the brown color there's my half cup white sugar or quarter cup my apologies in there and we're gonna mix that up so excuse the noise we're just gonna buzz this around for a minute or so [Music] [Music] uh okay so basically what you want to do is just make sure that all the little powdered sugar on the bottom is gone and that you don't see any big clumps of butter stuck in the brown sugar mixture i i don't know if you noticed i click the beaters on the edge of the bowl don't do it too hard but what that does is that cleans out your beaters and then you don't lose any other cookie dough next we're going to add in the molasses so where is my quarter cup i set it here molasses so i don't know if you guys have ever heard of the saying slower the masses in january glasses is nice and thick it has a very distinct scent to it and it's nice and dark and there you go so you can see it's warm right now it's nice and runny and it comes out just like black goo i love it i used to as a kid eat it with cheese so my little measuring cup is too small for my spatula so i will be right back with a smaller spatula look at that and i also make sure to keep your recipe away from your baking area i have a bad habit of ending up with a recipe covered in what i've made adds character but sometimes it's not great when you go to pull it out the next time and it is crunchy there we go so you clean about same thing as the butter because you have measured exactly what you need that does include the stuff on the side so there we go so there's my quarter cup i'm gonna put my dishes off to the side and wipe my hand on the tea towel or my apron and we go one large egg my little egg has a crack in it obviously living on a farm we don't get the good ones we get the rejects so there's my egg and i'm gonna add my vanilla always make sure to read your instructions as to what order you add things in because at some points that really really does make a difference depending on what it is and when you add it it can change the consistency and the texture of what you're baking and it can actually ruin your recipe if you add something too soon or too late obviously cookie is not so bad but if you're baking certain cakes or certain um pies it can make a really big difference so boom there we go look at that so i'm just going to heat that back up so okay so as you can see it's kind of a nice brown mess i'm going to add my dry goods to my wet goods there is certain recipes um that it makes a big difference whether you add wet to dry or dry to wet i personally always if it doesn't specify i always try to add my wet in or my dry into my wet because it is always easier to shake at the dry contents than it is to try to spatula out while holding the bowl the wet contents and don't add everything at once because it will [Music] cut so add your ingredients a little by little because if you do not you're going to get a big puff of flour and cinnamon and everything in the air because obviously you're putting an electric mixer into powder so now the mixers you don't need them on high speed or anything like that because it can burn up your so we're just going to mix this last little bit up and then we're going to chill it okay guys so now that that's all mixed up what we're going to do is we're going to cover and chill it so let's chill it for an hour i'm just going to pop it outside or in the freezer you can chill it a little bit quicker by doing that and normally normally what you do when you are baking is as you start your recipe you start to warm up your oven and it normally says at the start of the recipe or somewhere in the body of it how to or what temperature to warm to and then that way by the time you're done baking everything's on a cookie sheet and ready to go your oven's up to temperature and you're not standing around for 10 or 15 minutes waiting on that so you got to think ahead sometimes and plan out and then that way when everything is ready to go you don't have to stand and wait perfect so i'm just going to set this outside for a little and uh we'll come back and we will be ready then okay guys so i have done all my dishes and cleaned up my area i've reset my stuff for my next step so i've lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper got my bowl of sugar to roll with um it's only been about 15-ish minutes so definitely should cool it longer the main reason why we cool stuff i'm just gonna take my ring off here the main reason why we cool stuff is so that when you go to roll them you don't get a bunch of sticky stuff on your fingers they're a little bit stiffer to roll so when you roll them you're pretty good your hands are nice and clean but as you get further into it and the dough gets warmer it's going to be a little bit stickier and you're going to get like this gunk on your hands basically i just put it in the sugar roll around and pop it on my tray you can see this corner this corner can't see any of it we'll get there so make sure to make when you're rolling your cookies you make sure to make them a consistent size not only so no one fights over who gets the bigger cookies but also so that we do not get uneven baking if you have a really really small one and a really really big one obviously they're not going to bake the same which we do not want because then you're gonna get some that are nice and doughy and soft some that are undercooked and some that are overcooked and i know everyone has their own personal preference as to how they like their cookies but i personally do not like going from a really yummy cookie because i always have more than one two getting one that's slightly burnt and crunchy so i'm just gonna keep rolling away here and we will get the tray filled and then move on to another one if we have to okay so as you can see i am done rolling i have my two trays set up you always want to make sure you can grab a second tray if you need to because it's better to have a proper spacing you might get as your cookies as they expand in the oven to almost into each other so i have two trays i have a little bit of extra on one but that is okay i'm just going to pop them in the oven for 10 or 15 minutes my oven has been preheated to 350. so we will see how they go and let's hope for the best i'm hoping it works out okay guys so they have come out of the oven as you can see they have the nice cracking on them if they do not what you can do let me just grab them a minute is you kind of slam the tray and that way they get a little bit more cracking and you can just put them back in it would just go like this and it does if they're not cracked because of the way that they're just slightly doughy on the top they would do that split to give the traditional ginger molasses look to them so i hope you guys have enjoyed the video and i am looking forward to seeing what you guys have made and are planning on sharing with us thanks guys and i hope to see y'all soon", "QH2eGefShxc": "[Music] Hey welcome back to the cop kitchen I'm Dave Chevy so today I'm gonna make another batch of cookies it's gonna be a cookie that I remember growing up as a kid my dad really liked him so uh my mom made him a lot and that is molasses cookies now I would have no idea

eating jitterbug sandwich apple pie chicken pot pie a bunch of different recipes and I'm gonna get to most of them before the time is over and this one again one of my favorites it's got a lot of spices in it and let's see how we do here we go there we go again I want to thank my sister too arena putting that cookbook together one of the other recipes in there hungie guns you can hit up the

cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg I love this fella not me and 1/4 teaspoon of salt also the wet ingredients will include 1/2 a cup of shortening 1/2 cup of sugar granulated sugar plus 3 tablespoons and when we get to that that 3 tablespoons will be used to rule the cookie dough in before we put them in the oven the 2/3 cups of unsalted molasses okay I don't know what sulfur molasses is so unsalted I'm using this Crosby it's called it's fancy molasses 100 percent pure and it says right under it unhhhh sulfur okay there you go along with that you're gonna need 1/4 cup of water and 1 egg let's get started okay I've got my two and a half cups of flour and a medium-sized bowl I did not sift the flour I don't think you need

in oh that smells good hmm nutmeg comes ooh big time let's whisk this up you know it is risky business set that aside wet ingredients so the wet ingredients in large bowl we're gonna put our shortening then we're gonna do we'll put the sugar mix I'm gonna use a hand mixer you can use you can do it all by hand or use a stand mixer if you want let's put all that sugar and mix it all up we'll add our molasses [Music] you've met a Little Mix in goes the water cake and something that's not in the recipe that I like to add is a teaspoon of vanilla and give that a mix until well combined okay now we're gonna add our flour a little at a time and then stir it in I add about half of it I'm getting started so we'll be putting this in the refrigerator once we get it all mixed for about two hours then we'll take it out will form the dough into about two inch maybe a tablespoon balls roll them in the sugar and then we'll cook them in a preheated oven that set it 350 degrees [Music] when you put it in the refrigerator go ahead and put some wrap over it plastic wrap and cover it [Music] all righty I'm gonna cover this and put it the refrigerator for a couple hours I'll be back so that two hours went by pretty quick didn't it at least for you guys all right so the matter is under the refrigerator it's firmed up a little bit I've taken a cookie sheet I have lined it with my as you know when I do my cookies like these ones I like this silicone liner or the cookie if not you can just put the cookies on a ungreased cookie sheet so we're just gonna scoop out yeah this is my one tablespoon scoop also I've got a two tablespoon scoop I made make it for a bigger cookie but I'm gonna roll them into a ball roll them into sugar put them on the pan up two inches apart beauty of this one that matches it for you all right I'll speed this up a little bit so you'll have to wait so long [Music] all right two pans ready to go in the oven 350 degrees 810 minutes first batch out of the oven we're gonna let them sit on the baking pan the cookie sheet for a few minutes and then we'll transfer them over to the infamous cooling rack they're cool enough now we're going to move them over to the cooling rack and let them cool completely [Music] so they are stacks and stacks of molasses cookies you know it smells like smells like the shippi household mom was making these this is another

going to show you how to make chewy gingerbread cookies so let's get started first preheat the oven to 350 degrees then in a large bowl add in the softened butter and brown sugar [Music] and cream them with an electric mixer for one to five minutes the longer you cream it the more the cookies will spread in the oven so if you don't want them to spread much don't cream it for very long [Music] then add in the egg and molasses mix them in until they're combined and scrape down the sides if needed [Music] then in a separate small bowl add in the flour [Music] baking soda salt ginger cinnamon nutmeg [Music] cloves and allspice and whisk them together until they're combined [Music] add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix them in until they're combined then scoop out some of the dough roll it into a ball roll it around in some sugar and place it onto a sheet pan lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper spacing them out at least one and a half inches apart if you feel like the dough is too soft to work with you can place the dough into the fridge to let it firm up and it will be easier to work with and chilling the dough makes no difference to how they will bake then bake them in the oven for about 10 minutes until they're nicely browned when they're done remove it from the oven and let them cool in the pan for at least two minutes and transfer them to a cooling rack and let them cool for longer and you can serve them still warm or cooled completely and that's how to make chewy gingerbread cookies i hope you enjoyed this video and i have so many more

teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon of baking soda half a teaspoon of grass clothes but we're going to be skipping that because we don't have any friends close if you do I make sure to add that in half teaspoon of fine yourself oh we forgot that my grandma's just going to get back and 16 flashes of unsalted butter at room temperature 1 cup of sugar a lot more for rolling and the kind of sugar doesn't really matter a third of a cup of molasses and one lower deck which is rich let's take our time and take our to 14 cups as well two and a quarter body and if you if you have a strong flour bag or container flour or something smash just um dump it in and pour it into the top first and it's not too over baby ingredient and let you have a bit too much new pieces hello what up ship soon shin onion and could work [Music] the of ground ginger not soon if if you're grounded is since I'm user half teaspoon but you will need door half teaspoons of your container is too big now one teaspoon of ground cumin not I see penny too soon but if you are not as easy to do but just a little bit extra just in case you out an extra ginger you might want to add extra cinnamon well now we're going to get to the half a teaspoon of fine salt and we're just going to have to eyeball this since ours is a grinder probably if it isn't my sister now we're going to be together bands i am not too fast here we go nixon as you see natalie has to me not Natalie one in the video but it's titled kitty been with Stan and Natalie what are the gaming channel it's not just gaining you see a bit more ok now we're going to start with the winning game if you don't have a mixer to beat the butter and sugar together it just do it with us a wooden spoon the old-fashioned way we're just going to drop in there it should not handle another small it was one step one stick for answers on it now one cup of sugar request more for rolling so let's beat your butter up first so it'll combined discover well so natalie is going to doing that try and clean the butter that is important to step to get the best from the wall of the bowl so add to get horn on board your sugar is your it used a half top if you can any type of sugar will work but pretty how you can see here but but you don't have to put this in the fridge so it'll be softer now what's coming together or beat them if you have a electric mixer yeah I'll be delicious already besides if you need to I usually do that all the time okay so now we're flying on molasses interrupting I make sure to do it over your bowl and uh quickly quickly use a knife to do it to scrape it out now not only is going to pour it in okay okay and kick it soon now you are going to add the egg in make sure it's one egg one mortgage now you're going to mix mix mint so you might need an alternative but you can take tums with a Worcester siblings if you can to get the door already but you have to eat it in tell layer and cult so not so dark like the molasses so we're going to show you a close-up of the finish make sure this is what it should look like so after that it should just look like this lighter of a total than the molasses though do a little bit extra mixing and then you're ready to add the dry mix trip try a try foot please spoon fulls in Mick three spoonfuls or piece like that 22 and hurry Oh unanimity you're not even how to help with this purpose well through the next to the losses and buy a used together now I'm going to add my encouraging 12 sorry see your close-up you all might hurt some mixers or your hand this is what the dough should look like okay so now we are doing the rolling the ball and sugar normal and the volume sugar then get your body in sugar then strain it around the ball now top it on the shrink so now our cookies are rolled out on the tray as you can see so now we have to heat up into of 375 and bake for 12 to 15 minutes here's the finished product YUM [Music]", "YFI4DiU2SmY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "a0w1FwEhUaI": "good morning facebook friends and family today we are doing the ginger molasses cookies and peanut butter sandwich cookies so um we're gonna go ahead and get started okay guys so i have my oven set at 350 already and ready to go we're going to start with the um ginger cookies today and we're going to go ahead and start mixing the ingredients so flour is two and a quarter cups of flour all right and then baking soda is uh two teaspoons of baking soda so this is gonna be a two-parter because the molasses cookies they have to sit in the fridge but while those are sitting i'm gonna go ahead and start the um the peanut butter cookies and then uh ginger you can use as much as you want um i use about a half a tablespoon maybe three quarters of a tablespoon and if you don't have the ginger or cinnamon or clove you can use an allspice too that works and then i'm gonna add a little bit of cinnamon which i that's what i'm using today is cinnamon and allspice because i don't have the clove and the ginger even though they're ginger cookies i know but i find that the allspice works just as well okay and i'm not adding salt to this because i'm using salted butter so and this is a small batch that i'm making for the ginger cookies you can double the batch [Music] when i um i'll set the ingredients on next to the video like i usually do so you're just going to set that aside [Music] so now we're going to cream together the butter and the sugar let me get my mixer stand mixer [Music] ready and i have my butter right here already ready i'm just putting it into the stand mixer how are you guys doing this morning it's uh almost seven o'clock in the morning over here we're supposed to get rain today i hope so it says rain but never really get get it when it says it i'll keep my fingers crossed okay i'll go ahead and turn that towards my mixer for you okay and then the sugar we need a half and a half where is my sugars right there that's going to be a half a cup of brown and a half a cup of dark or white that goes for about two minutes so so i'm gonna get my molasses ready quarter cup of molasses and one egg that we're going to add to the mixture so you all that molasses goodness in there so i'm going to scrape down the sides a little bit make sure it's all incorporated ah [Applause] hmm and then i'm going to start adding my flower slowly a little bit at a time [Applause] uh [Applause] one more time [Music] and you're just gonna mix that until it's all incorporated [Applause] so let's take a look it looks pretty good [Music] scrape off my thing so okay and what i do is put it in a container and it's going to sit in the fridge for two hours oh my gosh the dough tastes so good [Music] like i said so this is a small batch you would double the batch for a lot more i'm doing a whole bunch of different types of cookies so i do small batches and put a little bit of each in my platters or bags or treat bags and stuff is how i usually do it all right guys so i'm gonna go ahead and put that in the refrigerator for two hours and um i'll see you guys probably in about 30 minutes i'm gonna go ahead and clean up and then i'll get ready for the the peanut butter cookies all right bye", "heJONFUrXc0": "okay we just started and i already need a break [Music] welcome to a very special episode of the silly kitchen where once again i'm gonna attempt baking this is not my favorite thing in the world and that's why you probably noticed in my list of videos there aren't very many baking videos but it's christmas and who doesn't love a christmas cookie so if you are a baker and you want to send me some cookies that would be lovely because i'm not sure that this is going to work out i'm going to attempt ginger snaps today and i got to tell you i already screwed up when preparing for this recipe i decided to put all the dry ingredients into one bowl as we then mix it with the wet ingredients however i was supposed to keep the brown sugar separate because that is the start of the wet mixture so i'm out of brown sugar i can't start over we're just gonna wing it but let's start first with the recipe this is not my own creation i googled and decided i would kind of combine one or two recipes together and figure this out so let's go do the grocery list first a cup of brown sugar which you should leave in a separate bowl you also need three quarters of a cup of soft butter a quarter cup of molasses one egg two cups of flour two teaspoons of baking soda a quarter teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of cinnamon and one teaspoon of ginger so we're going to begin and if you are trying this at home start with brown sugar and butter in your wet ingredient bowl and mix it together but because i screwed up i'm gonna start with molasses and butter and egg in my bowl as my wet start ingredients and then i'm gonna slowly put the dry ingredients of everything else in as we build the cookie dough let's go okay butter molasses hand mixer if you have one of those fancy baking mixers those are probably pretty cool [Applause] [Music] okay we just started and i already need a break i think of champagne break okay i think we can continue dry ingredients a little bit at a time i'm gonna go with i don't know if that's right see if you have a stand mixer you don't have to hold your mixer you can just click a button i don't bake very much so i don't have these tools i actually had to borrow this from my mom okay this mixer's like [Music] i don't know it's having a hard time with how thick the dough is gotten so i'm gonna just try to get some of this gooey gooey goodness off of here and i'm just gonna try mixing it with a little spatula and then maybe by hand and see what happens and i'm just gonna double check the recipe to make sure that i got all the right measurements oh this is so annoying i hope these taste good okay so i gave up on the hand mixer i gave up on the spatula and i'm just getting my hands in here and like i'm feeling like i'm making sweet pierogies because this is the kind of work i do when i make pierogies but i'm really annoyed i'm really annoyed why is baking so difficult okay we're getting somewhere though look it looks like cookie dough i'm literally getting somewhere okay this is promising [Music] i hope you all have a drink when you're baking it really helps okay guys somehow this dough smells looks and feels legit i think we're gonna have cookies [Music] i'm gonna spray a little bit of pam on my pan i don't know if we actually need this because i feel like there's enough butter and lovely things in the dough but just to be safe i'm gonna just make sure that we're nice and [Music] nice and sticky unsticky stick free and i'm just gonna roll i don't know is that a good cookie size i'm just gonna roll a ball of cookie dough and i don't know if i said this at the beginning but you want to have some coarse sugar or for me i don't know what course sugar means so i just have regular sugar and i'm gonna just dip my cookie in a little bit of sugar for the top and hope that when it melts down the sugar looks pretty like sparkles that's what it looks like on the internet i might have needed to investigate how to make cookies a little bit more before i started this video but it is the silly kitchen now guys i gotta tell you this part not so bad i'm actually enjoying doing the like rolling dipping in sugar drinking champagne this part i don't mind if someone else could do the following the recipe um putting all the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients in the ripe bowls then i could do this part this is good this is good i feel like cookies should be a teamwork thing okay here we go so while you're rolling your balls here of cookie uh preheat your oven to 375 degrees because these are going to go in once they're all ready for 10 to 12 minutes had to check my notes there cookies are out of the oven they freaking look like real cookies i have no idea how i made this happen but we haven't tasted them yet so we just don't know if they're good they look pretty close to what's on the internet should we try one i mean they're warm they're cooling down a little bit so they might be kind of soft and gooey and ooey but i think gooey chewy cookies are like my favorite probably shall we try one i'll pick the smallest one okay look at it's sparkle it's so pretty [Music] it's cooked all the way inside [Music] for how much i hate baking [Music] i love when it works out i don't know what ginger snaps are supposed to taste like but i can tell you these taste freaking delicious and goes to show you can screw up in baking and still make it happen oh my gosh [Music] guys i'm a little bit proud of myself right now i deserve the whole cookie follow my way of doing ginger snaps screw up put the brown sugar in with the dry ingredients use the molasses the egg and the butter first get your hands in there and boom you have beautiful ginger snap cookies i'm so happy and guys this made 20 cookies i still have more dough to make boom i'm going to be eating these all day all night thank you for joining me for a frustrating baking episode of the silly kitchen that turned out awesome enjoy your ginger snaps subscribe to the silly kitchen and i will see you next time you", "AHEFcVIv7b4": "hey guys it's Talia and welcome back to today I'm going to teach you how to make gluten-free gingerbread cookies I am so glad feedback on YouTube uploading videos I was away for probably like a week and a half because I was at a food bloggers conference which was amazing if any of you guys are youtubers or food bloggers get yourself out there leave your room because I know most of us be just another computer all day edit and film video so we're just alone get yourself out there make connections talk to brands and tell you that's one of the best things you could do so sign up for food blogger conference if you can because they are amazing and it's one that I went to was fantastic and then there was Thanksgiving so I hope you guys all had a great Thanksgiving mine was really really nice I ended up just cooking a small meal for me my mom and my sister and also a family friend also came by so it was excellent you would have seen it on Instagram I did a livestream showing you guys how I made the meal it was so fun so now I'm extremely excited to be back here on YouTube and I can't wait teach you guys how to make these gluten free gingerbread cookies I'm telling you they are insanely delicious I made gingerbread cookies for the first time two days ago tested the recipe and it came out fantastic normally I have to test recipes a few times this one it came out perfect the first time and I have to tell you the molasses in these cookies just makes them taste amazing and so unique and it's so so easy to make like I promise you I know I say a lot of things are easy this really really is easy there are basically a bunch of ingredients that could combine in a bowl mix it up stick in the oven and you are good to go so now let's begin so I have here large bowl everything some go in here to it you want to add all of your liquid ingredients to start with so we have here an egg vanilla extract we need vanilla and everything and also always use pure vanilla extract if you can I know it's a little bit more expensive but if you can afford it it makes a world of a difference in your baking and it's the pure stuff it's not filled with preservatives and weird ingredients then I have here some melted and cooled coconut oil we have some blackstrap molasses now there's blackstrap molasses and then there's just regular molasses that just says molasses on the bottle blackstrap molasses is much more concentrated which means it has way more flavor and it's also a little bit bitter so you don't put a ton of blackstrap molasses in your recipe this is only two and a half tablespoons some recipes that call for regular molasses might call for a little bit more if you only have access to regular molasses just get the regular molasses it might have a slightly different flavor but it should be pretty similar now all we have to do oh and add the sugar so I have here at some organic brown sugar of course if you don't buy organic you can rate use regular brown sugar too and then we're gonna whisk this up I know that a lot of you probably noticed that I'm using a lot of organic healthier ingredients lately and that's just a personal choice that I'm making because I'm trying to put better things into my body that are less processed and not bleached and all that stuff and I think it's a great idea if you want to be a little bit healthier but it does not mean that it's low carb or low fat or diet friendly it just might be healthier for your body so if you want to try it out you totally can but you do you if you wanted my regular sugar flour it's totally fine I know that ever getting it's way more expensive and I probably wouldn't be able to buy organic if it wasn't for doing it for my youtube videos and since I bake like every single day I wanted to be a little bit healthier next up we're gonna add all the dry ingredients see this is literally taking us a few seconds so I have here a ton of almond flour and I love that almond flour is our base it's a majority of a flour that's going into this recipe because it's really really really healthy it's just almond and then I have here some gluten-free flour I use the Bob dreadmill gluten-free all-purpose baking flower it worked wonders but you're not going free you could use regular all-purpose flour next I have here some baking powder cinnamon some salt and another ingredient that gives these cookies such a great flavor aside from the molasses is some ground ginger and that is a cure look to making this recipe come out great now all you have to do is mix it up so I like to use a rubber spatula you can use a spoon I would not recommend using a whisk for this because it's gonna get pretty thick and then your whisk might break which has happened before it to me so don't use a whisk use something that you could just fold it with it mix it and literally that is how you make your dough it is so easy you guys have got to make this there's no reason why you shouldn't and it's a holiday season with your celebrate Hannukah like I do or Christmas early cuantas also around this time you should totally make these cookies they really taste fabulous and just the flavors are so unique and they're not flavors that you eat all year round I have my parchment lined baking sheet and now it's time to scoop the cookies into circles so I'm gonna dip my hands and some cold water because it is a really sticky dough and you want to scoop out about one heaping tablespoon so probably end it be about one and a half tablespoons of dough then roll it and just place it on to the baking sheet and then press it down to flatten it you're gonna repeat this step with all your dough and then we'll move on to the next step and lastly we're going to sprinkle these cookies with a little bit of sugar this will also make it get a little bit crunchy on top which I love so much on the inside soft in the outsides a little bit crisp that's my favorite now I'm going to bake these in a 350 degree fahrenheit oven for about 15 minutes and I'll show you feel looks like when they're done just got them out of the oven about 15 minutes ago so they're pretty cooled and just take a look at this they have crispy exterior and the inside is just going to be super soft and filled with so much flavor I'm so excited to try this mmm this is so so but I totally get like you gonna make this for Christmas it's amazing I love trying out all these new recipes because I never made cookies with molasses before and they are fantastic it's so fun trying new things I love it so head to my website it's raining flower calm got the recipe for these cookies and should totally make them soon you probably don't even have to buy that many ingredients probably the molasses and once you happen have molasses at home which I

just using some of grandma's molasses [Music] because that is one [Music] okay let's go ahead and get started with these gingerbread cookies you guys i love this recipe and i love gingerbread cookies you don't have to have a stand mixer to make these cookies a hand mixer will work just as well i'm starting off with a half a cup of unsalted softened butter don't worry about writing this recipe down i will leave it for you guys down in my description box below to the half a cup of butter i'm going to add a half a cup of granulated sugar let's go ahead and cream those two together [Music] that's good enough to this we're going to add a half a cup of molasses a little tip for you guys if you spray your measuring cup with some pam or some nonstick spray before you put your molasses in it comes out a little bit easier let's go ahead and blend this together if you've watched me for any amount of time you know i like to scrape down my bowl quite often i would make sure everything gets incorporated perfectly you guys let's go ahead and give it like another 10 seconds and to this we're going to add one egg yolk [Music] in this sifter in the bowl i have two cups of flour half a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of baking powder half a teaspoon of baking soda half a teaspoon of cinnamon half a teaspoon of nutmeg and a full teaspoon of cloves and a full teaspoon of ginger okay let's go ahead and sift these together let's add our dry mixture to our wet mixture [Music] we're just going to blend these until they're just combined [Music] let's go ahead and finish mixing this by hand this dough will need to chill for about an hour i like to chill mine for at least four or overnight for best results i'm gonna divide this batter into about a half [Music] i'm gonna go ahead and stick this cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least four hours and i'll see you guys back in one second our gingerbread dough has been in the refrigerator overnight let's go ahead and roll it out i have not used this method of putting the cookie dough between two pieces of parchment paper to roll it out so you don't have to use flour so we're going to test this out together [Music] [Music] [Music] the parchment paper did not work for me so we were back to square one using our flour [Music] we'll get a pastry brush to brush off this flower we don't want to push too hard we don't want to make indentations on the gingerbread cookies you want to get most of that flour off [Music] in the oven they go for eight minutes we'll check on them at that time i'll see you guys back in one second oh my goodness you guys the kitchen smells so amazing i baked these for about nine to ten minutes in my oven which was preheated to 350 degrees i'm going to let them cool off on the pans for about 15 minutes and at that time i'll take them off and let them come to complete room temperature on a cooling rack before we start decorating them but i'll see you guys back in one second [Music] our gingerbread men have cooled for a couple days they are no longer warm from the oven and we are ready to decorate our gingerbread men you don't have to wait a couple days you guys it's just when i got back to this video busy busy planning for my trip to ohio to see my grandbabies that live there my youngest son tanner his wife carly garrett bryson and ken lee sue live in ohio so i am leaving in two days so i need to get some videos uploaded for you guys let's go ahead and decorate our gingerbread mint we're just doing the traditional decorating you guys i made some royal icing and kept it white i have a small atteca decorator back here and a wilton tip number three which is just a small round we're gonna start off by doing this smiley face first i think i'm gonna work my way from top to bottom little dots for eyes [Music] and a smiley face [Music] and then zigzag [Music] oops i went the wrong way oops looks like a girl skirt [Music] you guys know me i'm not a cookie decorator but i i continue to try this i think maybe one day i'll get it and you guys will witness it but so far we're a struggle bus let's go ahead and put three little dots of royal icing down the middle and put some red hots there for the gingerbreads buttons three little dots [Music] going down the middle [Music] i switched my tip from a three to a one and it seems to be working a little bit better i i'm pretty i'm 90 sure that the concern i'm having is that i've made my royal icing too thin so but we're going to continue i don't have time to fix this i have to go to ohio in two days sorry but learn from my mistakes do what i say not as i do this was a little bit better maybe by the sixth one it will look good [Music] so i think my last one turned out the best [Music] if you're a returning subscriber

holidays i haven't made it for a while because it's not one of Mike's favorites but I like it I have some friends that like them as well and they're kind of a PA Dutch classic around here and that's the soft molasses cookie so I'm going to show you how I make PA Dutch molasses cookies that are pretty well known here and amish and mennonite land and I'm using actually the last of old Chevy four-by-fours sorghum that he sent me because you want a good heavy molasses for these and it's the end of it so thank you old old Chevy 4x4 for sending me this it's going in my last recipe here so I'll show you how we put these together what goes into this is you're going to need it's four cups of flour two sticks of butter or a cup of shortening salt baking soda and egg sugar the sorghum on our heavy molasses and this will be a quarter cup of hot water to put the baking soda in so the first part of this is I'm going to add my flour and salt and just kind of mix this around good incorporate it and then you're going to take the butter for your shortening I just like the flavor a butter butter and I'm going to cut that in just like you would with pie dough or you know pastry dough [Music] [Music] and it's worth this end you'd want it crumbly and it looks that looks pretty crumbly you see it here just work to do on my pastry blender now for the next part the next part we're gonna combine our cup of sugar and our cup of molasses or sorghum [Music] no matter egg next I'm going to take the baking soda and dissolve that and a quarter cup of hot water all right you can see here my dump that in now I gotta stir this around just get this [Music] dissolved in here I'm gonna add that to this mixture okay we're gonna add this mixture to the crumbs and get that all combined and worked in [Music] this is what our dough looks like all incorporated and done and it's really stiff but we're gonna put it in the fridge to chill for about an hour and then we're gonna bake them up [Music] so the next part of these molasses cookies is the dough was chilled couple hours and I took it out and I'm actually gonna cut just break break this in half you know I don't have the biggest work surface here set that off to the side and then we're gonna roll this out normally you roll these out to about a quarter of inch thickness if you like a crispier cookie we can make it thinner if you like a little bit dull here make a little bit thicker and that looks about right to me and then we're gonna get this going cut out on a sheet that's either been greased or I'm gonna put parchment paper down like I usually do and I'm just using I don't have a special cover for this anything it's a round shape I just use a mug and or glass and that works just fine [Music] and the first tray is ready to go in [Music] first molasses cookies are out of the oven and I want you to look you can just see like a hint of color around the outsides and I don't like my I don't like my cookies hard but I can softer so but you can see they're set they're not be softer and you can see they're said underneath and then I get these on a cooling rack and here they are are the oven cooling on the racks [Music] so classes cookies are all done there just a very plain cookie you can dress them up with some sugar if you want to especially around the holiday some colored sugar you know the red and green and whatnot and pretty them up but there they are and you know comes fast you know taste test you see the back is just lightly golden brown that's it [Music] soft and chewy no I said that's what they look like to you they're nice and chewy and that's how I like them I like my cookies hard I like soft cookies you did good if you like molasses cookies you'll like these like I said this is the PA dutch version of the kind that we make around here I don't know if this is like your family's but uh they're pretty yummy no matter who's handling it is a no DIY dark matter likes these likes molasses cookies so maybe this is a recipe he'll like so where's my PA Dutch molasses cookies also part of Helga's Happy Holidays give them a try they're a great cookie to be given out this time of year they hold up well they freeze well so they're good for longer term storage those are my PA Dutch molasses cookies [Music] [Music] [Music] do you like what you saw like subscribe and join me next time here and how this Pennsylvania cooking [Music] [Applause]", "hvnda-yMZRQ": "I get up will you get down to this Kiku still get loud to this when it drop just came tonight the mics aren't off when I'm amplify so what today you will need two cups of all-purpose flour 1 cup of light brown sugar one and a half sticks of butter 1 egg on a quarter cup of dark molasses 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of ginger one quarter teaspoon of cloves half a teaspoon of cinnamon half a teaspoon of salt lets you begin eat my butter and my sugar into our mixing bowl along with a molasses we're going to beat this with our paddle attachment until it's all incorporated and nice and airy I'm going to add my scraper Bowl X I'm going to combine all my dry so I have my flour add all of my spices and my salt give it a quick whisk and then add it to our mixing bowl we're gonna mix this just until it comes together as a dough and then never cookie dough so once you have your dough all set I lined 22 cookie sheets with parchment we're going to use a scoop scoop out and even slightly heaping scoop and then just to add some shine just flatten out a little bit take some granulated sugar and just flatten it into it scoop flatten it into the sugar these are going to go into a 350-degree oven and they're going to bake for about 15 minutes when you touch them they'll be pretty firm they'll have a little bit alike crackling on top look really good cookies are all done they're sort of crackly on top they're still sort of tender but you can lift them up and you're all set thanks lot for begging me tonight I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next week", "M6ZxukkfNts": "[Music] can we all just take a moment to appreciate as christmas-tree background I wasn't even going to film today but I'm in the biggest sandy Christmas vibe ever now that it's December I feel like I need to bring in the Christmas spirit with some healthy vegan gingerbread men I like all of my best recipes I'm totally going to win this and make it up on the spot because that's how I like to bake I have good vibes about this I feel like it's going to work as long as you roughly stick to this recipe you should be fine I'm very lenient frivolous with my quantities to start off we're going to preheat our oven at 180 degrees Celsius I believe it's 375 degrees Fahrenheit I am really know I'm sort of just making that up I'll admit there's one ingredient in here that it's a bit like up in the air if it's paleo or not whatever its grain free dairy free gluten free refined sugar free animal product free all of that good stuff so the main thing I'm going to be using is blanched almond milk so I'm gonna do two cups of that one really important thing that you want to put in this butter is a type of starch so I'm going to use tapioca starch and I'm going to do a quarter cup of that so this is just going to help smoothing out your whole mixture make it a little more fluffy consistent and not so heavy and gluggy get your hands on the best quality that you can majority of my stuff is from loving earth and if you're loving over don't sell it then I usually get it from my health food store this is totally optional I just really really love carob powder it just smells like cake batter I don't know one heaped tablespoon of that again totes making this up okay next we're going to add ginger I'm just going to add powdered ginger I know a lot of people I'd like a quarter teaspoon I like half a teaspoon but if I'm gonna make gingerbread they better taste ginger II hashtag ginger do you even ginger 2 teaspoons same goes with this I'm going to add wonderful taste food Oh No there we go it's all about the angle people it's all about the angle part of teaspoon of vanilla powder humilating salt half a teaspoon yeah and whenever I cook with almond meal I feel like it needs extra baking powder just because it is such a heavy and dense ingredient I'm gonna add a half and I'll see how the mixture look you can skip this step definitely but I just love coconut sugar and if I'm going to make a dessert like I want it to be really really sweet one teaspoon of that actually two T's whatever all right let's mix that together and see how it looks normally I have like two different cameras going when I'm cooking I get it off the tripod and I do like close-up shots but seriously I wasn't planning on filming today today's like my off day to edit I like I said I was just film vibes to cook so this is just going to be more like chill relaxed video another important thing that you have to do at this stage because you can't really eat it and test it is smell it oh my gosh I forgot what the main ingredients nutmeg 1 teaspoon of nutmeg since smelling it I'm also going to add another teaspoon of cinnamon but don't be afraid to dabble with your quantities and listen to your own taste buds if you want an extra salty if you want an extra cinnamon II just do you family whoopsie oh maybe don't wear a light color you know okay it smells really good but add even more ginger want this flavor to punch me in the face honestly smells like my childhood when my mom would make normal gingerbread men and like no wonder they made me feel so sick because I didn't know I was cooler intolerant and I would eat like 20 time to get Yui again a good quality coconut oil and I'm hoping mine is liquefied somewhat make sure you melt your coconut oil but I'm just gonna Chuck my name like this but make a well in the middle of your dry ingredients you can do it in a separate bowl then I just hate washing up a lot of stuff so if I can do it in one Bowl I'm winning two heaped tablespoons oh and for those of you who are asking in my last video I'll do still have the 25 percent off code for loving so totes feel free to use that this is the ingredient that is a bit up in the air if it's paleo however it is absolutely packed full of vitamins and minerals organic blackstrap molasses whoa it smells like a really strong version of this syrup from loving earth I think I always say it wrong yuck on your Kuhn yakin I don't know so I'm going to use both of these so a quarter cup of this oh that looks fun oh my gosh it was good everywhere if you don't have the blackstrap molasses or the Yukon u  whatever this syrup you can use agave nectar maple syrup honey tablespoon of the akan syrup and then I'm going to mix that all up and see what the consistency is like and as you can see it's still super crumbly teaspoon more of the coconut oil teaspoon of the yacon syrup a teaspoon of the molasses I feel like I'm at the point where I need to take my rings off and use my hands I just want the full sensory experience Mel's the taste the texture I'm happy with that consistency it is a little bit sticky but when we're rolling it out I'm going to add some more tapioca starch to roll it out so it is going to dry out quite a bit but I'm going to do a taste test whoa black strap molasses is really really strong I sort of wish I didn't les lock strap a bit more coconut sugar your corn syrup however I'm very interested to see what this tastes like when it's cool [Music] my whole apartment smells like gingerbread so good and a side note I was wondering why everyone always decorates their gingerbread men that's like currants cranberry and no one ever uses anything colorful like goji berries well sisters there's a reason because in the oven goji berries apparently turn a lovely brown yellow mustard color for my mistakes and don't use goji berries and then I love how these little stars came out very snow flaky that's what they look like a cute little snowflake with the coconut the caramelized bikinis I had them in the oven for eight minutes and that was perfect and I'm actually really happy with the consistency but look you could totally put that on top of someone's gift ah that's what I should have done you could puncture a hole in its head that sounds so violent then thread a piece of string through and like use it as a card and bright like Emily alright Curt oh my gosh I want to like read from this video and do that I'm not going to do that because that's like so much it oh why don't I think of that now unfortunately I actually like to look at the Stars better than the gingerbread man because I feel like they look a little bit of a joke so let's just lay these on top of each other and put I decided to take test the ugly one this was the one that I tried to make look like me I mean she has my arms now because I've eaten her but they're really gooey and chewy my toes are really good you can definitely taste the molasses so I wish I'd put like a tablespoon left but they're really good I think that is going to wrap up this video I really hope you guys enjoyed it if you did please give it a thumbs up because it really supports my channel and it also helps me know that you guys are loving excessive Christmas as well because I'm having such a good time making these videos it's actually the highlight of my day also make sure to subscribe because the absolute new videos every three days I'll see you guys in my next video this is dangerous I should have made these but I'm home alone except when I eat them all I need a call Kurt I'm telling you I'm a gingerbread man how accountable that there's some left over when he's home because sometimes I just beg when I tell no one and I eat it all and no one ever knows you", "blKCLBWudZ0": "hey guys today we're making this\nbeautiful and delicious selection of cookie this is perfect for custom cookie\nbox for a bake sale or to just have a round for your family and friends and no\nwe're not taking  cookie dough and just shaping it differently that's\ntoo easy for us I'm going to show you how to make one simple base dough and\nthen quickly transform it into completely different cookie dough's\ndifferent flavors different style cookies this is the way professionals\nquickly make different cookies so we're going to make the basic cookie\ndough which is different than your typical cookie dough and then I'm going\nto show you how to take that and make different types and different style\ncookies just by adding additional ingredients to the same recipe we'll\nalso talk about fillings today as we go along because the filling you decide to\nuse will determine how well these cookies will keep or how fast they will\ndeteriorate to the creamed butter I've gone ahead and added the powdered sugar\nI'm using vanilla powdered sugar today regular powdered sugar is perfectly fine\nto use just make sure to add some vanilla extract as well to your cookie\ndough and once those are combined you can add the X today we're using just the\negg whites if you're new to my channel make sure to subscribe and click that\nnotification bell I post new videos every week at this point we're ready to\nadd the flour and salt in three additions do not add the flour all at\nonce this is a lot of cookie dough we want to make sure everything is well\ncombined do not be afraid to mix this thoroughly this recipe contains so much\nbutter that there won't be any gluten development okay\nthe texture of these cookies is quite interesting and amazing I always like to\nuse the phrase melt in your mouth but these cookies will literally melt in\nyour mouth when you try these cookies you'll fully understand what I mean by\nthat they have the most amazing unique cookie texture now this dough will be\nquite so that's perfect that's how you want it to\nbe we need to start off with a very soft dough because we will be adding more\ningredients as we go along you're going to take the dough and divide it evenly\ninto five bowls I do like to use a scale for this if you love to bake please\ninvest in a scale if you don't have one though just make sure as I said you\ndivide the dough evenly with a large ice cream scoop into five bowls or you can\neven just place the dough onto some parchment paper and use the same Bowl to\nmix you know one cookie dough at a time the first cookie recipe we're going to\nbe making are Linzer cookies I feel it's such a must cookie for the holidays so\ndo your first bowl you're going to add some almond or hazelnut flour whichever\nyou like best you'll also need some additional flour because Linzer cookies\nare cut out style cookies the extra flour will really help these retain\ntheir shape now I did add off-camera some almond extract I've forgot to add\nit while I was mixing the dough so you do want to add it and eventually you'll\nhave to switch from your spatula to your hands that's the fastest way to bring\nthe dough together unless you're obviously using a stand mixer take the\nfirst cookie dough and place it between two pieces of parchment paper spread it\nout using your hands or a rolling pin and you're going to pop this in the\nfridge while we make the other cookie dough's the second cookie recipe we're\ngoing to make our gingerbread style cookies\nso do your cookie dough you're going to add some ginger cinnamon and additional\nflour and cocoa powder the cocoa powder is mainly there for color because we\nwon't be adding any molasses today I really wanted to include gingerbread\ncookies in this video because I feel it's such a staple holiday cookie\nhowever if you're anything like my nephew who really does not like\ngingerbread cookies you should definitely try this recipe because as I\nsaid there's no molasses so the flavor is a lot more delicate it's almost like\neating a snickerdoodle with the addition of ginger it's\ndelicious pop the dough into the fridge and we're\ngoing to make the classic the most you know holiday-ish the classic vanilla cut\nout sugar cookie now this one is quite simple all you need is extra vanilla\nextract and again some additional flour to hold that cutout cookie shape sugar\ncookies are probably my favorite holiday cookie they're delicious plain they're\ndelicious frosted or iced and they're so versatile you could even add some\nsprinkles or a drop of red food coloring to make these even more festive pop the\ndough into the fridge and we're going to make chocolate sugar cookies for a deep\nchocolate flavor you do want to bloom the cocoa powder just make sure you're\nmaking a paste rather than a liquid mixtures of the dough won't be wet this\nis a cookie dough it's not a cake okay go ahead add the additional flour I felt\nthat our cookie box really needed some kind of chocolate cookie chocolate is\nalways a good idea and it's perfect for the holidays I do also want to mention\nthat you can make all of these cookie dough's up to ten days in advance and\nthen just pop them in the fridge until ready to use or you can bake the cookies\nand store them in an airtight container for up to a week it's a great dough with\nthe remaining cookie dough so the fifth one we're going to make piped butter\ncookies and I'm going to show you how to pipe these cookies these will take some\npractice it's not something you learn overnight but I'm going to show you a\nreally simple shape that you can make that looks beautiful using a star tip\nonto some parchment paper you're going to pipe an S shape I remember the first\njob I got as a pastry cook this was way back this shaft holds me it's not so\nmuch the shape you do it's about being consistent with that shape and size if\nyou can make these all the same shape and size that's all that matters and I\nreally do think that's true so make these\nany shape you like but try to be consistent with that shape you're going\nto pop these into the fridge for about half an hour before you bake these okay\nso after half an hour at this point your dough should be chilled you're going to\nflour your work area and roll out the dough to about 1/4 1/4 of an inch\nthickness now this recipe I'm giving you makes a lot of cookies you can easily\nget around three to four cookie boxes obviously it depends on how big or small\nyou want your cookie box to be I know I'm going to get asked how many cookies\nthis recipe makes and it really comes down to the size and shapes you're\nmaking however you'll roughly get around I want to say 100 cookies place the\ncookies onto your prepared cookie sheet or cookie sheets and bake the cookies at\n170 degrees Celsius or 340 Fahrenheit for around 15 minutes okay so let's talk\nabout fillings now if you're having a bake sale or your gifting these or you\njust want to make these ahead of time for your family it's best if you choose\nfillings that keep well Jam is a great option you can use homemade or\nstore-bought there's so many flavors to choose from melt a chocolate dark milk\nwhite you have so many options or you could also just go for the classic royal\nicing I didn't make it for this video but I'll put in the description box a\nlink to that video and I also explained in that video how to decorate cookies\nusing royal icing vanilla buttercream or chocolate buttercream is another option\nhowever it won't be as stable as the other ones you could even just make a\nsimple glaze with powdered sugar water and vanilla the last option is to just\nkeep these plain last year I made cookie bags I'll insert a picture for you and I\nleft the cookies plain plain simple cookies are delicious and that's also\nanother simple way to package cookies you can easily get around 10 to 12 bags\nof cookies I'm using my square cake pans today this\nis just to give you an idea how to package these cookies but obviously use\na normal box with a lid or you can wrap the box with cellophane do not buy any\ncookies this year make these yourself cookies are one of those treats that are\namazingly simple to make and no store-bought cookies will come even\nclose to your beautiful and delicious selection of homemade cookies no\nstore-bought cookies will look or taste like that the texture of these cookies\nlike I said it's very unique and melt in your mouth no other cookie will have\nthat extra and that amazing flavor", "IFXONnD-8n4": "hi my name is BC Hoffmann and I made your Bustamante and this is recipe Wars and today we're doing ginger cookies so I'm actually super super super super super excited I'm doing Martha Stewart's and yes I'm super excited to do Martha Stewart's I know but never seen someone so excited view of Martha Stewart recipes gingerbread cookies gonna make one of my favorite cookies chewy chocolate gingerbread cookies which what's in the dough Sara cocoa powder it's a few ingredients but fresh ginger and chocolate chunks and cocoa powder and flour and butter ingredients so you're making a like a these are pretty big these are one-and-a-half inch balls and then once you make the balls and roll them and while they get chilled and then they get rolled in sugar I love this part oh and they're chocolate gingerbread cookies no it makes it so much better because what's better than chocolate and ginger I mean really you put bacon in there maybe that would be and if money showers going on so I'm really excited about my spices I've got my cinnamon and nutmeg my cloves my cocoa powder i salt my ginger powder then again I also have fresh grated ginger which I'm gonna be throwing in there and that is gonna be awesome and then on top of that I've got my chocolate going in semi-sweet chocolate seven ounces of pure delight going in everything's gonna be combined with some nice butter we're gonna have some delicious ginger chocolate cookies and I'm doing Paula Dean's recipe for the gingerbread cookies it is a classic recipe I want to show you a wonderful ginger cookie this is gonna be so so good with our butter pecan ice cream now I'm gonna start with 3/4 a cup of shortening I'm gonna add a cup of sugar I'm gonna add one egg and 1/4 of a cup of molasses there's no chocolate chips in mind which will disappoint it on but like I said I'm making classic gingerbread cookies so I'm gonna do it this way the biggest difference was between mine and Martha Stewart to Paula Deen's and Martha Stewart's is he's using butter and I'm using shortening shortening shortening and we're using the same spices in mine as NBC's just - the cocoa powder so I'm ready to get started you let's do this little bird little graph by putting shortening in with my sugar now we're gonna cream this together and funny thing about this we're actually not making a cream per se it's a little bit of a misnomer but just need blending these together to make sure they mix while you're doing that I'm actually gonna grate the ginger know a little side note make sure that you have your oven temperature preheated right now yours is going at 325 I believe 359 325 I'm glad we got that out of the way and corrected so I'm gonna grate my ginger first trick to do when you're going that is make sure you just want to take a quick spoon and just get that excess skin right off peel it that way so the reason why the spoon works really well on ginger is not only does it not take off too much of the actual appeal it also gets right in between the nooks and the crannies of your ginger so you're really getting every little bit of that skin right off and keeping the majority of the flesh of your ginger root so all you're gonna do is you're gonna take your flour and then once you've got your flour in the bowl you're gonna take all your spices and you're just gonna knock those right on in there boom and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna stick the flour with our whisk and this makes it really just a nice and aerated aerated perfectly so that way it's good for your cookie so it really works well is when you sift this with the whisk or with an actual sifter it actually aerates it makes the cookie lighter there's no lumps and it actually combines everything really well so you at home have a nice fluffy delicious ginger chocolate cookie so that's sifted right there and I am ready to use the mixture yeah well I'm just almost done this is just about ten creaming what I'm gonna also gonna do while it's going is I'm going to add an egg as well as some molasses I don't know how big of a fan you are molasses but I mean it just it is the the main ingredient to a gingerbread cookie now if for some reason you have an aversion to molasses you can use substitutes like honey maple syrup or even sweet sorghum syrup which is often mistaken for molasses but I mean if you really want a real gingerbread cookie molasses and here's the thing if you're using brown sugar already you kind already are using molasses because all that is is just granulated sugar that has molasses added to it for the colorization and also the flavor you just smell that like deep rich flavor coming off the coming out the mixer it's great and you may just have to kind of get in there a little bit with a soft spatula and do this at home when the actual beater is off just a side note I mean it's safer but this is faster this is recipe Wars now while he's doing that I'm gonna do the same exact thing he was doing with all my spices and my flour just basically kind of whisk them all together so you get going on that so I'm about to start mixing before I do I'm gonna throw in my butter I've got eight tablespoons of butter you got throw in my oh I think good stuff get it going right on in there just get it all out of it yes I'm gonna throw in my brown sugar and some fresh and delicious ginger know if anything about ginger is actually used in some areas across the world is like a medicine as well I know like Burma it's used to try and treat flu symptoms but it's a digestive actually it's everything like I've started reading more up on it just got a new we're going it's used for so many different things it's a medicine it's like you said a digestive obviously a spice so little-known fact in 998 it was actually first introduced by an Armenian monk and then after that in the 13th century none started using it as a digestive and in the 16th century it was actually started to be sold in monasteries all over and then I got popularity and next thing you know gingerbread cookies were everywhere so I'm gonna start doing the gingerbread method on this bad boy right here so the gingerbread method is basically mixing them slowly into the process of your fats after you've actually mixed all your fats together you then add slowly add in the Tri ingredients and that's the gingerbread method makes cake making a lot easier yeah just do it up a little bit more there you go boom and I am ready to start putting it I'm going to put in half of my flour real quick so you can actually do a couple different things instead of using all-purpose flour you can use wheat flour because we are doing a ginger cookie it's gonna have such strong flavor from the cinnamon the cloves the ginger and nutmeg that you're really gonna be able to cover up that wheat flour taste that you would get another thing you do is you can use canola oil in place of butter and or because it's less saturated fat than the butter itself would have and or you can use apple sauce there's a bunch of different ways as like you were saying with the sugars yeah apple sauce is a grater you can actually did apple sauce is a substitute for things like double oil that you might be using when you're cooking as well so it's also just a good substitute err trying to be a little bit healthier when cooking or if you have somebody that maybe can't have a lot of cholesterol in their foods and things like that the other thing you're gonna throw in your baking soda right now throw that right on in there and then you're good to go once that's in with the rest of your flour pop that up and then lastly we're gonna throw in our chocolate and mix that bad boy up it's beginning to feel a lot like ginger cookies and one of the big things you want to make sure is you don't want to over mix your cookie dough you don't want to over handle the dough because it's just about being light and airy and keeping it so it's not gonna be tough basically you're gonna end up getting a dried-out cookie and no one wants to dry it out cooking no all right now I'm gonna do the same exact thing BC just did slowly incorporate all my dry ingredients here and I'm sure you're gonna get started on actually getting your cookies ready to bake yes but before you do that another key is make sure you want this dough to rest and chill and with all cookies with all bread you want it to rest at bare minimum for about two hours so we are going to form these and then throw them in to the fridge now the key is another thing is that this recipe actually calls for it to be patted down and put in the fridge just in like almost like a patty form before you actually ball it up I'm just gonna bow it up and let it chill that way you get it nice and cold that's what you're looking at right that's the good stuff I think all of them are going we want about one inch there's cops for one and a half for one yeah one and a half but yeah usually it's one and a half is a little bit larger of a cookie so I might just for cooking purposes go for that one inch and so not making a giant cookie I would like to have a little bit more cookies than necessarily just for cookies in my oven I'm going for the bigger ones there you go going one inch but the other thing is you want to make sure that you have space so we're gonna actually knock it so we have about 2 inches in space apart give or take you don't want those cookies blending together and making one giant or new evil so I've just made my gingerbread cookies into balls and I was a bathroom and sugar and I realized you know what this tray is either way too small or the cookies are way too big so I'm actually gonna cut these basically in half and make smaller balls before I roll them into the sugar so I'm just gonna do perfect balls you're going small I'm small I'm going smaller and then you're just gonna give them a nice roll in the sugar man Bam Bam and then drop them right back down I'm doing the same exact thing get all that sugar over it I didn't have a peace of mind oh just now and it's just something about gingerbread dough it just brings me back just cookie dough in general it's the beautiful thing about mine is I won't get salmonella like you will because mine actually has no egg whereas yours on the other hand does so if you start coughing and spitting up I'll understand why I am not advising people at home to eat raw eggs I'm gonna tell you what it's gonna take a lot of raw egg to get you salmonella poisoning so remember rocky drinking rides of the glass like he did just fine we both informed our cookies and we're ready to throw them in the oven now I'm gonna pop mine in at first I'm actually gonna chill mine and I'm gonna pop it in the oven and 350 for about 12 minutes or so just kind of keeping an eye on and to make sure they're not burning or getting too to brown but they come ready to go and I'm gonna do the same thing at 325 for 8 to 10 minutes and we're ready to do this and just so you know if you have extra batter at home you don't have to make all the cookies at once they're only gonna really be good for one to two days unless you have them in an airtight container so take that extra and throw it in the freezer it's good for like a month if you have the cover and you can pull them out whenever you're ready to bake more or you could just gorge on cookies cookie dough let's do it just cleaned up and now it's time to taste the ginger cookies before we go into actually tasting them just a little side note to know that they're officially ready besides knowing it by scent another way to tell is by the crack see those little cracks and on these ones right here with the chocolate it's a little bit harder because of the fact that there is chocolate in there so you're like oh is it burnt is it ready it's ready as soon as you see the cracks and soon as you smell it so that being said it's taste now we'll do yours first okay all right let's do it chocolate ginger you get those immense you know that ginger flavor but it's not really overpowering which you got to really watch out you don't put too much ginger in your recipe it cos gonna really overpower that that cookie and make it a terrible terrible cookie this is a great mixture and they talked about chips actually add to it I've had some instances where I've had desserts in the past with like a ginger chocolate type mixture that something just doesn't seem right but it's a it's a good complement they do company each other yeah it's no bitterness the fresh ginger really stands out and the chocolate just makes it ooh and gooey and delicious and it's again both of these are great for any holiday party do you don't want to spend money on a gift just make some ginger cookies and you have these at home for holidays Hanukkah Kwanzaa Christmas whatever it is you got the perfect gift right here let's try yours try this the gingerbread cookie this is a classic gingerbread cookie it's classic I mean this is when I have when I have a gingerbread man this is what I want to taste like because I love it because it's not really it's not like hard like you get some gingerbread cookies it's partially because they might be sitting out for a longer time but they're not soft no this is so soft so this is a little bit drier this is nice and moist I mean the difference between these two and the reason obviously mine is gonna be a little I wouldn't call it dry necessarily but it's just more crumbly than his is because of the butter at vs. mind which has a shorty so no I'm little torque is like this mine is definitely a gingerbread cookie words obviously you can taste the ginger in yours but then I'm getting more of like a chocolate chip cookie so now it's that question of are we going purest gingerbread cookie or are we going I'm gonna go you know what I know we most cooking is you want the taste and that's what you want out of it and I think these are both unbelievably great tasting cookies but just as a tiebreaker for myself I'm going purist and for your viewers at home from the recipe wars kitchen I totally have to say I love the ginger cookie I mean this is this is exactly what you want when you get a gingerbread cookie to a tea but I with you I would highly recommend trying both these at home make the chocolate one at home I'm not a huge chocolate fan but it's darn delicious the fresh ginger really stands out but classic so unfortunately Martha Stewart's chocolate ginger cookie not the winner came in second amazing Paula Deen's classic gingerbread cookie came in first as the winner both of these are amazing perfect holiday cookies holiday gifts right here make them at home my name is BC Hoffman I made reboost amante this has been recipe wars please subscribe

delicious cookie recipe for you this is oatmeal raisin cookies and we add a couple of interesting twists to this because we like our cookies to be interesting but it's really a very simple recipe very delicious nice tender soft cookies let's get started with our ingredients so we're going to use some rolled oats some flour brown sugar vanilla raisins and we're using rum soaked raisins for this a little bit of cinnamon some salt baking powder and baking soda an egg and some butter so as with so many cookie recipes we are going to start by creaming the butter and sugar together now this recipe uses entirely brown sugar there's no white sugar in this it's just going to be the butter mixed with the brown sugar so we're going to get everything into our mixer together and we're going to start that up we're just going to get that creamed nicely together until they're well combined nice and fluffy and while it's mixing we're also going to add in our cinnamon or vanilla and this is a great time to add that in so that it gets really well distributed through the through the ingredients and then we're also going to add in our baking soda baking powder and that little bit of salt for all of our leavening and every once in a while you do want to make sure that you're getting everything well combined you want to make sure there aren't any lumps of butter that aren't mixed with sugar so just give everything a good scrape down the sides make sure that you are keeping everything moving in there we're making a pretty small batch here this is about as little as we could possibly make without using uh basically a hand whisk this is the smallest amount we could possibly make in a stand mixer like this and then back to mixing then we're going to add our egg and let that mix in and again just make sure that uh from time to time while you're mixing everything gets mixed gets stirred together you get all the way down to the bottom and stir everything up and if there's any bits of material stuck on your beaters it's a great time to just scrape it off and make sure that everything is getting well combined now for our raisins we are going to actually chop these up a little bit so here's our our raisins that we've soaked in rum we use nice dark sort of sweet rum for this actually we use kraken but any kind of dark sweet rum is good for this um black more is uh or sorry blackwell is one that i quite enjoy if you can find that at your local shop um but uh yeah it just adds this really interesting uh you know slightly grown up flavor to your oatmeal raisin cookies it's quite delicious with the cinnamon and everything in there works very very well so we're going to toss this in we just want to give it a little bit of a stir to make sure it's mixed in with our wet ingredients in there but we don't want to completely mix it in because we still have to add in our dry so we're still going to be adding in the oats and the flour in just a moment here so we just want them to be slightly mixed in so here comes the flower followed by the oats and now we're just going to add we're just going to mix it very slightly we just want to stir it enough that it's well combined we don't want to over mix it because we want to keep that tenderness to the cookies we don't want it to be too stodgy or too tough or anything so once it gets to about this point we're going to show you the whole mixing process here once it gets to this point we do want to give it a stir again we want to scrape down the sides and make sure that we're scooping up everything on the bottom to so there's no chunks of flour or chunks of butter and sugar that aren't mixed with the flour and oats you can see there's some little bits at the bottom there that aren't quite mixed in so you want to stir those up you want to make sure you're getting everything well combined in there so once you've got everything scraped down again we're just going to pop that beater back down and we're going to give it another very short little mixing here and that's it that's the whole thing they are done at this point so from here we're just going to scrape everything off the beater but these are ready to go so we're going to start making these into individual cookies easiest way to do this it's a very sticky batter so the easiest way to do this is with a couple of spoons and like many cookie recipes that we've shown you before these freeze extremely well so one of the best ways to do this is to just get a bunch of cookie balls like this divided up and portioned out and then freeze them just put them uh in the freezer put them in the ziplock bag in the freezer and whenever you want fresh cookies just take out four or six or whatever you need and pop them on a baking sheet and bake them we're also going to bake some of them fresh as well so those are going to go on a silpat into our preheated oven and about halfway through they are going to get turned around you can see they're starting to spread a little tiny bit now this recipe doesn't spread into very very flat cookies it does spread a little bit but it's not going to be super super thin flat cookies they do maintain a little bit of loft and there you can see it a little bit of browning around the edge nice and dark along the outside they're pretty crispy on the bottom we're going to leave them in the pan to cool just to let that carry over finish and you can see how nice and tender they are beautiful soft cookies full of that beautiful rummy raisin flavor inside goes perfect with coffee or tea and that's it that's the whole thing very very simple cookie recipe if you're not a big fan of raisins you can put other kinds of fruit in there you can use dried cranberries or something like that dried apricots will also work in this and you can mix up what kind of booze if you want to use booze to reconstitute your dried fruit that is perfectly fine absolutely delicious so we hope you give this a try if you

tablespoon of cocoa powder so this is your dry ingredients and now you can add your pack a cup of molasses secret for dealing with molasses if you spray your cup measure with a little bit of vegetable

spicy kick up it doesn't call for nutmeg but not I'm not close it says ginger in it baking soda baking soda just like the kind that you used to make your fridge that smell so just go by the recipe

paper towel according to my one fourth of a recipe I no use point one eighth of a cup of sugar have that measurement point 18 look um so this is less than a fourth and then we're going to flip it up

molasses one egg and some water then you'll mix the dry ingredients into the wet [Music] ingredients [Music] do the cookie dough is a little sticky so divide it in two flatten into discs wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for two [Music] hours [Music] after the cookie dough has chilled roll it out to be about a quarter inch thick and use my gingerbread house pdf for the shapes [Music] i find it best to roll this cookie dough out in between two pieces of parchment paper this is a very sticky cookie dough and i just find that in between two pieces of parchment is the easiest [Music] [Music] place the pieces on a lined baking sheet touch up the edges if needed then bake at 350. [Music] two tools i highly recommend for your gingerbread house are a squeeze bottle for the royal icing for constructing the gingerbread house and a piping bag fitted with a star tip for decoration [Music] i find that it's easier to assemble the chimney separately and then add it on top of the house [Music] don't be afraid to go heavy on the royal icing fill in any voids that you see [Music] so

vegan.com ginger molassic ginger gingerbread vegan ginger molasses cookies so yeah i'm excited so we're basically just gonna put everything in one bowl what we're gonna need is two cups of all-purpose flour next we're going to need half a tablespoon of cinnamon some pumpkin pie spice um probably going to need so what do they say they want half a tablespoon so we're just gonna eyeball that okay that's good and then we're gonna need okay oh one teaspoon of ginger how much baking soda one teaspoon okay one teaspoon of baking soda guys look and maybe i'm not built for the kitchen but it's okay who am i kidding yes i am and just whisk it all in whisk it all together that's looking really good actually now we have to see when we need to put in the molasses in a larger bowl mess together whisk together melted butter brown sugar molasses and vanilla okay so the recipe asked for half a cup of vegan butter but what you could use instead is just some coconut oil add some nice flavoring to it okay so now we are in the process of mixing the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients so now you should have a ball of dough that roughly resembles this [Music] so i just tried a little bit because some of it stuck to the bottom and i would not recommend using whole wheat how would you re-raise them world's better it has more variety of taste there's more to explore why i can't jingle bell

the now almost completely deserted good eats Test Kitchen Hey they closed all the schools so all those kids are home so you're gonna need some cookies right just to keep them quiet you know come on so this is kind of a good news/bad news cookie the good news is incredibly simple made with very few ingredients that you probably have sitting in your pantry right now also good news gluten free all right there's no flour in this I'm not I don't really care about that but I know that a lot of people do the bad news is if you're allergic to peanuts and I know a lot of kids like my daughter are well you can't have these but I'm not allergic to peanut butter or peanuts so that means I can eat more of these and there's the good news although that's just gonna make me fat so that's bad okay let's just make cookies so I have a peanut butter 268 grams smooth peanut butter it's just Jeff okay nothing special it's just somebody will pick that out I also have two different sugars light brown sugar and regular granulated sugar 120 grams of each that would basically be half a cup of each but of course the brown sugar would be packed and I really don't like measuring that way because one person's fact is another person's semi unpacked so let's just go 120 grams I have one egg we're also going to use one teaspoon of baking soda one teaspoon of vanilla extract and a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt I arrange things very often from the higher amount to the lower amount because it helps me to memorize the recipes which I like to do so 268 121 1-1 1/4 great all right now the oven I have set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit yes we could do that in metric but I'm not thinking that way yet so let's just say 350 rack is in the middle the only tools that we're going to need bowl for mixing and some mixing utensils we're gonna go old-school with just the the wooden spoon and I'm also going to use a Disher to distribute these I want one ounce portions I'm going to them and see if I hit one ounce but having a Disher is gonna make that a lot easier and I've got a little spatula because this stuff is sticky and you need a spatula when stuff is sticky so the first thing that we're going to do peanut butter goes in first please don't make any jokes about how that looks there we go the sugar both sugars go in and then just kind of work this around I suggest you make children that's my suggestion is you make children do this and I would say that you know it's all about teaching them to value things and that if you want the cookie you I don't have to make the cookie but really it's just about making them do work so that you can go off and do something else like the good old days when we made children to do work around the farm same thing now that they're home and in your face all day long all day long they should have to do something all right now here I'm gonna scrape off my spoon see you always need a spatula always need a little rubber spatula and I'm gonna work this now we're just kind of at the back of the spoon and this is almost like imitating the creaming method where you're kind of punching holes and the peanut butter they're gonna make a hole for the egg now is a good time to also add the baking soda this is not baking powder this is baking soda one teaspoon go I'm also gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla extract don't do that over the bowl just in case you spill it there we go last thing is the salt we're only gonna go with a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt and stir to combine and we want this really smooth let's just fast-forward through this part and that is what your dough should look like at this point this could be refrigerated for you know what who cares we would make cookies right away wouldn't wait to do so we're gonna need two cookie pants or two sheet pans these are half sheet pans we use a lot of these here and in the good eats Test Kitchen because we like them and they're cheap and they're aluminum so we're gonna put only eight cookies on each of these because there is a fair amount of spread and as I said I have a one ounce by volume Disher which is wrong that's one ounce by volume this is heavier I'm just now remembering when I wrote this recipe so I'm gonna switch that out yeah this will be better this is a one and a half tablespoon which should be about an ounce by weight let's see if that works out so all I'm gonna do is dose these out try to get the spacing right one two I know it doesn't look like a lot but these things do spread and I want to give them room to do so see if I've got this dosed properly let's just fast-forward through this part Wow well that pretty much worked out I'll lick this out when you're not watching okay now time to give these cookies their distinctive look and for that we need a fork let's see I've got a few choices here the tine marks are gonna matter so you know what I think I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with this one because it has narrower tines with a little more space make a nicer texture on the the cookie so I'm just gonna start over here and mash down and then kind of swipe like that I'm gonna do them all in one direction and then I'll come back and do them in the other direction now I don't mind them being a little on the rustic side if you want yours to be perfectly smooth then you could take the balls and make them all perfect and pretty before you mash the cookies I don't really care about that kind of thing so I'm not going to I like mine to look a little sloppy now notice I'm not just picking up the fork that would make a mess I'm kind of sliding it all right you shouldn't need to use any flour or anything like this like that if you do this properly I know some folks like to bake on those silicone mats are so Pat's as we call them I don't like this for these cookies I think they spread to much so go with parchment paper which it's not the same as wax paper don't use the wax paper that'll be like making crayons that's very different okay now I'm going the other way with the fork to make the famous crosshatch peanut butter cookie pattern that has been famous for pretty much ever ultimately you're looking for a diameter of uh I'd say that one's just about perfect so it's about just at two and a half inches across metal ruler in the kitchen very very valuable because especially if like somebody reaches for a cookie when it's not ready yet again not picking up sliding all right into the 350 degree oven I want to shoot for the middle of the box these will not fit - to Iraq so I'm gonna put one on the top middle and one on the lower middle if that makes any sense the middle as quickly as possible so we don't let any heat out any more than we need to and I'm going to set my timer for a mere 10 minutes that's all it's gonna take okay sliding them off the pan that early might be a mistake I think I'll let these cool for a second on the rack before I slide them off those are those are gonna go to the bad children simply allow the cookies to cool on the parchment on top of cooling racks for efficiency for about 10 minutes before devouring Wow that's a darn fine cookie and it doesn't have any gluten in it and it's got almost no ingredients in it and you've probably already got this stuff already in the pantry I'll just save this for later as for all of these let's just say now I can control all the children not coughing [Music]", "ULegyUwJHRo": "this is about the cookies that my grandmother whose name was Elizabeth Stites Hannah he made for years and years and all the grandchildren remember Gibby's cookies more than most anything else about her so now this is her great-granddaughter Betsy Morley whose real name is Elizabeth hunt after her great-grandmother and she is watching the cookies bake which is not very exciting mmm cookie burn now she's pulling the cookies out because they couldn't cook very fast we have to be very careful these are called molasses cookies they have molasses in them a lot of molasses a lot of cinnamon and a lot of ginger and they're supposed to be very crisp but not quite this person but they aren't supposed to be burned this is the dough for the molasses cookies we made it yesterday and put it in the refrigerator and you can see how stiff it is because the spoons are standing right up in it but that's a good thing now Betsy is demonstrating the most important part of making molasses cookies and that is smashing them out with your fingers and it's the thinness that you get that makes them especially tasty and unique cookies that you buy in the store that call themselves gingersnaps don't snap like these these are much better also this was a technique that my grandmother used to amuse small children who came to stay with her namely her grandchildren because you could put a small child up on the counter there next to the cookie sheet for arm down and they would dip their fingers in the water and smash down the cookies very enthusiastically and all of us and their 11 grandchildren all of us remember smashing down the molasses cookies when we went to visit our grandmother the music in the background is not authentic nor is the beer that this particular Baker is using to lubricate this job I can assure you that my grandmother neither listened to DVDs with blues music or drank beer while she was making a licensed cookies", "snX6XBFWmU4": "[Music] hi everyone and welcome back to Queen G's recipes and today we are going to be making a holiday classic which is my gingerbread men cookies they are so wonderful so delicious you can cut them into any shapes that you like but today we will be making gingerbread men and we will also be decorating them with some royal icing but I will talk about that when we get to that time so the ingredients we'll be needing here are first of all some all-purpose flour I have also added baking soda and a little bit of baking powder some eggs some spices which are cinnamon ginger cloves nutmeg some salt as well we will also need some softened butter at room temperature and here we have a mixture of sugars we have some white sugar and some brown sugar we will also need some molasses and some vanilla extract and you will also need your cookie cutters and for now we won't be preheating our oven but when it is time to preheat our oven we need to preheat it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit so let's move on to making our gingerbread cookies okay so the first thing we are going to do is we are going to add in our spices and salt into our flour baking soda and baking powder and just give it a little mix okay so we will set our dry ingredients aside and now we will add in our softened butter into our mixing bowl and we will also add in both of our sugars and we are going to cream these together okay this looks perfect now we will add in our vanilla extract and we will also add in our molasses and mix too well combined now we are ready to add in our egg and egg yolk and mix again okay so this is what your batter should look like right now and you want to make sure that all your ingredients are well mixed together and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to sift in all of my dry ingredients [Music] now we will mix everything until well combined just keep in mind not to overmix once you've added your dry ingredients our dough looks and smells so good and now what we're going to do is we are going to separate our dough into two disks and we're going to wrap them in some plastic wrap and we're going to place them in our fridge for about 45 minutes and then we can roll them out and now we will place our dough in the fridge to chill for about 45 minutes okay so my dough was in the fridge for one hour now I'm only going to take it one at a time when we're done with this one then we'll remove the other one so we'll just leave the other one in the fridge okay I just have a bowl with some flour here okay that we will place pull the dough on our flour and place a little bit on top of the dough you also want to have your cookie cutters ready as well we're just gonna roll it out okay so now you want to take your cookie cutter and just kind of roll it in a little bit of flour and you also want to have your cookie sheets already lined with some parchment paper so you can start placing them on there [Music] okay so when rolling out your dough you want to make sure that you roll it out to about a 1/8 of an inch thickness so that is perfect so this is what they will look like just try and rip off any excess flour and then we're ready to place them on our cookie sheets okay so now with your scraps here you just want to re put them together again roll them out and make some more cookies so at this time you need to make sure that you have your oven preheating to 350 degrees Fahrenheit okay so when rolling out the remaining of your dough place a little bit of more flour just to make sure that nothing sticks and your cookies form and come out easily okay so now we are ready to bake our cookies at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 to 12 minutes or when you notice that the edges are a light golden brown okay so our cookies are all baked and now I just wanted to share a few tips with you guys first thing is my cookies baked for exactly 12 minutes each tray another thing is you want to remove them from your baking pan after about five to seven minutes onto a cooling rack give them a little bit of time on the baking pan and another thing is you want to completely cool them off before placing your royal icing or whatever you are going to be icing them with now what I have here is some white royal icing that I have whipped up now the recipe is on my channel and I will give you all the tips and tricks that you need to know about that and what I have done here is I whipped up a batch and I placed one cup in a bowl and I added one teaspoon of water to thin it out of piping and then I also made some green here for our buttons of our gingerbread men and for about 3/4 cups of the icing I added 3/4 of a teaspoon of water so you want to make sure that you're pretty precise with adding the water because it might thin out your royal icing too much and you don't want it to be runny so that's that and now we are definitely ready to decorate our gingerbread men [Music] ok so these are just a few ideas of how to decorate your gingerbread man you can make them gingerbread girls you can decorate them whatever way that you like give them some skirts some pants some shorts whatever you want I just like to make them nice and simple but cute you can change the colors now if you make a mistake and some of your icing spreads you can just take a toothpick and gently go under and remove it and it will fix your icing so that's about it very very easy to make okay guys so these were a lot of fun and we are definitely ready to try one now it is ideal to allow the royal icing to set but I'm going to try one anyway they are simply delicious they have a slight crunch but a tender and soft Center they are so so good definitely better than any gingerbread cookie you will find at your local store or even bakery they are just wonderful okay so I just wanted to give you one last tip for the royal icing now if you're using your homemade royal icing and while you're decorating your tip becomes a little bit dry just take a wet paper towel and just clean it around every time you notice it gets dry and it will continue to work perfectly fine as long as you don't leave it for too too long well guys these were definitely a lot of fun to make I make them

[Applause] what's up everybody it is Marybeth ever sold the allergy actress and it is the holiday season which means it is cookie time I'm so excited to present the recipe that I have today it is a recipe that's been passed down from my grandmother on my mom's side to my mom and then to me and I of course have modified it for my allergies and I'm so excited about it we are making ginger molasses cookies today and I've kind of modified to also be a little bit like cut out cookies so I'm gonna show you how we made it we make it every season you know at my mom's house and then we're gonna do cut out ginger bread and ginger women cookies with macadamia nuts whoo let's get to the ingredients it's ingredient time okay we're going to talk about the in dry ice what we're going to talk about the dry ingredients first then you have the wet ingredients and then we have kind of the topper stuff for the cookies so we've got a gluten-free flour blend this one is made from garbanzo bean flour and has a little bit of brown rice and white rice in it tapioca starch and you don't have if if this flour blend does not work for you find one that does any gluten-free flour blend is going to work for these cookies so this is two and a quarter cups of that flour blend and then with the flour blend as you know in gluten four you usually have to have some kind of emulsifier you can use the anthem gum or I also like to use guar gum because guar gum is derived from beans xantham is from corn I can't really do corn so this is just half a teaspoon of where gum and that goes straight into that flour mix there then we are going to do baking soda not powder baking soda and that is two teaspoons of baking soda and then we're going to do our salt is all stuck again you know my favorite the Himalayan pink salt and that is going to be I think half a teaspoon oh sorry quarter teaspoon I have to look at my shoot shoot quarter teaspoon and then we have here is the half a teaspoon this is one of my favorite smells uh cloves it smells like holidays when you smell cloves if you ever get like a clove candle that just like one of the best smells a quarter or sorry half a teaspoon of that one then here is our ginger this is going to be one teaspoon of ginger and that's ground ginger all of this is ground okay and then another teaspoon of ground cinnamon mmm and you know cinnamon all right that's gonna be our dry ingredients and then over to our wet ingredients so we're going to have shortening no I can't do regular vegetable shortening so I have to get palm oil shortening and this is the brand that I use and you can find it anywhere really and you're gonna do 3/4 cup of basically room-temperature shortening and then here comes the sugar we're gonna do a cup of brown sugar and brown sugar is vegan so don't have to worry about that then we have 1 egg which is not vegan so sorry and that one is just 1 egg you want it to be close to room temperature so and then we're going to have a quarter cup of blackstrap molasses molasses does not smell the best on its own but boy does it make things taste good so anyway quarter cup of that and that's all the wet ingredients that go in the cookies then at the end before we bake we're going to put a macadamia nut in between the hands of the gingerbread man and the gingerbread lady and then you're going to put a drop of maple syrup on that macadamia nuts and then on top of that you're going to sprinkle cinnamon sugar which is sugar combined with cinnamon and you shake it together and it looks like looks like that so and that's really just to your liking so there's no real measurements there's just like how much will fit on the cookie so ok I think that's all the ingredients let's get to making this stuff [Music] time for the dry ingredients all you have to do is take your flour and you're gonna dump everything in so I always do the guar gum first just because I feel like that needs to it needs to mix well with the flour I always use a whisk to do my dry ingredients I feel like it kind of helps sift it through better and speaking of a sifter if you like to use sifter after you've mixed all the ingredients you can sift it once it kind of makes it a little bit more fine I don't usually do it for this recipe because these are pretty Hardy cookies but you know if this were like a macaroon or something I would say definitely sift the flour but this is okay okay so then we have our baking soda okay and I'm gonna go ahead and put the salt in there as well and we will stir it up stir stir I have such cool memories of making these cookies with my mother and my sister and of course my dad would taste test them but every holiday season these are some of the ones that we make and they're they're pretty easy to make so it was always like the ones that we pulled out you know towards the beginning of the season and then if we were like we need more cookies we'd make these so now I'm putting in all of the spices so cloves and the cinnamon and of course the ginger all right and these are some of the best smelling cookies is also good and they taste amazing they're not a gingerbread they are ginger molasses so they're a little bit more they're a little bit more um I guess chewy least I'd like to make them that way you can cook them longer and they become a little bit more snappy ginger snaps but I prefer the soft chewy because that's how we made them when I was a kid so okay so this is all mixed together you're gonna put this aside and you're gonna we're gonna pull the wet ingredients out put those in the mixer and then this goes in on the last step for the mixer right okay guys so I have just put the shortening in here for the wet ingredients you want to do this in kind of this order just because there it does affect the outcome of your cookie the density so you always want to start with your fat first so you're gonna go put that in there cream that go up really high and that's about all it takes to cream the shortening and then next thing we're gonna do is put all of the brown sugar in there so here comes the brown sugar and I always like to scrape down my sides a little bit just because with this particular mixer it comes up the sides a little bit and then the little handle thing doesn't like get it so so I always do this and actually my mom did that with her mixer also when I was little so it just must be a mixer thing okay so next is the brown sugar cream that too nice and it will look very grainy is the best way to say that sugary / well you see it sugar with a little bit of white basically okay so then we're gonna put in the IgG hi egg how are you okay that was at the highest speed that was 10 so this is the point where it starts to look a lot creamier which is nice and then we're now putting in the molasses molasses like slow as molasses it takes a long time to come out of whatever container it's in so we're gonna help it along with this little thing so speaking of Christmas cookies so I've got this cookie and then I've got like sugar cut out cookies I love to make and then we also I don't know if anyone knows this cookie but I'm sure you do sprit with the little cookie press thing and it's those little ones that are in the shape of like Christmas trees and stuff gosh I love those those are my sister's favorite cookie so hi sister hi Christy um looking forward to seeing you for the holidays and hopefully we'll get to make some spritz while we're there but I say I think this is probably my favorite cookie the sugar cut out cookies run a close second but this one I love I could like eat this I could eat just these okay so the last thing we're gonna do is mix that it's going to turn it like a dark brown my tables like wow and then here we have our dark brown see how it's nice and brown there and that is the time time to put in the dry ingredients when you add dry ingredients you don't want to just dump the whole thing because it will go up in your face so you want to add I usually add like half there we go and scrape down the sides again so that you're really making sure you're getting it mixed and get that side get that side okay who has a favorite Christmas Carol I have a ton I'm nice so mixes in mm-hmm there with the flower of the monster hands holiday monster hands okay I would say I don't know if I could pick a favorite Christmas song because I love so many of them I would say Silent Night is always one that I love the Christmas song chestnuts roasting on an open fire that one has a special place in my heart as does um have yourself a merry little Christmas Judy Garland you are my heart you're like my spirit animal um okay scraping down the sides one more time put the rest of the dry ingredients in and this is it for making the dough let's it's gonna get really thick just so you know your little mixer is gonna go so thick and that's okay don't go to the fast speed like instantly because your flour will just fly up in your face there we go now this dough doesn't ever really it's not a wet dough it's a very dry dough so I will pull it up so you can see it tada see how it's in pieces that's how it's supposed to be and then we're gonna put this we're going to cover it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for one hour and then we'll come back and we will roll out our gingerbread men and women and they will bake them and then we'll eat them it's time to do the roll out so we've got our dough I have put it on you can do it on a parchment paper or if you have a mat a Silpat mat that you can roll on that's the best and you put flour first so make sure it's gluten free flour I'm using brine Brown Brian Brian rice I'm using brown rice flour and I have put some flour on top as well as well as online little rolling pan and then you're going to roll it to about an eighth of an inch thick I like my cookies to be thick so um I go a little thicker than most people probably would although for gingerbread and ginger molasses you know I guess they do go thick for that so um but yeah we're gonna roll it out hey you stop sticking to the roller okay there we go and make it nice and thin not really thin keep it thick people keep it thick okay and we just need more flour on top don't we it's kind of humid here today so this is why we're having issues this is why baking is interesting when you're baking in different humidities I loved baking in Colorado because I never had the problem of like my my dough sticking to my rolling pin because it was dry so um so yeah there we go okay rolling it over Lunas we're gonna go this way and this way okay I think that's good I just want to do a few men and women to show you what it's like we'll do a row of each or we'll just how about that and then there we go and then there's a lady and then there's a gent and here's another lady and you just go until you fill it up and then um I told you I would show you the other way that I make these so let me tell you how to whoa hello oh he fell apart oh no guess what he'll go back together we news on the cookie sheet so when you get these you just scrape them away like this and then you get yourself a nice spatula to help you pick it up and put it on a cookie sheet and that is what we're gonna do [Music] okay so the other way that we make these cookies are the traditional way in my family which is to roll them into little balls and then you're gonna put them on here and then what you do is you'll get a little bit little tap of water and then we're gonna sprinkle cinnamon sugar over them now these do expand so you want to make sure you give space in between or else you will have linked together cookies which they taste just as good but if you want pretty cookies you got to space them out a little bit so I'm gonna finish rolling these up and then we're gonna go to the step where I show you how to do the macadamia nuts and the cinnamon sugar time to decorate okay so I'm going to show you how to do one of the gingerbread people and then I'm going to show you how to do the traditional ones so with the gingerbread people take a macadamia nut get the the round side sticking out like a little present and put it right in their chest and then roll the hands over not roll but like fold the hands over don't worry if it breaks on the arms cuz they'll actually cook back in and it's like they're carrying a little present and then you take just a little take the corner of your brush put a little drop of maple syrup and kind of brush it over the macadamia nut and there you go that's how you do that one and you also of course sprinkle it with a little bit of cinnamon sugar now for the traditionals what you do is you're gonna press the ball down get get two fingers in some water press the ball down just a little bit and this one also sprinkles with cinnamon sugar the water kind of helps the cinnamon sugar stay on the maple syrup helps on the gingerbread person I'm gonna finish decorating these and then we're going to pop those in the oven and then [Music] oh it's time to taste these gingerbread cookies or ginger molasses cookies as I like to say I'm going to taste the gentlemen hmm awesome perfectly baked let's get some of that um nut in there being macadamia nut mmm not really adds something to this cookie just adds another level I love it mmm well to all of you from me the allergy actress I wish you a very happy holiday until next time this is the allergy actress Mary Beth Eversole sign enough for now [Music]", "QY7mZ6EPwOI": "okay so i'm

occasion with the great territory bake off of 2020. i'm here to introduce you to some soft and chewy molasses cookies but first a little story of how we got to decide on this tasty dish when my southwest team texted me on day four of my crying eagle operation and my mind had been on chainsaws and chain breaks for the past four days i welcomed the challenge to think of a new dish um and distract my mind from what the chainsaws were and being in colorado and leaving colorado to go down to phoenix i thought of a tribute to the great colorado and it would be rocky mountain oysters however after sitting there googling for the remaining three nights in the creole fob i realized that rocky mountain oysters are not easy to come by at your local whole foods when i returned to colorado springs tried whole foods king supers and the local butcher shop does not quite just hand them over so unless you're willing to buy the hundred pounds of them through the bulk carrier they don't just sell them over the counter and so when i found myself late one night in downtown colorado springs in the back alleys talking to a guy named vito at the loading docks of the local butcher shop trying to find rocky mountain oysters and bartering over the price of u12 shrimp i figured it was easier to go with a soft and chewy tasty molasses cookies so that's how we arrived here so we have some set out already and they're sliding off already but pre-made balls here rolled up and dipped in some tasty sugar set on the pan this might be the easiest demonstration video that you see all day and i do have to give combo meds to my wonderful girlfriend who did most of the prep work for this and we're ready to go much tastier than rocky mountain oysters thanks everyone", "QeMgx_qy1MM": "well lord honey children welcome to the country bling cooking show honey it is wednesday night december the 16th i hope you all are having a wonderful wednesday here where we're at in kentucky we've

children we have talked about candy we've done two different because we've done a buds and then we done a peanut butter roll but tonight i want to talk about a cookie that's near and dear to my heart because you know christmas to me is all about the candies the cookies the pies the cakes and all that and i want to touch on a cookie tonight like i said that's near and dear to my heart it was my aunt jean's favorite and actually one of my favorites and it's a molasses crinkle cookie and honey it's one of those cookies that once you eat it for the first time honey child you'll want them every year at christmas it just invokes those christmas spices all those warm spices like the clove the ginger the cinnamon and then that rich molasses that we put in there so you're going to see that it's a very easy cookie most people think molasses cookies are very hard to do but they're not hard at all oh look i've got my favorite nutcracker towel out here tonight to use ain't he cute honey he's cuter than a bug and a rug honey on a winter night trying to get warm i'm telling you what i just love that somebody got that for me last year for the christmas and i just love it all right so i don't have miss lisa on the line tonight she had something that she couldn't uh be here tonight with us but if you have questions please ask them and when i watch the videos back i will try to answer as many as i can so don't forget you can get tonight's recipe on southerncountryblank.com it'll be on later tonight and you can get all the other great recipes from all of our other shows and all the great recipes that may have not been on shows right there on the website and don't forget you've still got plenty of time to get your orders in for your southern countrybling.com or southerncrunchblink.com lord honey child i crack myself up sometimes your southern country bling apparel so i think if you get your order in in the next couple days you still should get it in time for christmas and we're running out quickly and what's left honey that's all we got once she's gone she gone forever so all right so let's get into this cookie now i can remember having this cookie every year at christmas time my grandmother always made them it's a super simple cookie i've added one or two new ingredients to it just to kind of fun it up and jazz it up and make it new again so i thank you all are going to love this cookie so tonight we're making my molasses crinkle cookie now if you don't have molasses you can use golden syrup which is just a dark karo syrup you can even use like a mixture of like honey and dark uh karo syrup or you can use a maple syrup it would also work if you can't find molasses or don't like the molasses taste it'll be just a little bit different but they interchange the same so all right so now i'm going to have my assistant they're going to go to the microwave and they're going to heat up and melt the butter and the crisco that we got to have in this and we're going to talk about the the ingredients like i said there's not very many ingredients that goes in this cookie and i think you're going to love it so while we're heating up the butter and the crisco you just want to melt the butter and the crisco and you want to make sure that it's cool because if you put it in there and then put the egg in there honey child that egg will cook you'll have scrambled egg cookies is what you'll have honey child let me tell you so all right so i'm going to go ahead and crack my egg while we're waiting on that now this is one of them good farm fresh eggs that we raise right here you know like i've said many times as granny always called him she called him hand fruit and i just i always thought that was funny and i just like when she'd do that so put our eggshell over there and i'm gonna give you a little tip do you know that chickens will eat eggshells honey we give the shells right back to the chickens and what that does it makes a the egg shells on your other eggs they are more strong we feed our chickens oyster shells and that puts grit in their crawl so when they eat it grinds up their food a little bit better but it also gives them minerals to make the shells on the egg even stronger so there's your little egg tip tonight all right so now like i said molasses honey she's thick look at that this is black strap molasses there's two different kinds of molasses there's black strap and there's regular molasses i like to use the black strap because blackstrap has a stronger flavor to it and that way you get more of that molasses flavor to it now most of the time when we're using molasses we like to add just like a little bit of orange zest or lemon zest because molasses does have almost that little bit of like a copper penny taste to it but in this cookie it doesn't so all right so i have my melted butter oh lord children she's hot she's hot hot hot so i'm going to put my melted butter right in here now when my grandmother made this years ago she always used full-on crisco now if you don't like to use crisco you can use lard here or you could use bacon grease as well so we're just going to put our butter and our crisco right up in this bowl here and then we're going to add our sugar to it now you can do this recipe in the stand mixer you can do it by hand now i just have here white sugar and we add all that sugar get it all out of the bowl honey because you know you've got to have that sugar all right we're just going to mix that sugar and that butter together and that'll cool the butter down for us so that we're not cooking our egg now we're gonna add in our molasses now these molasses you'll notice that the black strap's not hardly as thick as the regular molasses and black stripe molasses is just pain uh it's made from sugar cane molasses is and the longer you cook the molasses the darker it gets and that's what we call blackstrap because it's been cooked a long time it's real dark we just want to mix that together with the butter and the sugar and get all the lumps out of there if there's any lumps if your crisco hasn't totally melted make sure that you just mix that up like that and get all them lumps out of there you know i love christmas time and you all know if you've watched my videos that of the all the decorations christmas is one of my favorite times of the year simply because which now i kind of do this year long christmas is one of those seasons that it changes people you know it we show more love during the christmas season and one way to show love is through homemade goodies people love a homemade cookie a loaf of bread like a banana bread or zucchini bread a pumpkin bread a cake uh some fudge or candy you know it makes them feel all warm and fuzzy inside and that's what christmas does it makes us feel all warm and fuzzy and i just think that this is the perfect time of year especially if you don't get time to bake through the year then christmas is the time that you really need to pull out the flyer and the bowls and honey get the bacon so all right now we've got that all mixed up now we're going to mix up our flour we're going to whisk it together most of the time you'll see recipes will say sifted i honey y'all see me enough now i say whisk it because it does the same thing as sifting and it takes a lot less time so i just have here all-purpose flour and then i'm going to add baking soda salt cloves cinnamon and ground ginger now if you don't like cloves you could use nutmeg here if you don't like the ginger or cloves just add a little bit more cinnamon but i like them all because that's those nice warm uh winter spices you know it gives you that feeling of almost a mold cider kind of like filling when you smell mold cider you know that that it's got cloves in it's got nutmeg it's got ginger it's got cinnamon in it and those warm spices is really what we want this time of year simply because they just go well with christmas so you know it's one of those things that christmas is off to me now it's all about the sweet treats and so i love my cookies i love my candies love my pies and um i just can't wait to show you know next week is christmas next week is christmas children it's almost here so uh you're gonna have to get in the kitchen and start making up some of these cookies all right so now that we have our flour and our spices all mixed together we're gonna come back to our sugar mixture and i'm gonna add in vanilla which that is a new addition to this because vanilla is not in the original and one egg now i'll tell you a good thing with this uh cookie recipe is you can double this and you'll uh be perfectly fine you know some recipes you can't hardly double because it won't come out right but now you can double this recipe and it does real good i usually double it simply because everybody loves them so good and that way i can just go ahead and have my dough made up and this dough if you don't bake it all at one time you can just keep in the refrigerator and pull it out whenever you want to so you just want to make sure that all that's mixed up good and you can see that i've got that all mixed up we want to add half of this fire mixture to our molasses butter egg mixture whatever you want to call that so half of that and we're just going to stir and fold and you can do like a figure eight in this to stir it up and you want to have a light hand with this because it's almost like stirring and folding but you want to have a light hand because any time you're working with fire if you get in there and beat that sucker up like that she'll be so tough honey you won't even be able to chew it so same thing with biscuits and we've talked about biscuits before you've got to have a light light ham with biscuits so all right so we're just going to mix that until we don't see any white streaks left oh you you might see a few white streaks left it's all right but it's really just a fold technique see i come around the side of the bowl and fold it back on it and then come down through the middle and you can see how well that's coming together so let's go ahead and add the rest of our flour in here get out there just like patting a baby's butt get on out there we need all that fire up in there all right we're just gonna finish this by mixing it together oh thank you all so much for the donations tonight to no kid hungry we've gotta donate two donations of uh all together of 200 tonight thank you guys so so much if you're watching this on the youtube channel or on facebook please go to nochildhungry.com and donate if you can thank you all so so much you know uh kids is one of my platforms i um i love working with kids i love teaching kids i love teaching anybody honey children how to cook but kids are our future and if we don't teach them now and while they're young to do things i just don't know where they might be honey when it comes when they get older so i'm all about teaching kids how to cook and bake and this the lessons of life as much as possible all right so now you can see that we've got that all folded up now you can tell see how loose that mixture is it just falls right off the spoon so once you get this mixture mixed up what you want to do is you want to put it in a bowl with a lid or you can just take the spoon out and wrap this bowl you want this to set in the refrigerator for at least an hour but you can allow it to set overnight now i have one that i mixed up earlier and it's right here and now you can see the texture of it it comes together almost like uh almost like pie crust so it's it's a thicker texture and this is what you're looking for so it goes from this it goes from this once you get it mixed up see how loose that is it goes from that to this and this is what we want this has already been chilled this has been set and actually this one i mixed up yesterday so this one's been in the refrigerator overnight oh lord let's wipe off her counter here let's get her all clean honey children all right so now comes the fun part now i have here a baking sheet that i've sprayed if you have a pat honey that's what you'd want to put on here a seal pack or a piece of wax paper or if your pan is sprayed it won't stick so you can either leave your pan like this and spray it or you can bake them on wax paper or you can use the steel pad all right now i have a little bit of white sugar and here you could use christmas sprinkles if you wanted to like sanding sugar like a red sanding sugar or green sanding sugar or even sprinkles like a nonpareil like we used a couple weeks ago no we didn't use the entrails on here that was on another show i didn't all right but you i just got regular old white sugar here and you just want to take a cookie scoop now there's several different kinds of cookie scoops this is a one ounce cookie scoop and uh he's got this cool little hand uh thing on it here so you can hang it up like that on a peg wall or something like that uh but this is a one ounce cookie scoop if you don't have a cookie scoop then you can use teaspoons and i'll get a couple right here and show you so you can just use teaspoons and also do the same thing if you're using a teaspoon you just want to get a little bit like this and you just want to rake it off into that sugar and then you just want to roll it around and coat that whole dough with sugar and then roll it in your hands and make a ball and then just place it on to the baking sheet that's what you want it to look like once it i wish you all could see the sparkle crystal on it that i'm getting from here this is so cool and then if you have a cookie scoop you would just take your cookie scoop and get you a nice flat scoop and you would go straight to the sugar and roll it around in the sugar make sure you get top bottom in size and then place it onto the cookie sheet now i'm going to show you this again with the cookie scoop if you're using a cookie scoop go and get enough and come up flat you want to make sure that you grab it and you pull it flat up to the side of the bowl and pull it off so that you get a nice flat scoop of cookie dough see that nice flat scoop of cookie dough and then when you push the thing to come out you'll have exactly what you're looking for and you just do that into the sugar and you just roll it around and make sure that you get all of its little sides dusted and you'll see on the finished product how crystal it looks almost like it's been frosted so and you just want to do that now you should get about 12 of these on a pan and you want them about two inches apart so i'm going to do that cookie scoop one more time and i'm going to do it against this way on the on the camera or toward the camera so you all can see and i just go flat to the side and then pull straight up and what that does is it cuts the dough off and then gives you that nice shape that nice perfect scoop and that way all your cookies will be identically the same now like i said if you're using the teaspoons you just want to get you a little bit of a ball against the side and rake it and then it'll look just like this so this is a spoon that we would eat like soup or whatever and this of course is a long handle teaspoon and then you just rake it into that sugar and you just coat it if you're using the teaspoons if you're just coating it then you just want to roll it in your hands until it makes a ball that's all you're looking for if you're using a cookie scoop obviously it's going to give you a ball that has a flat bottom to it or a flat butt it's kind of like me i got a flat butt so uh and then you just put the flat side on the paint all right so once you do that like i said you don't have to use all of your dough at one time you could bake like 12 of these and put the dough in the refrigerator in an airtight container and have the dough ready to go any time that you want it so once i get my cookies on or look here i've put everything in the world up on that tree children i'm telling you what ain't this thing i guess i was going to bake my spoon and scoops and everything all right so once you get all of your balls rolled in sugar and onto your baking sheet this goes into a 350 degree oven for eight minutes now make sure you set a timer because if these cook longer than eight minutes they're going to be more like a hard ginger snack cooking and that's not really fun to eat because you can crack your teeth on them suckers this you want to be a nice chewy middle to them and eight minutes is exactly what you need to bake these so once they go in the oven they bake for eight minutes and once they come out this is what they look like let's get the sugar off of here so i don't get that all over my so that's what that's what they look like let me show you so i hope that you all can catch that glitter i don't think the the cameras are picking up the glitter on the sugar but in person when you see these they're very frosty looking and that's what the sugar does and you'll notice when i break this open the how chewy they are look at that that's what you're looking for you want that middle of that cookie is very super chewy see that isn't that awesome oh my gosh [Music] that is so good you get those earthy spices from that cinnamon and then that little bit of clove in there and the ginger and the molasses that you get once you swallow that cookie i'm telling you guys this is the cookie you want to make for santa this year santa claus if you make these for santa claus let me tell you something i bet he'll stay in your house and won't go nowhere else because these will be so good he will want to eat them everyone i'm telling you honey now these are so good honey slap the elves and shake the glitter out of their boats you're gonna want a whole bunch of these because let me tell you they're good they real good a good cup of coffee and here's another thing you can make these into a sandwich cookie just put a little bit of buttercream in between there and you'd have the perfect sandwich cookie and i can tell you what buttercream i'd like with this a toasted marshmallow buttercream oh lord honey say it i'm so honest it's so good listen guys i know this is the cookie that you're gonna want to try the recipe will be up on southerncountrybling.com

wash your hands before you do a cooking project we are making fresh molasses spice cookies it's been a favorite since i learned to cook when i was two years old the main ingredients for a cookie are she butter egg baking soda sugar and flour but molasses spice cookies also include ground cloves ginger molasses and cinnamon here are some utensils that you need to use to make molasses cookies a bowl a pan a scooper if you have one but you but you can also use your fingers and for mixing you can use a spoon or a mixer or you can use the and you need to also use the oven and it helps from the ground up preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit or ask an adult to do it of softened butter add one cup of granulated sugar to the butter this is how smooth it will have the texture of popcorn one quarter cup of molasses and then you need to crack an egg into a bowl so you make sure not to get any eggshell into your mixture mix all the ingredients together add two cups of flour teaspoons with baking soda of each ground cinnamon cloves and ginger a shake of salt mix the dry ingredients before you add it to the wet ingredients mix the ingredients on low or you'll be wearing your ingredients it smells like spicy sugary molasses and and it smells so good i just want to eat it cook cookies on a lined or greased cookie sheet good job ramen yeah ask an adult to put the cookies in into the oven for 10 to 15 minutes after the after you take them out of the oven let them cool for two minutes then put them on the wired rack to cool completely with a nice glass of milk it tastes so good cinnamon lots of sweet sugary for joining us on board and girl make food you're watching me on this on my speech about freshly baked molasses cookies i hope you'll watch them on youtube and make them your own", "gUl78IcqyXU": "[Music] so hey we're going for a walk sea glass thank you hello you beautiful rebels in today's video we are just doing stuff so let's go sidewalk and all this wow wow that's a lot of sea glass whoa and then i have something else timber yellow pottery and then i have this are you eating a ball ball is it good these are peanut butter balls that i made yesterday with a bunch of good stuff in them like chia seeds and they have shredded coconut on top what are you having for breakfast yogurt and syrup good so we're going hiking in today's video but we are a bit pro occupied in the background of today's video and i just want to come off as really honest about that because uh we got scammed and so we have to deal with that today as well and um yeah just wanted to be really honest that does happen to people and it did happen to us and i will eventually make a sit-down video about this on my other channel i have another channel it's called fairly local life and i will link to that in the description of today's video but yeah i um that's going on in the background of today's video we're trying to focus on the positive today we're going to get outside we're going to be in nature it's going to be good but we have other stuff going on what you up to uh trying to file a police report sometimes buying second hand doesn't work out [Music] are you all ready to go for a walk in the woods [Music] yeah so we are just back from our walk and we're at home and i am going to be making molasses cookies now these are vegan molasses cookies and i do use gluten in this recipe this is not a gluten-free recipe so this is my organic molasses right here which is fair trade as well and it says right on the front of it source of calcium and iron so good stuff so i'm going to be using uh 1.5 pounds of molasses or roughly 662 grams and i'm gonna say this is probably i don't know about two cups maybe two cups and a half and i'm just gonna go with that that's how much i'm putting in this recipe today next up i'm adding roughly two cups of brown sugar i'm using brown sugar today because it's pretty cheap and i buy it in bulk but you can use any type of sugar in this recipe including coconut sugar or cane sugar or white sugar but i do suggest the brown sugar over white sugar personally just because it has a better taste for it in baking next i'm going to be adding one teaspoon of vanilla extract now i'm going to be adding about five teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice i'm also going to add like a little sprinkle of cinnamon as well as about a teaspoon no two teaspoons of ginger spice a little tiny bit of salt about two teaspoons of baking soda i like to add coconut oil so i add about two cups of coconut oil but you can use vegan butter for this recipe before the next step i like to mix all of this all together i forgot to turn on my lights so they are now on but anyways during this entire process you are going to want to turn on your stove at 350 fahrenheit and this smells so good smells so good so now we have all of that mixed together and now you're going to want to add in about i'd like to say about four cups four and a half cups of flour and when handling flour i like to do this i like to secure a bandana over my face just because i am very allergic to wheat products and if i touch it my hands will get red and itchy and i do have an epipen and i do not want this stuff in my lungs because i will have a bad reaction that way as well and also i have celiac disease so all around not good stuff we shouldn't have it in our home but we have it anyway because i try to be really careful and yeah so once all mixed up it should be looking like this really nice dough or batter right here for this part you are going to want a plate because you are going to use white sugar you're going to sprinkle it on your plate and then you're going to dust your cookies with it as you form them and i do not have white sugar it usually looks prettier on cookies i only have brown sugar on hand so i'm going to be using brown sugar today but you are just going to want to dust your cookies like this like so you really only have to dust one side i do both i don't know why with the same dough you can make gingerbread people um or gingerbread llamas or gingerbread dinosaurs whatever you really fancy with your fancy glasses and there you have it and now i'm going to be putting these in the oven and checking them intermittently it usually takes about i'd like to say about 10 to 12 minutes to bake them what you're looking for when baking is they're going to start cracking on the top and then you know they're ready all right the cookies are out of the oven and this is basically how you know they are done they start to get cracked on top as you can see you do not want to bake them longer because they will get black on the bottom and be really hard you want these to be chewy so you let them sit for about five minutes and then you can basically put them on a plate and there you have it chewy vegan molasses cookies and again these make great gingerbread people or gingerbread animals and you can definitely use this dough for that [Applause] what'd you find a fairy hat from a nut from acorn [Music] they look perfect and then there's a tree chair over here snack time in the woods do you have a peanut butter ball apples giant ones these are seconds apples so they might look imperfect but they're still good i have a king what's your favorite part about walking in the woods going hiking and singing fun singing the same thing with salsa this is the soup i'm making it is a lentil potato carrot soup very simple to make very filling very healthy for you all right this is lunch i'm eating out of a jar because all my bowls are in the washer and i have to wash them we just got back home from another walk and we are eating soup what do you think it's pretty good the yummy it's all good does that beat the pumpkin soup do you want to do the end of the video you want to say get dirty stay magical piece bye uh no thanks you want to say get dirty see magical piece get dirty stay magical peace wait which is the right way in this way yes no that's the okay way this is the offensive way i think so why is it offensive i don't know yeah bye the kid", "ZWrs-GqpO1w": "[Music] how Lopez I am back I know it's been

was so busy because we were touring all through Israel so it was so much fun and I am gonna try to show you guys some clips of some of the food that I tried but yeah it was so much fun but I'm glad to be back home and we're going to be making Christmas cookies gingerbread Christmas cookies Christmas tree cookies because I have this little cookie cutter here so we'll see how that turns out but anyways I am going to we're gonna go ahead and jump right into the video no need to waste time right I am so excited because I have been waiting all year to do Christmas videos and it's finally here I cannot believe it so we've got to jump on the grind and get as many Christmas recipes and as possible I'm gonna still try to keep them healthy for you all of them may not be oil free and all of that but they're still going to be healthy and alternative to the regular recipes that we usually have during this time of year that's just filled with so much sugar and butter and on stone which it is once a year so I can kind of understand why but we're still gonna make an attempt to make these traditional recipes a little bit healthier right so it's let's go ahead and get started that recipe today is gonna be oil and gluten free and dairy free so we're gonna start off with a flax egg now flax egg is just ground flax seed with some water so I'm gonna go ahead and just back into my bowl okay so what kind of flax egg in here kind of feel like I should be using my clear bowl so you guys can kind of see what I'm doing so let me trade our board really quick I'm on my date lady syrup left today so we're gonna be using that the last molasses but feel free to use molasses in this recipe it's you know it's the traditional ingredient that we put in Gingerbread right so doing some cashew butter which of course it's going to replace regular you know butter so we're just going to throw in the cashew butter don't worry I'll put all the measurements and everything at the bottom for you guys in the description box so don't worry about that we're gonna go ahead and throw in some vanilla extract there's no limit to vanilla extract guys you can do one to two teaspoons just kind of cream up so I'm creaming together the sugars and the cashew butter my camera cut off so I don't know how much footage I got but we're just creaming together the cashew butter the maple sugar that I put in here and then I put in some dates to serve instead of molasses you can use molasses but this is all I had and then we threw in some inaud extract now I'm going to go ahead and throw in the spices and as I said before my cashew butter is quite thick because this is a new kind that I'm using it's Justin's so I'm using a new kind of passion butter but if your cashew butters too thick just kind of new throw it in the microwave for a little bit and maybe get it softened so that the mixture will be a lot easier to work with but anyways let's go ahead and throw in the spices so we got ginger of course ginger of a gingerbread Christmas trees or cookies right so I'm gonna throw in some ginger a little something to work with there so I put in some cinnamon some ginger and we're gonna throw in turn that neck so we're just entering some nutmeg you don't have to throw in that bad guy are you kidding don't like this like like this like that that extra spice that's missing that you just you taste the dessert like something's missing that's nutmeg you can also throw nutmeg and savory dishes as well which I know it's kind of strange but then I'm just gonna throw in a little bit spice feels so good to get back into the grind of cooking I have not cooked any weeks I have not baked in peace I just been enjoying myself taking a break from the action but she'd always Christmastime it's time to get back in this kitchen seriously I might get a little bit of water to happen to this the cashew butter replaces butter fabulous I mean it's it's it's it's a wonderful replacement if you're not you know against a little bit of nuts it's just a wonderful replacement are you going to go ahead and add in the dry ingredients these cookies on the road right let me get some salt in there and taste the mixture if you feel like you want more cinnamon or ginger or whatever taste it adjust it to your taste buds and to your life so I'm gonna use this gluten-free flour which I already have most of it measured out here I'm gonna use between a cup and 1/4 to a cup and 3/4 so just whatever works until I get a consistency a dough that I'm comfortable with so let's go ahead and add in the baking agents I'm gonna add in some baking soda [Music] you want a nice dough that you can roll out and create these cookies southeast its gonna go ahead and spread this out I didn't know how a rolling pin that's really what I need for Christmas still only get hints kit I actually use a rolling pin I don't know why I don't I definitely could see how what do you guys want for Christmas I know that most of you guys watching or adults like hey it was always something that we need right socks socks are like one of the it's weird but it's like when people give me socks for Christmas I get really excited because all the ways misplacing my so like I always meet socks it's not to just one of those things that you always need if you're trying to think about a good gift for someone sauce you'll be surprised how happy they'll be when they open up the gift and they see some sauces you know things like hand lotion hand sanitizer those things all of those things too so just that my old Christmas tree just go to as many Christmas tree cookies as I came in with the dough the dough will probably be eating darker than most if we use molasses sorry got my oven preheated 350 you're gonna cook about 8 to 10 minutes and then it'll be done so here is a process so yeah it's kind of weird being in the kitchen again feeling my way around it getting myself together because I didn't really cook for Thanksgiving so I'm really just getting back into the garage [Music] you frigerators go over ice if you choose but seeing how thick and firm the snow is everything I don't see the knee is refrigerating it but you can refrigerate it okay so I just spend me the first batch of cookies these are our Christmas trees in the oven gave us extra of sugar you can sprinkle it over the top extra maple sugar in here but if you have some raw sugar or whatever you can sprinkle that over the top anyways these are going to go in the oven 350 about eight to ten minutes and then make the second batch work on making a second that you swap and then I'll see you guys in a little bit when the Christians pretty good [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's just the cutest little things I made some frosting out of some raw coconut butter but you can use the frosting is optional I don't even know if I'm going to end up using it on it maybe I'll put it on some of the cookies but really don't need frosting for these cookies in it then it's time for a taste test but I think what would be proper is that I tasted by the Christmas tree because this Christmas tree is so cute I want you guys to see it kind of a light in here I'm gonna start a fire so that it looks all cozy and Christmassy while we taste these cookies it's just like like the ideal Christmas atmosphere bodies Cameron okay alright I think I finally got it Oh camera tip got the cookies hmm wow these are good cookies I would say though using date sir makes them taste a little lighter so if you like that rich you know kind of heavier molasses taste you don't want to use molasses which I prefer molasses but they're still good and never would have thought like 20 years past I've never traded the molasses for anything else so using date servers pretty interesting so anyways guys I know this video was a little but I'm back and I hope to bring you guys more Christmas videos uh-huh I will see you guys again very soon and have a wonderful Christmas holiday and I hope you guys enjoy it listen to plenty of Christmas carols make plenty of Christmas cookies huh and I will see you again I was saying you guys you can't very soon I need to know [Music] chestnuts roasting on an open fire", "mDKWoSkAFD0": "[Music] so do you", "chYhCK8Uc64": "hi everyone welcome again to make your way kitchen on today's video I'm going to show you how to do a ginger cookie and this is a great autumn treat it's great actually all year round but especially fall in winter seasons and it's so easy to make this is actually my favorite ginger cookie molasses cookie whatever you want to call it recipe it's very easy to put together it's just a two-pole deal you have your dry and one one another and you mix it together and then you bake them off what you're going to need to do first is pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 165 degrees Celsius and I'm gonna be doing this in a stand mixer today you could use just your you could just use a bowl or whatever a handheld mixer spatula whatever you've got and so I'm gonna start by getting a spatula with which for some reason every time I always forget to have it so I've got butter that's soft adhere this a cup of butter and I actually overly soften this I don't even know that's really overly softened I put it in the microwave a little bit too long because I didn't take mine out in time anyway you just want it to be soft and butter and before I go ahead and mix that I'm just gonna get all my dry ingredients done right now so what I've got here is about a pound of flour and that's three cups one and one third cup plus another tablespoon or so and this is a white flour so it's you're gonna need a pound so what a flour and in this little container I've got the rest of my dry ingredients if there's cinnamon in here there's ginger there's all cloves there's baking soda I had a pinch of coffee powder a little more than a pinch but quarter teaspoon I just think it brings out some more flavors and so pretty much those are all the spices so the cinnamon ginger ginger all cloves baking soda coffee the espresso powder is they meant to say and we're gonna whisk that together and you just want it to be evenly combined there's also salt in here but all that will be on the website Baker Wacom there we go that should be good enough and this is our drive so just once it's fully incorporated that's pretty much all we need to do I mean you could get out a whole sieve and make sure there's no lumps and get it fully fully mixed through but I think just doing it that way is absolutely fun so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna beat the I'm gonna cream the butter just by itself for about a minute before adding in the sugar so I'll just be back in just a second all right so after about a minute or so your brother should be nice and creamy so you can break down the sides scrape down the side get back down it's very creamy now which is what we want so now I'm gonna add in my brown sugar you could use white sugar although I must say with a cookie I always enjoy with a ginger cookie I like to have use brown sugar because it's got the molasses in it so I just find it tastes better for this kind of cookie so now we're going to cream this the butter and the sugar for an additional two minutes all right so my butter and sugar mixture has been going for a while and it's developed as you can see a nice fluffy very fluffy light brown color and that's cut because of the brown sugar if you use white sugar it might not be this brown yet so now what we're gonna do is beat in an egg beat in our eggs one at a time before adding in our molasses we're going to need two eggs so I'm going to put this over medium speed and add eggs one at a time all right so once that's done scrape down your sides and we're gonna add in our molasses now one thing I forgot to do when I was measuring out my lot molasses was to grease my bowl anytime you work with molasses or anything sticky it's always advisable to spray down whatever your container you're using to measure it because it's going to make it a lot easier to measure out so you're going to need about 1/2 a cup of molasses and to me I know there's a lot of people out there that are not crazy about molasses I'm not on its own but in this cookie I'm telling you you need the molasses I know there's a lot of people that look for stuff that's like like ginger cookies without molasses but let me tell you it's just not the same really I know molasses can be strong for some people but it's pretty important in this recipe yeah so just try to get as much as you can because I didn't grease down my bowl it's hard for me to get everything I'll try getting the rest of it later so now we're gonna mix this just for another minute or so maybe lux just till it's all incorporated all right so now I'll just quickly straight down our Bowl alright so now we're gonna add in our flour mixture you could add it in all at once however I would recommend just doing it in segments so I'm going to probably do 1/3 to 1/4 of it and just start mixing and do this slowly as soon as it combines together immediately add the rest or immediately add another addition it will bind together very quickly the trick is to not let too much mixing happen but it really does help to make this recipe with a stand mixer because obviously we're working with a lot of flour so it's it makes the process a bit easier now sometimes I find especially if I've started with softened very light butter that is a little bit too soft I might need to add another tablespoon or two of flour that is yet to be determined so I'm just what I like to do is I bring the mixture TAS so that I can kind of get a sense of it so this part of it to do by hand and get this out of the way so you can see here this is our mixture and it is a little bit on the soft side so I'm going to go ahead and add about another tablespoon or two of flour and then I will show you the next step so now we're ready to put these in the ovens so I've got a large oven so I have a large sheet pan here but you can use a regular one and you can freeze some of the dough if you don't need it right away you can put it in the fridge right away if it's a little soft on the soft side but if you're ready you can go ahead take a cookie scoop two spoons whatever you got I'm going to use a cookie actually this is an ice cream scoop and it's about a quarter cup measure so I am making larger cookies this will make a large amount of cookies probably I'm gonna say 30 to 40 large cookies obviously depending all ice cream scoops are a little bit different in size I find I mean cookie scoops but if you just use a standard ice cream scoop that should work make sure to leave a few inches apart because these things will spread so it's very important that you leave lots of room between them now distributed all my cookies so now one thing you can do once you have them all done now for the size because I made mine huge I got two dozen cookies out of what I just made so now what we're going to do is you can just Pat it down a little bit it's going to spread it should spread if it's very soft just give it a light Pat each one and if you want you can sprinkle over the top some granulated or even better some raw sugar if you have some this stuff is completely optional I'm only going to do it for some of them because I feel like ginger cookies you're sweet enough they don't really need it but some people like the crunchy top so I will do it for some of them right anyway so I'm gonna put this whoa that one got a little much so I'm gonna put this in the oven for it woo or about I would say anywhere in the 15 15 18 minute range you're gonna you're looking for them to develop a golden brown color to to have set and I'll show you what they look like once they're done alright so I've now taken the cookies of the oven and this is what they look like once they're done as you can see they're very thin and long I really like cookies that way and they're very chewy I've already like almost eaten a whole one so I'll give it a try for you I'm telling you this recipe is so good you're gonna want to make these old-time obviously that wouldn't be a good idea but I highly recommend it these cookies the best parent you can have with them is milk 100% works every time these cookies can be stored in the freezer but if you're going to use them within a week just store them in an airtight container leave them at room temperature you can put them in the fridge if you prefer and they're just a great treat to have around you don't need to make up the entire batch you have if you if you don't want to and so they're great please visit Baker Raycom for

sugar crystal kitchen today I will be showing guys my take on a traditional Christmas tree gingerbread cookies these are super easy to whip up and make lovely homemade gifts for friends and family so let's get right into the recipe to begin in a stand mixer we're going to cream together one and a half sticks of softened unsalted butter and one cup of packed brown sugar until the mixture becomes pale and fluffy you have everything a good scrape to make sure everything gets incorporated and next we're just going to mix in our one egg along with 3/4 cup of molasses and to prevent the molasses from sticking to my measuring cup I usually like to spray it down with some cooking oil next up for the dry ingredients you're going to need four cups of flour two teaspoons of ground ginger one-and-a-half teaspoons of ground cinnamon one-and-a-half teaspoons of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon of salt now just add all of your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients and with your mixer on low speed mix until the dough comes together you don't want to over mix the dough or your cookies will become tough next just divide the dough in half and wrap each portion in plastic wrap let the dough chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before working with it after half an hour our dough is firm enough to work with flour your work surface dough and rolling pin to prevent it from sticking then roll out the dough to about an eighth of an inch in thickness and next you can use any cookie cutters you want I'm just going to be using my cute little bear cutters and some basic Christmas ones too and just make sure to dip your cookie cutters in flour when you use them so that the cookie shapes are easier to remove from the cutters [Music] transfer your cookies to a parchment lined baking sheet and we're just going to bake them off at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about eight to ten minutes that is it for these simply delicious and adorable gingerbread cookies you can always go the extra mile and decorate yours with some royal icing to make them extra cute but just remember to let the cookies cool completely before doing so also don't forget to stay tuned because I will

another episode with me living for you Ashley today we are making ginger molasses cookies now they are not just any ginger molasses cookies they are almond butter ginger molasses cookies I know when I first saw this recipe and saw that the main ingredient was almond butter I was very very curious and made them right away and they turned out amazing so then I was like all right gotta make this for a video and how I came upon this recipe was I was trying to figure out what to do for my next video and I was like okay I have almond butter in my fridge let's find a recipe that I can make with the almond butter so I went on Pinterest amazing Pinterest and I looked at almond butter recipes and of course I saw like the almond butter chocolate chip cookies and almond butter brownies and you know I kind of wanted something a little different so I kept scrolling and then I saw this almond butter ginger molasses cookie recipe and I knew I had to make it right away to see how they tasted and oh my goodness they are so good so the original recipe is from nourished by nutrition calm I have changed up the recipe a little bit so if you want to see the original recipe head to that link in the description but for now I guess we'll get started with ingredients so for ingredients today you need 3/4 cup of natural unsalted almond butter half a cup of coconut flour or almond flour so the original recipe does call for half a cup of almond flour however when I was recipe testing there's a recipe I only had coconut flour in my cupboard and they worked out perfectly so I'm sticking with coconut flour I also find it to be a little bit more accessible than almond flour and a little bit cheaper so totally up to you if you want to use coconut flour or almond flour 3 tablespoons of organic cane sugar quarter cup of molasses 1 flax egg which is 1 tablespoon of ground flax mixed with three tablespoons of water one teaspoon of baking soda one teaspoon of cinnamon 1 teaspoon of ginger 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt and a quarter cup of organic cane sugar for rolling you also need to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees you need two greased or lined baking sheets and you also need a stand mixer now if you don't have a stand mixer you can make them no problem by hand it'll just require a little bit of muscle when you're mixing it all right let's get started [Music] my Chloe am i right I mean who would have thought to put almond butter in ginger molasses cookies well nourished by nutrition figured that out oh thank you for sharing your recipe with all of us because man they are good oh you know what I think would be even more amazing is if you took two of the cookies and put in some vegan vanilla ice cream in the middle and made an ice cream sandwich out of it huh that would be amazing thank you again for watching another episode with me living free Ashley please subscribe to my channel and share my videos and Cheers to living free [Music] [Applause]", "tNnzts1uVco": "hey guys welcome to the bite my name is Jackie today's episode is going to feature a quintessential flavor for the holidays this is a chewy gingerbread cookie kind of like a ginger molasses cookie I have been loving this during the holidays and I've tested it quite a few times I finally come up with the perfect ratio of everything and it really works you guys are going to love it so let's go over the ingredients so I have butter and sugar some molasses a little bit of water 1 egg I'm gonna zest a little bit of this orange and in here I have all-purpose flour ginger powder cinnamon baking soda and this is pumpkin pie mix but if you don't have that you can totally use like nutmegs or close or just great you know those kind of fall flavors but ginger is in and also just worked fine oh they are so I'm gonna start first by combining all my wet ingredients starting with the butter and the sugar so if the cookie that I'm making that day is requiring softened butter or melted butter I will usually mix the butter and sugar together with my spatula and I'll switch to a whisk and plus it up and cream them together a little bit better that's just how I typically do it these are creamed together pretty well now I'm gonna add my water and my little bit of molasses so molasses is one of those ingredients that you don't want to overdo when I was testing this recipe I found that one citrus but really well and it kind of helps to brighten the flavor of the heavy molasses but also if you add too much they can almost make your product taste kind of barbecue sauce II so as long as you have the right amount of molasses you're good the gingerbread color is starting to develop you're not looking for it to develop more flavor you just kind of want to wake up those flavors [Music] that is good just [Music] fold it using your spatula to fold in your drink gradients will prevent you from over mixing which you could do a little bit easier with newest so the dough is pretty much combined I am just going to get these little bits of flour that are sticking to the bottom I'm gonna let the dough chill for about thirty minutes in the fridge and then I will meet you back here before you put them in the oven so the dough is chilled for about 20-30 minutes I'm gonna start putting them into little rounds so last one is ready what you could do is take each of these and roll them in you bake them I truly don't think it needs it but if you're like a textual person and kind of like that lunch by all means it'll turn out the stain it obeys the same way but I prefer to do it like this so I don't have enough room to make all this dough on one sheet I'm actually going to save the rest of it and freeze it earlier date these are going to go into an oven preheated at 375 for about 12 ish minutes be sure to leave a little bit of space in between each ball of dough they are gonna spread slightly so you go in and I'll meet you back here when I'm ready to eat them they just came out of the oven they're looking perfect you can see the little pricklies on top of them and the bottom is golden brown and when that happens you know that it's perfect they're gonna be nice and chewy in the center I'm ready it's everything you want in a gingerbread cookie it's still time drama inside it's chewy it's got the crisp edges and then nice texture on top like I mentioned you could totally recommend do some some sugar before you bake them or you can even finish the top of them with a little bit of powdered sugar and assess it over the top I'm good just like this did this is Constantine forget your avocado sauce it's all about gingerbread cookies during the holidays thank you guys so much for watching I hope you've enjoyed this and give you a try they're so easy

"welcome to bacon with mom calm I'm Susan and today we're going to make double ginger molasses cookies you start with softened salted butter we need one stick or a half a cup and we beat it at medium high we turn it down a bit so that we can add three quarters of a cup of brown sugar I scrape the sides so that I get the butter and sugar mixed in well now your brown sugar can be light or dark the darker the brown sugar the more molasses that's in it not to that we're adding one quarter of the cup of molasses yes more molasses I had to turn it off because I'm left-handed and it makes it a lot easier want to get all that yummy molasses in there because it's nice and spicy helps ass kicked our cookie now I break an egg and I'm going to add the egg white so we want to make sure we don't get any yolk in that's who I mixed it scrape the sides so that you get it all mixed well and now I'm going to add a teaspoon of ground cinnamon ground ginger and ground cloves and the quarter of a teaspoon of salt this adds a lot nicer spice to it also then i have here i have two cups of flour and 2 it is one-and-a-half teaspoons of baking soda we're going to add that to the mixture and it gradually so it doesn't who fall over he had it too quickly and it will pop up and be all over the place like the script assigns make sure the flowers mixed in thoroughly now comes the best part this is why it's called double ginger in here i have three quarters of a cup of crystallized ginger some people may not like it quite a spicy solo half a cup it be just fine but this is what really makes it good because when you take a bite you buy nice chunk of the ginger mix it in so that your ginger is throughout the batter otherwise some cookies will have all ginger and some won't and then we're going to put it in the refrigerator so let's see how these turned out nice and spicy those chunks of ginger just give it a little kick it's so good enjoy hi I'm Susan with big with mom calm subscribe

i'm going to go ahead and say that um my mixer is loud when it's like when it goes really fast so if you had if you have headphones on you might want to turn it down so it doesn't kill your ears but just want to keep your abs up heads up so i think we'll be i'll get started at 1 30 because i don't want to leave i pop something easy one more minute uh while we wait for some people and then we will get started [Music] okay it's 1 35 and we're gonna go ahead and get started um hopefully more people that i will join but yes we're gonna go ahead and get started so what you need to do is preheat your oven to 325 and um if you're doing the recipe with me if not then i guess you're just listening and watching so so this is really hard for the first time so um let's get we're gonna get started yes so if you have a electric mixer you're going to need a paddle attachment to it and you need to make sure your butter is softened because if it's not then it's going to take forever but it's not going to work well so i have one cup of softened butter that has been out since this morning it's pretty it's pretty um room temperature okay anyway you need a cup of butter one cup of brown sugar okay one cup of brown sugar one egg and vanilla and you need 1 4 cup of dark molasses or any type of molasses it works either way and molasses is really hard to get out so yeah you're gonna need a spoon but once you get most of it out try not to mess up the tablecloth so now okay now that we have our drop like our dough mix if i if that makes any sense before you put the flour in it and it becomes like hard dough so so we're gonna let this down i'm gonna let this down and i'm going to turn it up just so for headphone users just [Laughter] okay okay so you will mix it for as long until most of your butter clumps are out and everything else is mixed and you can't really tell that there was butter in there so yeah you just gotta watch out for your buttercups and make sure you have a spatula so you can like scrape down the sides and get it off the attachment so now it is time to add the flour so you're gonna need two and a half cups of flour and um i can put this in all at once then you're going to you're going to need um two teaspoons of baking soda one teaspoon of ginger one teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of salt and uh i don't know what this is called maybe uh maybe you know what it's called but it's like a clear thing that sits right here that keeps yeah that keeps the flower i think it's in the sink keeps the flower like like like that in your face so we're i'm just going to wait a couple minutes because i don't have it right now and i i don't want to get flour all over the place because i did this once without knowing that i had to clear things a clear shield and it got like all over and i had to like clean up multiple times because the flower would not go away um so it takes a lot for you to get flour out of places this is what it looks like if you don't know what it looks like let go see this you have to take the mixer off or the paddle attachment off and you just pull it up like that then you just stick this back on most likely i will have it if i make this again i will already have it on there so we wouldn't have to go through that whole process but we are today okay um so i'm gonna mix it again so have fun [Music] yes okay we're gonna do this now and as you can see it like this is why you need a spatula because i know you don't want to do this with your fingers yet just not yet that's for the rolling of the dough and other stuff but when you do this it's not going to be exactly what you like chocolate chip cookie dough or like other like any other dough that you have it's not going to be like that because it's a little bit sticky so our next step will help it not be so sticky and we can put it on a pan what so now it is right here and i am going to set this to the side so that i can oil the pans and then we can get started with the process of the demo so it's just gonna sit right there so you don't need a lot of oil for this um most of the most people have a non-stick thing so you don't have to oil it's like clear this plant you don't really stick it doesn't stick as much as you think when i bake stuff on it so but i still oil it anyway so i don't have to so now what you're going to need is 1 4 cup not teaspoon 1 4 cup of sugar and that's going to feel like right here [Music] so we're going to well i'm going to pick up some with my hands and roll it in the sugar and then place it on here most likely on this pan i can get um 12 on there and so hopefully i can get 12 again remove the sugar don't mind mother in the background he's trying to stay out the camera but it's not working it's not working not working so you go like that and most of the time you don't have to like add a whole bunch to it but if you want yours to be like super cut like covered in sugary then you can like overpower it with sugar but most most likely you won't because the cookie is already um sweet even though we didn't add that much sugar into it it's still pretty sweet so you probably wouldn't have to do that so while i'm doing this it's probably going to take like five minutes there's a question that came up how long should i mix i want you to so there um there's not an exact time i'd say for um like 30 seconds to a minute because it kind of depends on like what mixer you have because if you have a um hand like i have a stand mixer if you have an electric mixer um depending on what speed you put it on like i depend on that um speed then as long as the butter clumps are mostly out of it and you don't see like huge gigantic clumps of butter in it then you should be good to like move on to the next part of the recipe so how is everybody doing i haven't seen a lot of you lately it's good to um watch your [Music] so how's everybody doing um how's their weekend going since this is a saturday must be chilling or something i can't be still for a super long time i gotta do stuff because if i don't do stuff then i get super bored so baking soda taken out over there oh thanks it took me a little bit to find that music because i wanted to wanted it to be instrumental so that like you don't have to like try to listen to the words while listening to me talk and all that stuff but if you have any questions or you want to add like maybe educate me some more on this you are surely welcome to you don't make sure um so some people actually like will get something um some people will actually get a measuring stick or ruler or something to tell the difference between how much space but as long as they're far apart work because these don't get that big in the oven like they'll expand but they don't like touch each other so it's not gonna like like you they need to be spread out but they don't have to be like far apart where it's like oh you can only fit like five cookies on a tray well i can but i don't want to auntie l is here and she says hey girl hey surprisingly with your beautiful and talented still and madison scott loves the background music and tiana's going to try to make them at home with her with your recipe yeah you send me a picture if you do it i want to see how they look gorgeous and that is they first tray actually went by a lot faster than i thought it was [Music] but i hope you all are staying safe because and social distancing because i don't want any other people to pursue thank you aunt janine i miss y'all i wish i could hand a cookie out to every single one of you we would have enough anyway oh okay sorry that took me a minute to look forward okay um so my my dad is a he cooks a lot so before i start helping him cook things in the kitchen and then i went over to my nana's house his mother and she like baked a lot of stuff and i kind of fell in love with um just seeing how it would turn out and how it how it would taste because i had a huge sweet tooth so i would try to get i would try to get um as much sweets as i can so i guess bacon kind of like took that over for me but i don't get to eat at all and if you do do this recipe like your hands are gonna get dirty at first because when i first made this i hated the smell of molasses it was so hard for me to concentrate with the smell of molasses of these cookies it was so disturbing to me for some reason but now that i've made them for like i made them three times this is my fourth time making these um the smell doesn't bother me anymore but before it was and i couldn't stand it being on my hands oh yeah what's a cookie you haven't baked what what what happened you haven't baked yet i i haven't baked a red velvet cookie because i have a recipe for that and um i've been wanting to make it um just to try and see if anybody would want it um because i've made oatmeal cookies peanut butter cookies chocolate chip cookies chocolate cookies chocolate chocolate chip cookies snickerdoodle cookies molasses cookies think of the cookies that's it what made you think you wanted to start a baking business well first time be straight honest with you i wanted some money i was really um like i wanted a lot of things and my parents started saying no that i needed to get my own money by either doing chores or um just doing something that could raise money and um i think one of my first ideas was to start a lemonade stand like every kid to start a lemonade stand but then once i actually started baking with other people and by myself and actually getting good at it then um it kind of just was like oh i can do a baking business but this idea originally came up from last year have you ever thought about a brown sugar baking cookbook no i have not that's a really good idea that's a really good idea oh i've never thought about that that's a really good idea a guy was like ah um so um i am a band leader at my school and being a band leader i get to plan events for like i get to help plan events with my band teacher on stuff i wanted to like stuff that like ideas that we could do even though we're still like some kids probably won't go back to school like i'm not going back to school um some kids are and we came up with an idea in november like for thanksgiving um to have everyone make what they like to make at home it could be it doesn't have to be a sweet it can be like anything they like a drink or an appetizer or something like that and when then we would like come together at a park or something and just hang out and eat the food and stuff and maybe play some music so that was one of my ideas so i myself haven't um thought of my own cookbook but i have helped my teacher with the really big cookbook a really big band cookbook so this is the last cookie people yeah the last cookie how do i how do i make an order you have a list of what you make um i did have a list but then it kind of kept growing and then i stopped writing in it um as much so i i do have a list to be honest um i can post it on my instagram account and i take talk from people who are like and um like but most of the time i i think i can try anything because before i sell anything to you um i make it myself to try it and see if i do it wrong some really all right um so yeah i really can make anything or try to make something and then i wouldn't sell it to you once it turns it's good from what you have made so far which dessert was your favorite one to make to make or to eat because they'd probably be a little bit different if it wasn't eating but to make so to make um with the desserts i've made so far what was my favorite one to make be my my brownies my caramel filled brownies and i'm only saying it specifically as my caramel brownies because the recipe to do it like i can either make it like a basic brownie or i can make it a fudge brownie and still add the caramel in the middle um but if you think i have to like insert it like a cupcake no it's it's not exactly like that before i bake it the batter i put like half the bottom bottom caramel and then the other thing on top and then i make it and i think that was one of the first desserts i made other than my chocolate chip cookies and like everyone loved those too and yeah my chocolate chip cookies are pretty good too so if you want to order anything just just chat [Music] most of you don't live that far away can i have a wet napkin so the cookies are done but do not leave yet because these are going in the oven and so that you wouldn't have to wait 15 minutes for them to bake i made a batch this morning just to make sure that they turned out okay and um and yeah so you will be able to see what the cookie looks like after it comes out the oven oh when which right doesn't matter looks right no it doesn't well kind of kind of well let me put it this way if you want like your cookie to have like the crinkles in it like the it's like crap it looks cracked and looks really cool then you would put it on the top rack but if you kind of just want yours to like just like i haven't from the bottom rack because i did top and bottom the cookies i'm about to show you is from the bottom rack so you'll understand how it will turn out instead of cracked like like the good cookie looks like so i just wait right there everybody i'm gonna go wash my hands so that i can function because i hate sticky stuff [Music] [Music] [Music] so you saw the whole thing [Music] okay so i don't really know if you can see it my hands are clean so i can pick it up this is what the cookie would look like if it was on the bottom rack or middle rack anything below the top rack if that makes any sense this is what it will look like it's not going to have that beautiful cracking one but it is a very small cookie like it's a good sized cookie and my mother will be trying the cookie for cute people um so she can give you like the what it looks like but while we wait for her does anyone have any questions i want to place an order because there's a notepad so i can place an order for you guys because i would love to make orders and give you give you some good stuff [Music] [Music] so my mother yeah um you can try the cookie um something um some things i would recommend to you is um once the cookie cools like completely like you gotta let the cookie cool completely because if you like molasses then you can eat this cookie warm because if you eat this cookie warm then it's going to like taste like molasses so if you want the cool the cookie not to taste exactly like molasses then you need to let it cool completely which is like 30 minutes to an hour so you can just let it sit out and um yeah so i have my mom and my brother who decided to come downstairs too larry's gonna try a cookie my mom has tried it with buttered pecan ice cream like a cookie sandwich so you could put vanilla ice cream and vanilla ice cream in it um and if you've had my molasses cookies and you would like to give a rating you can go ahead and do that to give people the idea of what the cookie is going to be like or like what it's what it feels like stuff so tiana what would you like do we ship yes we will ship

you will get to see me pull them out the oven as you see my mother and my brother everyone [Music] [Music] yes they are done there they are this is 24 cookies and as you can see i think i made a couple of them too big so that's why they are stuck together for the people who make this though when you make it make sure you have a wrap or something out like that something out like that so you can put the cookies on once they cool from off from the pan a little bit because you don't want to move the cookies right away or they will break because they're still super hot so okay oh my gosh but

"FWC0cUZ39go": "Danny Fiore and I have been decorating cookies for years on our television shows and for the magazine yeah and some books too and today we want to show you some of the clever techniques for decorating cut out cookies I'm always trying to save some calories around the holidays so I baked these using Truvia baking blend you did I did it's 75% less calories than sugar and they taste pretty amazing so we're gonna decorate some gingerbread and we have Ariel I say yeah and life is sweet from sweet Danny be these are these wonderful instead of using a pastry bag in tips you just use these squeezable bottles which really do it makes it feel just like drawing it's so much easier to manage and much neater and so I just outline the shape and fill okay and then I'm gonna use a toothpick since these are smaller I'm gonna use a toothpick to spread out my icing and also pop any air bubbles oh I see that's nice and should I sprinkle some is this sparkly sugar sanding sugar it looks so pretty yes and I always give my cookie a shake shake after I'm done putting the icing down and that really evens it out and also if you any air bubble if you're doing a large area exactly yeah right so I am gonna add snaps and notice I'm working on a piece of paper you can work on a paper plate on a piece of malleable paper because then you can put the excess sugar right back in - yes the sugar is conserve our materials that way yes it's a really fun project to do with your family or with the children you know these look really cute Jenny and so simple but I like your other signature cookies these beautiful red Santa's yeah now talk about embellishments a little bit because people don't realize that that you can just go to a candy store or to a decorating store and find really great embellishments these little hearts for example those hearts are my favorite I mean they are just candy icing hearts and of course we have some draws here and one of the newer things I've been using or beads and they're made with sugar pure sugar they come in all colors and and I love doing cookie trees at the holidays and they look so beautiful on your feather tree that we have here so I just take them with holes that you just try to make the hole okay so before you bake you make the hole and and it's there yes and then a chill in the refrigerator and then bake it and the hole stays so yeah I mean we have some sparkle there the sanding sugar is a favorite I always just make sure that it's delicious really good embellishments that taste good and the cookies look as good as they taste", "kVmFP1a15Eo": "today I'm going to be making spiced raisin hermit bars and here are the ingredients that we need 2 cups of all-purpose flour 1 cup of packed brown sugar 3/4 of a cup of raisins 1/4 cup of molasses 1/2 cup of butter and I'm using unsalted butter 1 egg 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a teaspoon of cloves 2 teaspoons of cinnamon 2 teaspoons of ground ginger and 2 teaspoons of baking soda if you're using salted butter simply omit the salt so those are the ingredients so let's get started okay so our first step we've got our flour here and what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get my baking soda in there and my salt let's get all the salt in there we go and then all of our ground ginger our cinnamon and our little bit of ground cloves I'm only using a half a teaspoon in here because it is quite pungent and I don't want it to really overpower our little bar so there we go so that's our first step so just mix this up until it's well incorporated and that is step number one all right so our next step is to cream our butter and our sugar together so we'll get all of our butter into our Bowl and then all of our brown sugar there we go and I'll just start on slow here and I'll just start incorporating all of this so I'll just mix this for a minute or so and I'll be back in a minute hmm okay I've been mixing for about a minute or so the next thing we want to do is we want to add in our one egg I always crack it into a bowl first just to make sure that I don't get any shells because as I always say it's a lot easier to pull out a tiny shell out of your egg then looking forward in your mixture so let's get our egg in there and you don't have to do that you can crack it right in there if you're feeling really confident but for my videos that's what I do so we'll just get all of this really well incorporated so at this point I turned my mixer on a little bit faster and I really really want to get this creamed up the egg actually helps in the creaming process because it's loosening up the whole mixture so I'm gonna mix this for about two minutes so I'll just keep going at that and I'll be back in a minute so I've done my mixer on maximum now and you can see that it's really getting nice and airy and fluffy you can always tell because the color of your batter will actually get lighter in color and that's good and our next step is to add in our molasses so I've got my molasses here I'm just gonna get a little spatula to get it in I'll be back in a second all right so I'm gonna get all of our delicious molasses into here I don't want to waste any that's why I'm using a spatula a little tip to get your molasses out a little easier is you can take a cooking spray like Pam or any other cooking spray and you can just give your measuring cup a little bit of a spray and that will help get it out if you don't have a spatula there we go you can see I've done a pretty good job here there we go okay and now we'll just get all of this well incorporated there we go we're also going to be preheating our oven a little later on to 375 degrees Fahrenheit but I'm not going to do it at this point because once we finish the dough we aren't going to chill it so there's really no reason to get the oven going yet okay so now we're gonna add in all of our raisins and we'll just mix those in for a couple of seconds here we go okay so what I've done here I've just moved everything to a slightly larger bowl so that I have an easier time so our last step now is to take all of our flour and spices and just get that slowly incorporated so I'm going to get the mixer going again a little blender and we're just going to blend all of this in go so this is a really simple recipe you know it looks like there's a lot of ingredients but it's not too bad if you measure everything out in advance and you have it all ready like I did everything just is much much much much simpler so there we go just add it all in so I'll just finish mixing this up and I'll be back in a minute all right so that's nicely incorporated okay so what we're gonna do now is we're just going to chill our dough I just want to clean my beaters off here we go I'm gonna take the dough but I'm just gonna pull it together and I'm just gonna kill it right in this bowl for about a half an hour so that's good okay so we're just gonna cover that right now I wish you could smell this it is just mmm heavenly delicious the smell of the aroma of all of the spices and everything in there really really good so at this point here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pop this into the fridge for about a half an hour just so that it kills down a little bit and then once that's done I'll be back and we're gonna get to baking so I'll be back in a little bit okay so our dough has been resting for a good half an hour in the fridge I'm just gonna bring that out oh that smells so good so let's just get this all out of here and what we're gonna do is we're gonna split this into two pieces so I just want to get this accurate you know go just grab our little divider here and we'll just split this up that's about half and half okay and then we're gonna take this and we're going to roll it and if your dough is sticking you can just use a little bit of flour so that it doesn't and I want to do a little maybe about a foot long or so yeah that's good enough just like that okay I wanted to got here is I have a tray with some parchment paper on it I'm just gonna get the first log on here there we go okay and then we'll do the second one so I'll roll that one out it's coming apart a little bit that's the raisins inside if you're having a little bit of a problem you can get a little bit of flour just get it down just get a little roll so that's good just like that okay so I'm gonna get this one now onto our tray there we go I think I like the size of that one better so I may just give this one a little push just to make it a little bit fatter what's gonna happen while these are baking is they're gonna flatten out a little bit and they're gonna flatten out this way as well and I'm gonna bake these 375 degrees for about 20 minutes or so all right so at this point right now I'm gonna pop these in my oven I will let them bake and then I'm gonna let them cool down and then I'm gonna come back so into my 375 degree oven for about 20 minutes all right so here my spiced raisin hermit bars I bake them for 20 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit and I've let them completely cool and I'll just show you how easily they come off the parchment paper here there we go and they are ready to slice so let's get to that oh here we go so what I want to do it I'm you're just gonna cut off an inch now I'm gonna cut these so I don't know maybe an inch maybe two inches something like that right about there so there we go we want to make sure that everybody gets a nice little size bar there we go so just whatever size you like you want to make some you know thinner you could do that too there are no rules but I like them a little thicker just like that and these smell really really good there we go beautiful oh yeah those are good huh all right I'll just cut up the rest here we go this is a really really good recipe so I hope you try it out and if you do leave me some feedback lovely so we have quite a few here let's count them up there's three there's six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen well maybe 17 maybe 18 18 good pieces I'd say so there we go mmm I wish you could smell this so I'll just take it off of here so you can actually see it a little better the contrast is a little better with the light colored plastic here but there we go so that concludes this video these are my spice raisin hermit bars I hope you enjoyed it if you did

cookie so let's get started first things first pre-heat your oven at 350 degrees all right back to my handy dandy stand mixer I'm going to add my 3 sticks of softened butter or at least I'm trying to come home come on butter don't struggle with your butter like I am alright three sticks of butter done I'm going to mix this together also just so I could get enough room in my new mixer to add more so we're gonna add our sugars so a half a cup of brown sugar a half a cup of white sugar half a cup of brown sugar half a cup of regular sugar white sugar and then your half a cup of molasses alright

it in white sugar and then onto my cookie sheet it goes so these are gonna bake at 350 degrees for about 8 to 10 minutes so I just mash it down sugar tray again these are my favorite cookies ever so just like that smash it down and I'm gonna use 6 cookies to a tray and I will let you guys know how many big cookies this makes because my recipe shows that it makes 36 cookies but I know it's not gonna make 36 big cookies and one more in my oven 350 degrees 8 to 10 minutes because these are a big cookie you're gonna want to let them cool completely on the tray before removing them so keep that in mind because you need it to be a little bit harder to handle you need the cookie to be harder and able to handle it so I have 5 6 6 I'll let you guys know cuz there's still a bunch of cookie dough up so I want you guys know on this one how many more you're gonna have to do or how many more it makes big key wise so I'll show you in a minute alright you guys this is what they look like I hope you

Cookies. This is always a must make recipe during the holidays. Nothing says Christmas more than gingerbread cookies! To start you'll need 6 tablespoons of softened salted butter \nin the bowl of the mixer, and you'll need 1/4  cup of brown sugar. You want to cream this together. As written, this recipe makes about a dozen cookies \nbut it can easily be doubled or tripled. Next then you'll add in 1 egg and 1/3 cup of molasses. When measuring sticky ingredients like molasses, it always helps if you spray your little measuring cup with a little bit of nonstick cooking spray before you put the sticky stuff in it. Then you'll need 3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of ground allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves. And that's all of our gingerbread flavoring. You'll also need 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda \nand 1/4 teaspoon of salt and mix this all together. Stop and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as necessary \nto make sure that everything gets mixed in. Last add in 1 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour and mix it all together. You should end up with a nice thick dough. Then we're gonna lay out some plastic wrap. We'll scrape our dough out onto that plastic wrap \nand wrap it up tightly into a little ball. Then just pop this into the fridge for about an hour to harden up. Once your dough has firmed up you'll want to roll it out on a \nlightly floured surface until it's about 1/4 inch thick. Then you use a cookie cutter to cut out your cookies\nand of course I'm using a little gingerbread man. And then place your cookies onto either a silicon lined baking sheet \nor a parchment lined baking sheet. You can gather up all your scraps and re-roll it out \nso that it's 1/4-inch thick to get more cookies. Then we're going to bake these in a 350 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes Let them cool on the pan for 2 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Now if you want to decorate them you definitely can with royal icing. Just make sure that they are completely cooled before you try and decorate,  otherwise your gingerbread man's face will just melt away. Now royal icing does dry really quickly \nso I like to use these little bags of royal icing. They're a lot easier to work with than trying to make it all from scratch,\nbut you can definitely do that as well. Once you've had fun decorating them, \nwell, they're ready to eat! Even though it does seem a little cruel to just bite his head off, but here I go.... Mmm! The cookies are soft, they're delicious. These are definitely a winner! Thanks for watching!

clean and delicious chewy ginger cookies now these cookies are lightly sweetened and they have just the perfect amount of kick from the ginger so I think they are perfect for the holiday season now just a little side note here in the clean and delicious community I get a lot of requests for vegan recipes so when I was working on this recipe I was very mindful to keep it 100% plant-based but then just out of curiosity I did a poll over in the community page just to see what you guys were wanting and I was shocked that over 50% of you actually requested that the cookie recipe actually be either low carb or keto friendly who knew I did not know this so here's what I'm doing here in the video today I'm going to be sharing the vegan version of the recipe and then I'm gonna leave a link down in the description box below if you click that link I will deliver a bonus recipe right to your inbox with the keto friendly low-carb version of the chewy ginger cookie and I promise you both versions are absolutely delicious ok so give me a big thumbs up if this plan of action works for you and if you are not already sharing your thoughts and ideas and comments and feedback with me please do that either down in the comment section below or on the community page because I truly am always listening and I really want to make sure that I'm getting to you the content that you're wanting the most ok so now that we are clear on that let's get started I've got my oven preheating to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and here I have a rimmed baking sheet lined with some parchment paper you could also use a Silpat app we just don't want our cookies to stick then into a nice big bowl I'm just gonna sift all of my ingredients together starting with 2 cups of white whole wheat flour now remember white whole wheat flour is still a 100% whole grain it's just that the wheat color is different so it creates a lighter softer flour and I find whenever you're doing any type of baking white whole wheat flour creates a much lighter less dense and product than if you were using traditional whole wheat flour so just a little FFT food-for-thought then I have 2 teaspoons of baking soda one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon 1 and a half tea of ground ginger and just a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt give that a shake work that through your sifter make sure everything is well incorporated then we'll move that aside and into another nice big bowl I'm gonna combine all of my wet ingredients starting with two thirds of a cup of coconut oil now you want the coconut oil to be at room temperature so you want it to be solid but soft if you lived in a very hot climate you could put it in the fridge for a little bit to harden it up a bit but basically you want it to be the texture of like softened butter and FYI if the vegan thing is not a priority for you you could certainly sub in some softened butter here then to that I'm adding a 3/4 cup of turbinado sugar that's also sometimes called the sugar in the raw and one Chia or flax eggs and for that all you have to do remember is take one tablespoon of ground-up flaxseed or ground-up chia seeds mix it with three tablespoons of water and then just let it sit for about 10 minutes until it thickens up and then my dear friend you have yourself a plant-based substitute for an egg that will work brilliantly in a dish like this one okay then I have a quarter cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk a quarter cup of molasses and then for my secret ingredient I'm gonna add in one tablespoon of fresh ground ginger as well so we're gonna be hitting that ginger from two different sides it gives the cookies a great little boost of flavor then using a hand mixer I'm gonna blend all of the ingredients together until they're well combined and make sure that you start out on a low speed so things don't get too messy for you and then you could just work your way up a bit once you've got everything well incorporated we're going to slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients so I do a little bit out of time a little goes in stir it up a little goes in blend it up until you have all of the dry ingredients worked into the wet ingredients and you end up with a nice thick batter like I have here then to form the cookies I just scoop up about a tablespoon of the dough and then I roll it between my palms into a ball just like this and then I slightly flatten it down I get a bit so it kind of looks like a thick disc get that on the cooking sheet that looks perfect and then repeat until you have 12 cookies on your baking tray and then completely optional but absolutely beautiful and insanely delicious I like to take a little extra pinch of the turbinado sugar and sprinkle it right over the center of each cookie the turbinado sugar has the bigger granules like you can see here and they really Sparkle when the cookies are cooked up so I just love how it gives a little extra holiday Flair and it makes the cookies feel super special then into the oven they go for 10 minutes or until they're set through and your kitchen smells absolutely delicious and then what I like to do is I let them cool down just a little bit transfer them onto a cooling rack and then do the next batch of cookies and repeat until you've worked your way through all of the dough you should end up with 32 cookies if you don't eat too much of the batter along the way because I don't know if you know this but vegan batter is perfectly safe to eat hashtag OMG mmm chewy warm spice perfection if you guys love a ginger cookie you will love this recipe now once all of my cookies have completely cooled I like to store them in an airtight container right in my fridge where they will happily last up to 10 days but if you wanted them to go a little bit longer if you want to say do your baking ahead of time you could certainly put them in the freezer and they will happily last in there for up to two months so you can make them ahead and then even use them as holiday gifts throughout the season and one more friendly reminder for those of you who are wanting the low-carb green free keto friendly version of this recipe all you have to

make oatmeal cookies they just use the recipe on the back of the canister that's right because if anyone should know how to make a great oatmeal cookie it's the folks who make the oats but that iconic recipe has some issues the cookies have a very cakey texture and almost no oatmeal flavor to speak of mm-hmm so we decided to give this recipe a well-needed makeover we wanted a chewy cookie with serious oat flavor and it starts with using the right oats so here we have old-fashioned rolled oats and that's the classic oat you use in an oat cookie however we've seen some recipes that use quick and instant notes but this is a no-no these oats have been Park cooked and then read dried and they have almost no flavor and their texture is really sticky almost like wallpaper paste okay so these are out honestly you don't want to use steel cut oats this is not for cookies this is for a bowl of porridge in the morning a big thick strapping bowl of you'd know about that one so here we have 3 cups of old-fashioned rolled oats and that's the same as you'll see on the back of the canister so no changes yet all right now let's look at the dry ingredients here we have 1 cup of all-purpose flour that's a slight change the recipe on the caster has a little more flour but by reducing the flour and leaving the oat amount the same you're gonna get more goat flavor to this we're gonna add a little salt this is three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a little baking soda that's the leavener this is half a teaspoon of baking soda and that's also a little bit less it's gonna make those cookies a little less cakey okay we don't want puffy cookies no you know that back of the canister box it made a really cakey cookie on the inside with crisp edges but as soon as that cookie cooled it sort of had a uniform texture that was just stale we want crisp edges chewy Center gotcha and another way that we get a nice chewy Center with crisp edges is looking at the type of fat now that well-known recipe uses 20 tablespoons of butter which adds a lot of flavor almost too much covering up that oat flavor but also it makes the cookie too cakey so we reduced it down to just 4 tablespoons of butter and half a cup of vegetable oil now what this is doing is this is inverting the ratio of saturated fat to unsaturated fat which again leads to a chewy or Center and that's what we're after so when you use a liquid oil like this you're talking about a bowl cookie so no standing mixer needed in order to get this butter in there we're gonna have to melt it so this is four tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium high heat while we're melting it we might as well Brown it because that really helps the flavor shine through so we're gonna cook this for a minute or two after it starts to melt until you get that nice golden color now I imagine since we're stirring everything together we're not using an electric mixer that also helps prevent a cakey cookie because we're not beating any air into it that's right so I love this simpler and better community so this is another time when you want to walk away because that butter could go from brown burned like that I also like to swirl the pan here there's something to do but it also helps Brown the butter a bit more evenly oh there she goes oh that's not so good yeah we're gonna go right into a bowl all right so into the hot butter we're gonna add our spices and our spices is just this lowly bit of cinnamon just a quarter teaspoon and this is a market difference from that recipe we've been talking about that had nutmeg in a ton of cinnamon we found it really just tastes like a spice cookie not like an oatmeal cookie so just a little bit of cinnamon does a job that's my song yeah and by adding it to the butter you're really blooming its flavor all right to this we're gonna add our oil and this again this is half a cup of vegetable oil we're gonna add our sugars now two types of sugars brown sugar and white sugar that combo adds good flavor and crisp edges so this is three quarters of a cup brown sugar 1/2 cup of white sugar let's stir this together I love Bowl cookies they're just so easy to make I don't even bake him the dough I've been known to do that that's where you mix it in a bowl preserves one all right now we're gonna add the eggs now the original recipe had one egg but we added an extra yolk and adds richness without being greasy so one egg and one yolk last but not least a little bit of vanilla this is a teaspoon between the brown sugar the brown butter and that little bit of vanilla oh yes oh yeah all right now we're gonna add our flour mixture now this dough is gonna get very thick and that's good because I think a lot of oatmeal dough's they add too much liquid thinking that the oats need that and that makes a cakey texture you want a stiff dough so it stays nice and crisp all right last but not least our three cups of old-fashioned oats and the most controversial ingredient in this whole cookie the raisins this is half of raisin you're not a fan of the reasons I am actually a fan of the reasons but just half a cup is all we're going to add they're optional I'm opting them in here I'm sorry that's all right I'm gonna make you like them mm-hmm I have no choice you don't have any choice so you can see how thick this dough is all right so switch over to a spatula and really just make sure everything's all incorporated here now it probably would have been easier to stir if you hadn't added the raisins all right I think we're pretty well incorporated so I have some baking sheet set up over there if you wouldn't mind thank you and they're lined of course with parchment paper now we're just gonna portion these cookies out and you want about three tablespoons of dough per cookie I'm gonna use a handy dandy scoop that measures pretty much three tablespoons of dough there's just so great to have on hand mm-hmm and I'm gonna push them all out and then if there's any dough left over I'll go back and add little bits to the whatever cookies look like they need it Jo left over here's our last cookie there all right now before we put these in the oven want to flatten the cookies a little bit because this dough is so thick those cookies won't spread right on their own so we're gonna give them a head start and the key to doing that is wet hands cuz this dough is very sticky so with wet hands I'm just gonna press each cookie tell us about two and a half inches in diameter I like to do one and then measure it see ya on the nose so that's your template that's my template all right so that tray looks perfect and as usual we're gonna bake these one tray at a time that way they bake evenly all the way through we're gonna bake them at 375 degrees for about ten minutes of tray until they're set around the edges but still nice and chewy in the middle Oh smell that I do I do I do hmm now knowing when these cookies are done baking can be a little tricky because they don't get a ton of color you can see they're just starting to get golden around the edges and but the center looks underdone and that's perfect that's how you get a chewy Center and also if you kind of touch it on the side you can see that edges are just starting to set so that's perfection okay so we're gonna let these cookies sit on this hot tray for about five minutes they're gonna continue to bake through a little bit and set up then we're gonna transfer them to a wire rack and let them cool completely all right in the meantime I'm gonna throw this second batch in the oven alright so here are two batches of cookies and they're ready to eat just no more waiting oh look at that nice and chewy in the center mmm very crisp around the edges mm-hmm it really does have an almost a toffee like taste but I can get those oats in there it tastes like toasted oats that's right I have a really complex flavor thanks to that brown butter and a little bit of cinnamon you know is not overpowering most the time when I eat cookies it's like a spice cookie with a little bit of oats in mm-hmm you definitely switch the equation that's oats first cinnamon takes a backseat finally an oatmeal cookie recipe that lets the oatmeal sign to make these at home start by using a combination of vegetable oil and butter and Brown that butter to deepen its flavor reduce the spices down to just a smidge of cinnamon and use both granulated sugar and brown sugar for a toffee to like taste mix the cookie dough by hand during an old-fashioned oats and raisins just before baking and there you have it from our Test Kitchen to your kitchen the most excellent the most OD oatmeal cookies oatmeal mokou taste is that what you owe to you Mike okay thanks for watching

baking i don't know i've just been super busy with work and then who knows what else but ty's just getting away from me so is it the second week or i guess we just finished the first week no it's like the 12th so it's the second week and i don't know when this is going to post so it might be later than the 12th you know but uh it's saturday today and it's a little windy outside it's 50 degrees which is kind of cold for us and so i am in the baking mood and so today i'm going to be making some ginger snap cookies okay this is one of my son's favorite cookies so i'm probably going to make these and then take them over to him he lives about 30 miles away so i'm going to see if he's coming this way if he is he could go pick them up so anyways i've had this recipe forever and 10 years i don't even know where i got it i don't know if it was my mother's recipe my grandmother's recipe if i stumbled upon it or what but i am gonna make it it's wonderful every time i make it so let's get started okay first thing off the bat is they want three quarters of a cup of butter softened so it's got to be room temperature if you use just margarine that's fine i don't like to use margin on a normal basis but i do use it when i bake these sometimes because it is a lot less money so i have three quarters of a cup of um softened margarine here in my agnes bowl and now we are going to add to that two cups of granulated sugar yeah i haven't even gone through near the sugar that i normally do because i haven't been baking that much so here's one cup and here is the second all right and i used to at christmas time i would make oh geez write 10 different varieties of cookies and make platters for everybody but you know honestly this year i'm not going to do that because with all this that's going on in the world i don't know some people might be hesitant to eat things from other people's homes so this year i'm just going to make little platters for my sons maybe for my work for the people that i'm in contact with all the time so we have our three-quarters cup of softened butter and our two cups of granulated sugar mixing now and to that we are going to add two eggs i use the large eggs that's the best situation for this one there is one and here is two eggs all right i don't know if i'm going to do any more baking tonight i think i probably am i think i'm going to make some chocolate crinkle cookie dough because we have to leave that in the refrigerator for a couple hours i leave it overnight i think i'm actually going to start some of that as well because my other son is coming over tomorrow with jackson my grandson and we're going to make some mornings together we're not going to video take that because he's three and my son doesn't want him on youtube and that's fine okay now we're going to add a half of a cup of molasses i have the grandma's molasses the original and it works just fine we're going to use a half and you really you can't skip on this you can't use something else you really really do have to use the molasses okay because that's what makes the ginger cookies taste so yummy i've been watching the baking challenge cook off or whatever on the food network it always gets me in the spirit of baking i think i missed the british fake off darn it said that it was in november so i missed it i don't have netflix i could see if i can get an on-demand tv not sure all right so here is our half of a cup of molasses don't let that start to mix in there i will try to remember to put this recipe in the description box below for you i'm not one of those to hide my recipes if it's a recipe that's mine i'll share it with you guys until i have a cookbook of my own and then you can buy it but that might be a while but i do want to do that one day so make one more quick all right we are going to add two teaspoons of vinegar i have here the white distilled vinegar you can use the apple cider vinegar which whatever one you have on hand [Applause] there is one and there's two all right good deal okay now we're going to add two to three teaspoons of ginger i'm gonna add three because i do like the taste of ginger i know i made these for the fair i think maybe it was i don't know what it was they said i had too much ginger in there but you know what that means it's all somebody's opinion because a judge is just an opinion but i still like to take my stuff to the fair it's fun okay so there's three teaspoons of ginger one and a half teaspoons of baking soda so there's one here and a half a teaspoon of cinnamon it's a brand new jar i haven't even opened it up yet half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of cloves now cloves is one of those you kind of want to follow what they say because it can be a little overwhelming if you have too much cloves in there i do love the smell of cloves remember i don't think there's popular right now but remember the close cigarettes i never have smoked in my life but i love the smell when somebody is smoking clove cigarettes i don't know might be crazy but i like it all right and now we are going to add three and three quarters cup of flour so we're going to stop agnes from turning around here and i always take my knife and even it out so you got one exact cup here there's one two three and three quarters so we'll use a half and a quarter these make the house smell so good it definitely smells like christmas when you're baking ginger snaps this dough would probably not be good for a gingerbread house because it's a softer dough so it wouldn't work on a gingerbread house no i honestly have never made a homemade gingerbread house and i sure would like to try it one day i have lots of aspirations of things i want to do you know all right we're going to let that mix up really nice it all blended super well it's becoming a thick batter let that keep mixing and we are going to get our pan ready so we're going to take our first pan spray it down with some nonstick spray i've got my wonderful little handy daddy measuring scooper here i love it because it makes the cookies all the exact same size those bakers on the um food network man they have to really that would be my hardest part is that they don't give them a whole lot of time and then they don't know what they're making until right then and there i'm not very good at stuff like that all right take this off trying to get some of this cookie dough off of here how many of you had fresh hot uh fresh baked gingerbread cookies right out of the oven but there's nothing you'll never eat another boxed gingerbread cookie again if you have them like this because they're so much different the ones you get in the box they're hard and these are soft and chewy they're wonderful all right so here we are we're just going to scoop up our little scooper and put it onto our baking dish we're going to bake these at 350 degrees my oven is already preheated it had a little bit of cheese that had melted off of my scalloped potatoes on the bottom and i could smell it kind of burning like oh but it kind of burns itself off you know but anyways we're going to bake these at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes i'll check them after 10 minutes and if they're not quite done we'll put them in for another two minutes and then we'll come back and i'll show you these beautiful cookies and how they crinkle and look so gorgeous when they're all done okay so i'll see you in a minute all right here we are with a plate full of fresh warm ginger snap cookies as you see with that little scooper that i have it makes them all come out about the same size we have a little crinkle here they're nice and moist and delicious so i will put the recipe in the description box below so you can try them out if you try them out let me know let me know how you like them these are wonderful i'm going to be making some chocolate crinkle cookies next for uh one of my other sons and i think i'll take my one and only neighbor over a few cookies there's five of them over there so i can give them some ginger snaps and some chocolate crinkle so stay tuned for another day and another baking video see you guys later bye [Music] you", "wv0KFerA-ak": "hi I'm Anna Olson and I'm so glad you've joined me here because guess what I'm making right here on Oh YUM it's cookie time I make dozens and dozens of cookies over the holiday season and this has become actually a new favorite you have not seen this anywhere before it is my gingerbread crinkle cookies so let me get right into the cookie recipe which is easy enough to mix by hand it's a classic drop cookie style and crinkle cookies have always been a part of my holiday tradition I think chocolate crinkles are probably the most familiar and they get their name because they have that crackle the icing sugar on the surface that reveals through the cracks the chocolate underneath and I thought why stick just the chocolate when you could make a gingerbread version so I've got 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter here softened to room temperature and I'm going to add to that a cup of light brown sugar you'll see all the measurements the full recipe is below in the description and for those of you who don't use volume measurements cups teaspoons etc you'll also see the weighted equivalent so really however you like to measure your ingredients I've got you covered I'm just creaming the butter and sugar together this is an important step because the friction of the sugar granules with the butter actually aerates the butter and this helps develop structure in your cookie so it holds together okay this is really important if you're making holiday shortbread if you ever make the same recipe year over a year and yet you see it varies well it could be just this simple step of beating your butter and sugar together it's time to add my 1 egg and I make sure my egg is at room temperature I always use my butter as my guide to tell me what temperature my other ingredients should be so for recipe calls for room-temperature butter then your eggs should be at room temperature simply because they incorporate better together if they're at a like temperature like this in I mean this is standard cookie stuff a chocolate-chip cookie starts virtually the same way but as we move along you'll see the add-ons that really give this a gingerbread character including half a cup of fancy molasses blackstrap molasses is the stronger darker molasses that's better for bread making it's a little bit bitter fancy molasses is a little lighter and typically the molasses you use in any gingerbread whether it's a cake a cutout cookie or this style of drop cookie and now I'm ready to sift my dry ingredients I've got two and a half cups of all-purpose flour and here in my dish I've already measured my two teaspoons of ginger teaspoon and a half of cinnamon half a teaspoon of baking soda as well as a quarter teaspoon of clove and salt [Music] mmm immediately you can smell that combination of the spices that just tells you this is gingerbread this is definitely one of those recipes that makes house smell incredible all right now I've got a nice batter here but one more ingredient to add and this is a bit of a funny story when I was first playing with this recipe I was madly putting ingredients together and then I looked down and realized I still had half a cup of granulated sugar that I forgot to add at the beginning so I thought well I'm not gonna throw the batter away and start again so I added it at the very end and didn't I discover that by doing this I get a better crinkle out of my gingerbread crinkle cookie that real profile between the earthy Brown gingerbread cookie and the white icing sugar showed through even better so now it's part of the recipe I also find I get a chewy R cookie by adding this little bit of sugar right at the end I think it's because the sugar doesn't dissolve until it hits the heat of the oven it's not guarantees it stays nice and chewy okay now I'm ready to portion my cookies I've got my baking tray ready lined with parchment it really is the only way to bake cookies you can reuse the parchment but it's easier to clean your tray and then you don't have to grease it every time you make a batch I use a scoop and portion my cookies and I have here a bowl of sifted icing sugar I'll just drop the scoops right in and you want to give your cookies a generous tumble in the icing sugar make sure they're coated and then coated some more you want to leave a couple inches space between the cookies so they have room to spread when it comes to making this recipe ahead what I like to do is actually scoop the batter like this but I don't roll it in the icing sugar then I put them on a tray close together is fine and I chill or freeze them for an hour that way then I can pack them into a container or a resealable bag and pull out a few as I need them I let them thaw on a baking tray roll them in the icing sugar and pop them in the oven that way you can have freshly baked cookies whenever you want but all the works been done ahead of time all right now I've got a full tray here so before I pop them in the oven I just quickly flatten them down the palm of my hand and now they can go into a 325 oven and guess what they only take 10 minutes to bake they're fun to watch because they collapse expand crinkle pop up then I have one last trick that really keeps these gingerbread crinkle cookies nice and soft in the center the last move to guarantee I have a chewy gingerbread crinkle cookie is to give the whole pan a smack on the counter right out of the oven see how they immediately collapsed now I'll move them over to my cooling rack and I give them just 5 minutes to set on the tray because otherwise they would actually break they're so soft right now but in five minutes I can lift them from the tray to the cooling rack to cool completely okay let's be serious not quite completely I need to try one all right let me test to see I can lift one yes if it doesn't Bend when you lift it then you know it has cooled enough to transfer to the cooling rack once your cookies have cooled then you can plate them pack them store them wrap them up for gifting but whatever you do make sure you save at least one for yourself chefs reward the first cookie mmm okay ultimately when you eat a crinkle cookie it ends up all over you just warning you and warning myself because it's going to happen mm-hmm it's no wonder crinkle cookie is a holiday favorite with that crispy outside in the soft chewy Center and of course all those beautiful spices it is one of my personal holiday favorites and I really hope it becomes one of yours happy holidays", "SQ8QqxjbjRs": "today we're gonna make old-fashioned ginger snaps this recipe came to me from my neighbor and i've been making it ever since every christmas we're gonna start with 3 4 of a cup of butter make sure it's nice and soft just at room temperature so it will cream together easily with the sugar [Music] so it's one cup of granulated sugar and then we're going to cream that together until it's nice and smooth [Music] then crack one egg into the bowl and mix again [Music] measure out one quarter cup of molasses [Music] the molasses is what gives these ginger snaps a nice chewy texture the edges are crisp the center is chewy it's just delicious [Music] do [Music] once that's all mixed together we're gonna start on our dry ingredients so we've got two cups of all-purpose flour we're gonna add a quarter teaspoon salt two teaspoons of baking soda one teaspoon of ground cinnamon one teaspoon of ground cloves and one teaspoon ground ginger go ahead and give that a mix before adding it to the bowl [Music] i usually like to add half of the dry ingredients and then give it a mix and then add the rest so that it has a chance to incorporate this dough will be just a bit on the sticky side but it does not require a chilling time [Music] when the dough is ready i like to use a spring-loaded cookie scoop so that all of the cookies are about the same size and we're going to roll it in granulated sugar you could also use a coarser sparkling sugar either one works great [Music] these cookies will flatten and crackle as they bake there's no need to press them down we're going to bake them in an oven preheated to 350 degrees and they'll take about 11 to 13 minutes to bake [Music] all right looking good i just love the way my house smells when these cookies are baking it is just what christmas should smell like now when the cookies come out and they're nice and warm right out of the oven this is a good time if you care to to shape the cookies that got a little bit out of shape in the oven just making them nice and round after they've cooled for just a bit on the baking sheet go ahead and transfer them to a cooling rack the cookies will stay just a bit chewy in the middle but those crispy edges are my favorite i hope these old-fashioned ginger snaps will be something that you enjoy this christmas as well [Music] i know my family loves them and we make them every year so thankful to my neighbor for sharing them with us merry christmas", "zsPN15BPpXw": "ready for cookie mmm mama has the videos it's good cookie molasses cookie who made this cookie that's

bite oh it's a big bite of a molasses cookie you know what goes nicely with the cookie head bunk hey", "FoY6hjRB07Y": "hello hello all and welcome back to cooking with ken chef mark here bringing you a second cookie video this time we are making my absolute favorite cookie flavor in the whole world and the reason for the season gingerbread now we're working with our electric stand mixer today instead of working with our hands the way we did before with the snickerdoodles that's because we're going to be using molasses in this cookie recipe molasses as you may or may not know is super sticky and not very easy to work with you're going by hand and that's going to be too much of a mess to keep up with so in here half a cup of my molasses three quarter cups of brown sugar and four ounces or one stick of butter i'm gonna bring my mixer down get that locked into position if you don't have a stand mixer like this at home you are very welcome to use an electric hand mixer just be very wary of the speed you're using you want to make sure you're mixing on a low speed so you're not whipping a bunch of air into this now in our locked position i'm just going to turn it up to the very first speed setting which is stir on my mixer i'm just going to allow these to cream together it's going to have a it's going to be very dark in color because of the molasses and there's going to be these streaks almost or specks of butter throughout and that's just because they're naturally not going to mix the liquids and the fats but that's perfectly fine once we add our dry ingredients it'll all homogenize i always scrape down the sides here bowl to make sure everything's getting mixed in well that's good enough there yeah into my mixer bowl just like with these snickerdoodles i'm going to add my egg and vanilla just one large egg and one teaspoon of vanilla extract and mixing again just until everything comes together and there we go you can see what i mean by those specks of butter not quite wanting to mix in with the other liquids but again that's perfectly fine it looks exactly the way it should now we just have to add our dry ingredients in this bowl here i have two and one-third cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda which i have sifted since this is a gingerbread cookie of course we're going heavy on the ginger with a whole tablespoon of ginger ground ginger two teaspoons of cinnamon half a teaspoon of allspice half a teaspoon of nutmeg and a fourth teaspoon of clove all finished out with a half teaspoon of salt just gonna add that all into our bowl here carefully and now our dough shall come together and that ginger smell is already permeating the air right now [Music] we're going to shut the mixer off right there got a very nice crumbly dough i'm going to remove my mixer and get the very bottom scraped thoroughly with my spatula just to make sure all of my ingredients are homogenized into the dough major shout out to jess former owner of flour to leave for always getting on to me for scraping there's always a little bit at the bottom of the bowl that you're not accounting for that is not mixed in and you get wonky cookies with that we want all of our cooks to be beautiful and uniform get really deep in there scrape the walls scrape the bottom make sure everything is mixed in that can't be all right now i'm going to get my bowl removed from the mixer and get the mixer out of the way so that we can roll this dough out there are gingerbread cookie recipes that yield a very sticky dough as a matter of fact the flour delete bakery when i worked there we had such a recipe i loved it of course i can give jess's secrets away here but i wanted to modify a recipe so that it was something more malleable and workable by hand because ours was so sticky to the point that even cookie scoops had difficulty just scooping them and getting them out of the device could even break some scoops so i'm making my dough a little less sticky to avoid that problem and also allow me to transition straight into rolling cutting and baking otherwise i'd have to wait at least two to three hours for the dough to chill and reach a point that i could work with it get our surface flowered well too fun fact if you have a sweeter tooth you can also use powdered sugar but i'm not trying to add any sweetness to this the cookie is sweet enough as it is now it's going to roll from the center back towards myself from the center forward just using the weight of the rolling pin no extra pressure applied turning between rolls just to make sure my dough doesn't stick to the surface just this repeated motion of out and in and turning if you have peace that fall off like that that's fine push them to the side they can always be added back to the dough [Applause] i'm going to check on the thickness and this is about where i want it about a quarter of an inch thick i'm going to feel the surface of my dough for evenness i can feel areas here and here that are just a little unlevel i'm just going to lightly smooth those there we go and now we got our cookie cutters standard gingerbread men and we've also got these cute little ninja bread men that are going to be kung fu fighting across our plates just gonna cut out as many as you like as many as the dough makes i do three regulars and work some ninja bread in there do one more regular and from here we just peel away the edges and we'll gather all this up into another ball of dough and roll that out just like we did here and get all the cookies we can out of this just carefully getting these guys transferred to the pan um so gingerbread is my favorite holiday treat and just favorite cookie period do y'all have any favorite holiday [Music] treats [Music] so i've got a few cookies with some extra dough in their grooves i'm just going to take this toothpick to try and cleanly remove that anywhere you see that or in these tight crevices there we go all right got my pans full oven preheated at 350 degrees and now it's time for our cookies to go into the oven and just like with our snickerdoodles these are going to go for five minutes they're going to rotate after that five minutes to ensure even baking also flip shelves in the oven and they're going to bake for an additional five minutes after which they should be done in the meantime we're going to get cleaned up and i come back we're going to be making our royal icing for the cookies all right our 10 minutes have elapsed for the cookies they are ready to come out of the oven they've already done their rotating and shelf swapping they smell amazing and they look amazing all that remains to happen with these is for them to cool and once they have finished cool we can apply our icing to them which we are going to go ahead and get busy making all right here we are about to make our royal icing now oftentimes you'll find royal icing recipes using meringue powder i decided to mix that today so we don't have to go out and buy specialty ingredients we're just using egg whites sugar vanilla and a little lemon juice so i've got three egg whites in the bowl of my mixer here i'm going to juice out one teaspoon of lemon juice and what this is going to do is neutralize any harmful bacteria in the egg whites make this completely safe for us to have just going to whisk that for a little bit just to get it mixed in and the rest of the icing is super simple we're going to add about a pound of powdered sugar to this i'm going to get this bag open and just slowly steadily add and watch the consistency of my icing as it develops and because you're using powdered sugar make sure you're doing this on a very low speed if you do a high speed it's just going to fly out of the bowl erupt into the air into your hair all over your kitchen it's not going to be fun to clean up but once you've got so much powdered sugar mixed in then you can start to increase your speed so then i get a spatula to scrape these walls down all right now i'm going to check the consistency of the icing i don't want to mix on too high for too long and end up overworking it what we should see which seems to be exactly what's happening here is as the icing falls in on itself it should briefly hold its shape but eventually melt back into the pool and homogenize again but this is the desired consistency you can see i can almost kind of draw with it on the surface it holds just briefly in a matter of seconds it's all gone i don't need to do any more whisking no more sugar needs to be added i'll just take this opportunity to go ahead and add our vanilla flavor one teaspoon and this is going to slightly tinge the color of the icing so if you're wanting to um keep this as wide as possible you could use a clear imitation extract or you could use almond extract as an alternative and there we have these soon to be done cooling once those are done this icing is going to go into piping bags and we're going to start getting our cookies decorated [Music] so um so okay looking a little darker [Applause] all right just cutting very very small holes into the tips of my piping bag it's going to be very fine line work starting with my ordinary gingerbread men it's going to frost a border around the perimeter of the cookie and then i'm going to fill it setting up that border first prevents the ice cream from just flowing all over the place going off the sides of the cookies because that border is going to set up before our filling does that's the thing about royal icing you've got to work relatively quickly with it once you've piped and allowed it to dry it's hard and set and there's nothing more you can do with it [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] there we go like i said before it's going to give those a little bit of time to dry it's not going to take long like five minutes or less and then i'm going to go over this and fill them [Music] [Music] so [Music] now to try out our gingerbread man i said this once the beginning of the video already i really love gingerbread cookies this is so good the ginger is so forward lingers on the back of the tongue after a while and it's bounced out nicely by the sweetness of the icing and even though there's lemon juice in here i really don't get any lemon flavor interfering with that thank you all again for joining this has been cooking with ken i'm chef mark remember to like and subscribe if you've enjoyed leave some comments letting us know what you'd like to see in the future and we'll be seeing you next time with much fewer cookies [Music] [Music] you", "Y8Ygyo6vXbg": "okay good morning to my kitchen that was in a very loud good morning welcome to cooking with Sally Jay we're here with my granddaughter Chelsea she's my third grandchild um can see dawn she's gonna help me make molasses cookies she made some a few weeks ago and I had one and they're the best my last idea yeah I had two I ate meat pods because he hated big pizza cakes I said well yeah I'm gonna eat the cookie so I needed a project to do for fathers for Father's Day which is tomorrow and I thought what are we gonna do what am I gonna give them I remembered the cookies Oh Chelsea do you want to help me make the cookies so she goes oh sure and then Charlie goes oh yeah you could make a video of it and I'm like well that was not my intent I wish you could see Charlie a background with little kids clothes on trying to make a flap so anyway today June 20th no 2020 it's a Saturday we are going to make molasses cookies for the fathers in our church and Chelsea's recipe is the best so I'm gonna let her do it she does not want to talk a lot but you never know what will happen right okay so we're gonna start out and you have to speak in a big voice and tell them what you're doing okay this is homemade molasses cookies and there's a I know what the ingredient innocence makes it so good and if I would have known what was in it I probably would not have eaten the cookie because I hate coffee but there is coffee in this rest it has to be hot coffee and I think that's what makes it moist so we're gonna start out she doesn't want to talk she just want to stand there and look cute Chelsea is now officially a freshman in high school she just graduated eighth grade with highest honors in her class so we're pretty proud of her see she's got a voice alright we're gonna start out with one cup of sugar and I'm gonna teach her a few things too because she thought she needed to be of this thing you can bring this up and then you have one cup of molasses she's gonna use this she's made these at home so she probably wishes I wasn't here healthy because I she was a little slower hey patience is still up there on that roof you just want to get all the molasses right now how does a beer gonna make some it will so then we have one full cup of Crisco now you can use whatever shortening you prefer I just like Crisco it has always I just want Crisco it works so that's why I always go to that so what she probably doesn't do at home but we are gonna do here we are going to start the mixer and if you remember if you watch my resurrection cookies or whoopie pies it is very loud so just be patient Goodspeed probably medium [Music] Charlie I don't know what you can see over there but they're getting their coffee okay so next she is going to be putting in two teaspoons of baking soda and then she's gonna put in a half a cup of hot coffee which we you can make more I don't know what kind of coffee would get this one now she's putting in one egg and then a teaspoon of vanilla she's finding out that two women in a kitchen as a pain I'm just glad she's helping father's days tomorrow then we got to make 50 cookies so now she's putting in a teaspoon of cinnamon and then she'll be putting in a half a teaspoon of ginger now she's putting in one teaspoon of salt and she's gonna mix now she's going to be putting in four and 1/2 cups of flour get rid of it all then once the corporative [Music] and your Amin will be on 350 needs to be preheated to 350 [Music] okay okay so now I'm gonna take this part off and we're just gonna just want you to see the texture of them see the tech is sticky but it's not bad so she's gonna take the spatula and she's going to mix it well and then she's gonna cover it with saran wrap well she can cover it with saran she wants to do I would just put some paper to use to go in the refrigerator chill for several hours I would say [Music] this is what that looks like it's nice and sticky this recipe can be dropped by tablespoonfuls or rolled out and cut and we're gonna roll out and cut so she's gonna get saran wrap chatzi I don't want saran wrap just we're going to just put parchment paper on it last night before I went to bed I made up a batch of this so that we could just do the video and we are gonna roll this out for you she's gonna need a rolling pin but I guess that's nice for me to know I would have okay [Music] she is now going to make the cookie heart and I don't I thought she would roll it out but she says she doesn't need to roll it out so we'll see what she does so I need to know what you're doing so I put the type of flower on my face and then I take the dough and put it on this flower you know then I like smush it out or my cookies right my Italian story chop seems about no no he's to go over to hammer why I wanted to take a walk I like walks and you're walking too fast and she wasn't keeping up and choosing a little snip and I snapped at her and I said I've had enough and we were still close enough to the house that I said you need to turn around go stay feet long and she went to turn around I really didn't want her to go back by herself as I didn't wanna go backward so I sat at her okay so you press this out do you how do you know what thickness well it doesn't need to be too thick but you don't want it too thin they really care about shape she's like her Mimi and so I would not yeah you are so now she's cutting him out and she doesn't put them on parchment paper about we're gonna so we got the pan lined with parchment paper and she's just lining it up on the pan we have our oven set to 350 so I want to finish your story so we're here we are on Main Street in Washburn and I'm trying to explain to her

she SAS and I said and I'm SAS and back and after a minute I'm looking at my body and I'm like and I'm looking at her and she was like I was looking in a mirror and I'm like I don't know what people are made to think I said okay fine Chelsea she goes well fine I walk and she walked but I come home and I told Gru's I said oh my word it was like looking and I'm arrow back hey keep my memory on
