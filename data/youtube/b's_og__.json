{"7A-w-7V1auU": "yo what is going on youtube it is og and we are finally back so guys power league just came out um you can probably tell i look very tired it is let me see the time 8 30 a.m so i haven't slept in like over a day but we've just been grinding power league um unfortunately i did start not in the highest when possible i started gold two my teammates are gold through so they're like plot or diamond whatever it's called they're ahead of me but this is pretty much how it goes down so any of the maps in the broadstars championship prize or finals qualifiers whatever it is they are available to play okay we actually got backyard bull we have not we got this map once we've gotten like such bad maps all night we're like not getting any bravo so it's nice to finally get it so first off jigsaw is our captain um for power league um and he is gonna ban along with their team doing blind bands i think because i'm pretty sure i've seen the same brawler band from both sides so dog mr ruff's colonel ruffs mr p again 8 30 am no sleep those are gonna be the bands oh i'm first pick i should pay attention oh where's byron i want to play byron okay we're gonna pick byron if we missed it we'd get kicked out so good thing we picked byron quickly i think we get kicked out i don't know i always like catch it at like one second so i haven't gone kicked out yet um hopefully i don't do that during the youtube video but i'll probably do two matches i'm not sure i don't really recognize anyone on the other team but hopefully it's a good game we've had some pretty solid games so far um we faced like a few pro teams and stuff like that so it's definitely fun when you get into those competitive modes and i really like the draft aspect but i think our team comps looking pretty solid so far we should be able to make bobby bs pretty much invincible with uh speed and healing they do have b though b's a good pick and brock just got a buff too so this will be interesting i think i think we should be fine though so hopefully jig lets me go a bit alright guys game number one um so byron is probably one of my better brothers right now i hope i don't joke because i'm tired um so we are just going to back off let them spam out a few shots and we're going to go for some damage just to build their super up i can probably just pass bobby the ball and they'll score yeah so they just let bobby walk by and he can just walk it in on the brock honestly and that it's going to be as simple as that so don't let shelby just walk down your lane guys and i don't even have to heal him he just like literally just bodies his way down the lane so he's gonna need our help on the bee though and [Music] we are gonna give him some heels but it's gonna not be enough so i'm just gonna pop my gadget to stay alive gotta watch out brock can score here so uh he dodged her one shot so that is gonna let him it was a good dodge by him and um you know bobby's gonna switch lanes yeah so you can definitely do a lot better on the eight bit i'll give him a heal and we'll just put the ball up a little bit we'll throw our super out and we can take the brock out too this should be game so we'll give jiggy some heels just go scored what are you doing jigsaw okay jigsaw doesn't want to win um he's going to pass to bobby but jigsaw definitely could have scored there so hold on we don't really have a wall break only downside i should be more accurate hopefully they break their own walls kind of nice we can just wait for bobby and he can just kind of force his way through hopefully uh yeah i got hit by two shots and because of the 8-bit turret but we still won the game already i don't know why jigsaw didn't want to score there it's kind of weird so by the way best pin in the game than our new year pins very op um we are going to push our way up slowly we want to get rid of that 8-bit turret but we also want to make sure bobby okay bobby can just score if i screw the ball up to him i think i'm lagging a little bit jake just scored jigsaw just scored please just score just score all right that is going to be game number one so it's as easy as that with byron and like max or like anyone like relatively tanky just got to heal them and a lot of times they will be able to score so i don't think bobby's just walk up strat is gonna work again um so we will get some heals though and well we'll put it to jigsaw's side and we'll tap the brock once bobby's gonna get nice he'll take out the b and he can just pass it and this should be a goal so we'll play for my teammates i don't really have to do much i think i hit like one shot kind of pressure them but um that is just how it goes with max comp sometimes you literally don't have to do anything you just kind of walk up and get position and yeah that is going to be game as long as jigsaw okay there we go so we will take our first game i'll probably do one more maybe we'll see how it goes all right guys game number two momo missed all of you guys say hi momo force the low um so we got nuts and bolts this side we've gone this map a few times i really like tick they also completely reworked his one little dash gadget now has six minds it's really good so both uh yeah both of us banned kernel ruffs so it is blind bands uh oh right every single time i always forget it's me so i'm gonna take tick uh like i just said i've been enjoying him i'm gonna do the new gadget it is really good for getting the first bolt which is really huge and you can kind of like spam out like the second bolt two or third bolt but they're gonna pick dynamic um dynamic jessie so it takes pretty good into this so far let's see what bobby picks um but i think i don't recognize these players either so hopefully it's good all right so we have double thrower it's kind of risky in drafts collette interesting so they wanted to pick collette into double thrower max i i guess it's okay in the max but i would have picked like a bb or like even a mort maybe um so yeah they don't really have anyone fast so i think i'll just let jigsaw i'll send it out but i think i'll save my gadget okay he's gonna gadget too so um yeah jigsaw should be able to just hold that one down and you can see the six mines it's just so much area denial they also changed the way that uh takes shot explodes so now it's a lot wider before it was more clumped up it's better for area denial but one thing that i did notice is before you just auto in the safe and it would hit all three shots and you can't do that anymore it literally goes around it so if you're lucky you'll hit like one shot if you just auto and save so it's kind of sad but um you know if you do the gadget i think you can get three so i'm going to throw my ticket on the other side so the jesse doesn't hit it hopefully it makes it too safe yeah nice it's going to connect and get it down to about 40 30 so that's really good and we just keep them out of lane as long as possible with tick like i said really good area denial we don't even need this gadget right now we'll throw this at the dynamic just to kind of waste a shot he's gonna jump over it the tick does not care the tick is going straight for that jesse or whoever it hit and we should be able to finish it here honestly their comp is kind of troll i have no idea why they would pick colette and do it so one of the downsides is it's not a downside but you gotta be really sure about your comp because there's no it's just like the best of three on a map you can't change comps so i like it because you know it's fast and efficient we can finish here but uh you got to be really sure of the comp that you chose so at the end you could kind of see that the take gadgets or tick suit like attack was just everywhere so it's harder to hit the safe now only downside i think it's better for bounty though so it spreads more and you can get like bounty was more like poke anyways so it's definitely fine there again we can just throw some regular shots and then for this one we can throw a gadget just to kind of like secure for a spot for sure um we'll help jigsaw out there and he's gonna dive in on the colette we'll just keep the jesse away from that as long as possible but it's fine we're gonna get first spot and honestly i think we go for a one push i do have my tick head and bobby has super he's gonna trip it down did he hit it yeah okay so bobby's gonna hit that and we're just gonna go for it honestly okay i'll tank for the bot um and yeah you can see unfortunately i'm only hitting like one right now but we're gonna one push anyways really straightforward game unfortunately we didn't get super competitive games like i was hoping for uh these guys so i think that's silver one gold one gold two so i'm gold three my teammates are diamond um but you know you guys understand the mode and hopefully you guys like this kind of content because i've been enjoying this and i definitely want to do more content on power league so yeah guys i'll try to upload more consistently uh like i said i'm enjoying power league and i want to do some pro game play as well we're in a lot of tournaments we just got second yeah i know second say this last year in uh the monthly finals so we're in the case of cup 2 upload some of those games and like qualifiers and stuff like that but that is gonna be it for today's video i gotta focus on my power league it is 8 30 a.m and yeah i'll see you guys soon peace [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "bSG2OL3v1XE": "yo what's going on youtube it is og and today we had the update guys so i've been playing present plunder all day with these two sweats currently the number one number two world record trophy holders honestly it's just jigsaw and buffy it's not that exciting guys um so yeah we're just been on present plunder they're just kind of pushing everyone i've just been rotating like trying people out i've been playing spike but maybe i'll switch i was having a good time with mr p he's actually really strong right now so this is mr p to start it off and yeah let's get into the video all right guys game number one what i've learned so far is spawners are pretty good so jesse pam colt feels really good too i can't really i can defend it better than how i could before but you can just do that still um so yeah mr p still kind of gets destroyed by a few of those brawlers but he can fare a little better um and that's not really a fair comparison so we'll like we'll get our penguins out and get set up and then because it's always been a control brother right like they're not gonna change the entire play type of it but hopefully yeah he's just gonna do the same thing uh he's actually more focused on the present this time which is probably smart but you can just see you five shot more now so it's actually a really big difference before it would take a six shot um and we're gonna get the first one my penguins are just gonna like distract them a little bit they'll tank you know what you can deal with my penguin if you want so i actually get them really low there wow so we can take them out here hopefully or at least leave them for jiggy and you know what i want to get them more at nice so the quilt has a gadget he's going to look for us or jigsaw yeah okay so he's going to get us open the map up a little bit we'll just pop that to harass him you know he's a gadget on us got someone back his way um and okay we traded with mort though he did walk into my suitcase we're gonna win right here so hopefully you guys get to see me walk the president because it's fun it's my favorite part of the boat um but we're gonna take game number one all right guys game number two so mort is really strong we were playing mort for a bit but i think they pushed it all they needed to i really feel like playing more even though he did get a buff so now he actually heals more uh so i thought his damage for the bats must okay we gotta be careful because he can just do the same thing that happened to us last time so we're gonna trick him and hit a few shots this morning's playing it really poorly uh we almost won we just got pinched by everyone on their team otherwise i think we win that but it doesn't matter as long as we get wait why does it look like they're stinky is that the poco gadget looks like they didn't shower for a while we just won our penguins honestly even though like mr p is like main attacks a lot stronger he's still like relying on his penguins so we are gonna just try chipping the mort down it's really good if he goes on that side and just stays away from the jump pads because it's easier to like kind of track them um okay so yeah i guess that green aura is a poco's gadget jigsaw hopefully you can defend you do have your uh your gadget so it should be good we're gonna get the colt here and we'll just take him out bobby should be able to defend okay yeah so we'll just get a really good position and i'll move my penguins up a whole two tiles guys and that's going to be game changing for us i'm just going to pop my gadget because i have a feeling that this game is going to end really soon um and i i've been pretty stingy with them so bobby's really knocking the super though oh okay maybe he's bming he wants the game to last longer i understand him uh present is gonna reset and okay so we'll just keep our space for more don't want to give him back value jigsaw's gonna take him out though and we can just focus on the poco a little bit it's easier to hit than the colt who can just chip us down from range he's deciding to jump over so i'll just play around this wall he's gonna just go for it actually um so you know what i'm gonna get my penguin uh to be big and bobby's gonna walk it down i think yeah we should be good he'd be having way too hard there toxic or pour up and we'll take game number two just because i i know make these like pretty pretty good um oh right i'm recording for youtube all right guys game number three um you can see everyone's playing more and they all have these uh gold silver skins they're not like nightwish more i don't know like it's just a no-brainer for me nightwish more is just by far best mortar skin so we are just going to roll up here and i think bobby okay nevermind gets taken out by the mort uh oh okay we can land that suitcase nice so we timed it so it dropped right when he landed jason's gonna get pinched uh maybe we can get max for him okay oh unfortunately we just hit our shot a second too late but bobby does have yeah okay i was gonna say he should go in there and we're just gonna back off because jesse's chair is actually pretty decent now especially with that slow you can see it got me pretty low um and my penguins are just gonna stay alive which is really good for us we're gonna pinch the max here and be able to take it out so you can see the extra damage finishing off the maxima before uh the buff that would not have been enough so you can see how much more it heals up there too i really don't know why they buff more i honestly thought he was in need of like a nerf if anything but they're gonna buff his healing which i don't know doesn't really make much sense to me but i think overall the balance changes were kind of decent definitely some questionable ones not a fan of the spike one revert um but besides that i think the brock one a little too much too in my opinion but um you know there was some fine ones i don't know why they buff pam that was kind of it's kind of wild too but it's hard to go over them all because there's like literally like 50. um so we're gonna get the max load up for bobby to one shot bobby super is it up to me i'll be super to me this guy doesn't like passing me i don't know why i've never done anything to make him not like passing me but oh jigsaw's just gonna get it and then we're gonna take game number three all right guys game number four i want to say um matchmaking is a little long so i've been like multitasking but we're trying out pam i have not used it we're gonna be using the damage for it though so i think jiggy can win that with the shield yeah so i was just kind of distracted i was looking over there but we are going to be using the damage shirt once again so it's out 800 per second that is a lot of damage i already thought it was fine how it was um but oops okay eight hundred percent so i'm just gonna don't okay oh wait i have a present okay guys this is the best part of present plunder bobby already know knew what was happening when he gave me the ball or the present like you're going to try stealing it from me oh wait wait oh he got it uh it's not fair he has a dash all right so we're gonna throw oh it's a leon clone i got baited oh you can just see how fast it rips through that leon clone guys it's insane bobby come on mr p get him oh no okay we didn't really get to show off him but i know it's gonna be strong so that's gonna be game number four alright guys last game of the video we got an 8-bit who's actually also very strong shadow 8-bit love that brawler um but yeah 8-bit oh okay so two pretty good pam counters colette is just a hard pam counter by the way guys if you did not know um so colette will just kind of like run through me and bobby i'm in a really awkward spot and i think the club's just gonna do that yeah so two very good pam counters and they're gonna get set up for their turret this is going to be a tough game i might have to relax on the commentating a bit and just focus on the game uh jigsaw should be pretty good into their comp i can't really play the game um i think they're going to score maybe unless bobby can stop them but this game is kind of unplayable for me honestly um colette with eight bit damage like one of her shots just did like i don't know how much but it was a lot and we're gonna just get this up here bobby's gonna break their turret open that's actually pretty good uh i kind of want to tank it for my turn if anything that way actually i'm kind of close to another turret so we're just gonna chip this down and we gotta time it when we can kill the colette so i think jigsaw is gonna be in charge of killing the colette we gotta make sure i'll cover mid but we'll get the cl oh we'll almost get her all right i'm just gonna drop my turret we're going aggro nice jump from jigsaw he's gonna get them oh we can score here we can score bobby he didn't throw it oh i threw it but uh probably threw it to me i think it would have been better but we are going to have to i don't know what we're going to do this game they counter me so hard jigsaw is like our win condition i think because bobby's gonna have a rough time too i'm just gonna ignore that and i'm gonna push up here and maybe i can get my damage shirt out maybe that can be something no i think we're just gonna lose all right oh that wasn't lucky i swear we killed it and maybe we could have defended that that was a really tough game though all right guys unfortunately we are ending on a loss um that was really really tough match-up uh for me and bobby specifically but you guys can see um a little of the updated brawlers and balanced ones and the overrated number one number two players in the world i'm kidding um but yeah guys present plunder i'm not really a huge fan of this map but i think it's okay definitely go try it out let me know what you guys think of it and yeah it's gonna be for today's video hope you'll enjoy it i'll see you all the world peace

"cBNKkEa1Ock": "[Music] yo what's going on guys welcome back to a brand new video on the channel inside of today's video we're gonna be going over the best comps and strategies for every single map for the upcoming championship challenge it's a bit of a late one normally upload this uh towards the beginning of the week before the championship challenge but as you guys know i've been grinding a lot of power league so giving you guys the best tips the best comps and whatever else and we're trying to keep it as short and concise as possible so don't confuse you guys too much and hopefully you'll be able to get 15 wins with my comps so yeah without further ado let's jump straight into it alright guys so moving into the first map of the championship challenge we have minecart madness so a bit of a wacky one for gem grab but in terms of competition as always with the first maps i do recommend just to play brothers that you're most comfortable with uh but in terms of brawlers are really really good op in the meta everyone should be able to have stu really free to play uh friendly pl uh rule obviously he's ten thousand trophies unlocked stu is absolutely insane right now down the lane he can basically take every single lane in the game especially tanks he can just dash into him and dash out especially low dps brawlers as well like mr p like sandy he can just chain up supers off them over and over again so if you guys have played a lot of stew he's gonna be absolutely insane i'll 100 recommend him in every single combo and then moving on to mid it kind of depends what you face really in gem grab a lot and maybe at the lower end of trophies we've seen a lot of tanks so i probably will recommend the likes of roofs if you've got them unlocked uh the likes of maybe like a bar on mid 8-bit mid be a little bit safer sprout it's really really good but in terms of low level he's probably not as better as best as it can be because of all the tanks and the aggro brothers that people like to play you've just got so many options as you've seen in the graphic you've got amber down the lane as well who could be really really good you just actually press a gadget or twitter and you're gonna be winning a lot of different lanes to be honest there's a lot of different combos you can pick on this map and it's not really too much strategy going into it basically the way i kind of like things is uh let the minecart push you back a lot of times don't really force the pressure and then when you get a minecart pushing them into spawn make sure you're using that making sure you're keeping them into spawn and then just try and keep pressure try and hold the mid for as long as possible until you eventually get pushed back but definitely don't force anything on this map because that's going to get trapped and lose all your gems so play it safe play it comfortable and push together as a team but that's gonna be minecart madness really simple first map to start things off let's hop into map number two right guys moving on to map number two it's going to be shooting stars so before when the championship challenge is and start the bow nanny strategy was the best one and now it's changed obviously with the bow gadget nerf uh danny's still going to be the golden pick for me that is absolutely insane on this map i think it's her best map in the game and especially with her new gadget return to sander what is what this allows you to do especially the high dps brothers like brock piper nanny herself with the head you can just tank so many shots it basically gives you a cheat code uh to stand alive basically it can keep you alive for so many uh interactions you've also got a super that can basically one shot most brothers that people play on this map so yeah that is gonna be absolutely insane and then down the mid i would opt for either a tick or a sprout for me personally tick just offers a little bit more ranges especially with the uh recent change to him they actually changed i think it was supposed to be enough but he actually extended his range and is even more annoying on this map tick is absolutely insane especially if using the last hurrah gadget what you can do as well with that gadget is tank nanny heads and just stay alive for one second knockback aggro brawlers as well really insane gadget event down the right i tend to use a niagara but not like a longer range brawler like a piper or a byron either one is uh actually find it for that one and go over to other picks as well mr p is a solid option of course with his gadget he can get so much pressure forcing the enemy back constantly the other thing is it's really hard to actually confirm the kill with mississippi but it's good for control and then also you've got the likes of brock as i said the secret strategy but i love to use with brooke it's break open those mid walls and then what that enables it to do it's just a long range battle so you can use the likes of pipe and nanny brock and just break up the whole map and then you're going to be outraged and basically everyone in the game you've also got the likes of max who can basically win a lot of 1v1 interactions but shooting star it's just going to all be about who can pinch the best who can actually win their 1v1 interactions at the best so that's going to be shooting star let's hop into map number three guys so now i'm moving on to map number three sieges where things get a little bit harder but again that stu is going to be the best pick by far in siege the ability just to dash around wherever you want to be it's kind of crazy wins basically every single interruption that he's involved in especially with that dash you want to be using stew you can use the gadget to bring your teammates closer to the mid much quicker than any reason as i said stu is just going to be basically winning every single 1v1 interaction bb he's just gonna absolutely dominate you can just keep dashing in dashing out dashing in dash now maybe it's not going to even get a shot in it's kind of crazy froze as well stu is going to be able to target really well that's going to be enough about stu he's crazy broken right now uh best alternatives as well bali's a really solid pick especially since he got a buff to his star power extra nostrils what this allows him to do is basically he can just shred through even the likes of bb now as long as he keeps his distance bali is actually a decent counter to phoebe because of how much damage he actually does it's also got really good damage against the i think that's the most important thing because if you get like one push you basically can near enough end it in one push with barley's damage now it's kind of crazy and then the likes of the other good alternative picks it's kind of dude there's a lot of different picks you can use on this siege but you can use the likes of rough and saying everywhere as you guys know you've also got mr p who's already solid option in siege right now bb to collect the bolts you can use either star power uh sandy's really good for control i've got like some max and amber who likes serve the same purpose max can help collect the first bolt amber can do the same as well you've also got jackie jean and take their bit of uh off meta kind of picks uh but honestly you can use a lot of different things but as always with siege you've got to focus as a team to try and collect the first robot and then just keep control for as long as possible pushing together but that's going to be siege map number three let's swap into mobile all right guys now moving on to hot zone split so you guys have guessed it the golden pick is going to be stu again down the aggressive lane he's going to be able to counter basically every single brawler in the game is crazy with his super the dash in that shower ability the fact that you can just dodge so many shots with the super in fact you can just dash into people and keep training it over and over again it's crazy broken right now and also with the gadget placement you can see i placed it down the left what this enables uh you literally a whole team to do is respawn push up the map quicker and also vertical basically stay on the edge of that uh little totem whatever whatever it's called and he can just uh spread his shots a lot quicker across the map getting you total control a lot easier so moving on to the next pick it's going to be tick if you guys have played split you've seen how dominant tick is and just helping both lanes out all the time it's really annoying to deal with the spam the constant supers the constant uh just being able to stay alive with his gadget tick is just crazy good right now and then moving on to roofs you guys know ruff's probably not the best brother in the game as well as stew right now and russ with his upgrades what do you want to be doing first and foremost is giving a tick because he's going to be one standing alive for the long part because he's going to be shooting at a distance and then stu and then himself you always want to give your teammates the uh well the upgrade first because you're going to get hp boost and you're also going to get damage boost it's kind of crazy how uh op the op rulers are with this upgrade of course like the brothers are already opie at north and then you give them this upgrade they're going to be even stronger so that's why russ is so good right now you just got an everlasting upgrade to your teammate then going into next picks as well miss p is good everywhere right now literally every single map you can just use a mr p also got the likes of serge is good edgar can be good aggro bibi rico and jesse they're going to be really defensive bb and jessie's kind of up to you what you want to use but that's going to be the picks for hotzone let's hop into the final one okay guys moving into the fifth and final map is going to be sneaky fields and i've got an insane strategy for this map basically every single pro team uses inside of scrims and just in uh tournament gameplay so the number one com by far in my opinion it's going to be max sandy and rosa rose is the number one golden pick here because of her gadget she's absolutely crazy op right now being able to basically stun everyone in the bushes it basically gives you control of all three lanes and especially if you give her a max speed just going to be running into people's faces and there's nothing that can take a rosa down with that super and just the amount of hp she has she's crazy as i said but max and rose are going to be the two brothers which i recommend i'm sure that combination is crazy right now if you're not too comfortable maxie can go with the jesse mid as she's also pretty good right now on this map just destroying tanks you've also got amber down the lane if you want to try and counter the roses amber down the lane can be really good especially if using a wild flame star power what you can do just set a light to grass satellite to a cover and you should be able to be decent in the long run and going into alternative picks you can use byron i don't really like baron too much because you really need grass control and it can be really bad uh because you get on basically it's counted by really aggro brawlers uh you've also got the likes of down the lanes you can go uh ruffs ross is good everywhere right now mr pl probably won't really go on this map but he can use him because he can just get destroyed by the rosa they've also got nietzsche who can deal well with her rosa you've always got stu of course he's going to be insane on rubble right now and but that's going to be a rubble it should be pretty simple with his combo right guys it's gonna be the end of today's video hope you enjoyed my god a bit more of a shorter guide at this time around because i didn't want to confuse too many people just talking about the comps to strategies but these strategies i've played a lot with and i feel like gonna be by far the best combos to use so let me know how you get on uh tomorrow it's actually starting it's gonna be some good fun but hopefully you guys do make it this time around i do see a lot of positive comments saying that video really helps so i do really appreciate uh if you actually drop some support if these guys help you out but that's going to be the end of today's video hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to like comment and subscribe and i'll see you all next time [Music] you", "1xXd_OsMHTc": "[Music] yo what's going on guys welcome back to another video on the channel today's video we're going to be going in solos again you can see i've already grounded up to diamond to while we're grinding i probably played like a few hours on solos but you can see there's all the people at the top ranked which i want to be getting but we're going to be doing a little bit i won't really say trolling but we're going to be using what about i'm best with mortis and solos so okay moving on to the next one let's see what we're picking this time around so i'm gonna have to go mortise on kaboom canyon why have you given me maps and mortise isn't the best on i'm going to be banning uh who do we burn ban roofs hopefully our teammate goes too that's kind of what he want to do well baron could have been good as well borrows probably no more big on kaboom actually that's a lie uh but he's gonna be going colts ah i can see this isn't gonna go well i mean colt's a decent pick on kaboom but not a decent first pick mr p all right that's a good target for my mortise yep can we win maybe let's see our teammate goes he's got clip picked i feel so bad from there they're really gonna hate me i'm surprised i'll be surprised if they don't rage quit out yep and we're gonna have to do it tom mortis ah i'm sorry guys uh one of my teammates are gonna rage quite a night i know it they're gonna rage quite sure on 15 seconds please hurry up don't reach quit on me that's the one thing about this it's actually no like penalty system so if i go mortise uh they can actually just rage quit and just get a new one which i don't really advise doing most for the most part won't ever advise doing it but if your teammates using a really bad brawler like morty's in the heist i would quit immediately so yeah but here it's gonna be going ahead with it so let's see if we can get the win i've got a non-max max which can be pretty decent i mean i'm actually good against all of his brothers that set for max i can uh actually oh but get me on the mrp and i should be doing some work so let's go into this these guys are probably really bad yeah already all of them are really really angry i'm just gonna go straight on this mr p as long as we can keep him out of the picture we should be doing okay so i'm gonna dash out of trouble here i'm probably gonna get taken down by the porter which isn't really good we need this collect to hit airport which isn't moving okay have they got bush control yes we have with mr p trying to take him down here see if we can get both of them down to see what is this insane on heist you just gotta it's gonna trust me guys you gotta trust me if i keep control of this mid bush i'm gonna be winning this game so i'm gonna wait for my dash to charge up see what we can go ahead and do here we've got max just trying to go in this isn't going to work for you buddy i'm just going to use my gadget just to make sure we actually get them down as i'll be spending so long trying to take that max down i was super from my clap for now i can do is kill this mr pig probably chain on the safe here i'm just gonna die i'm not gonna waste my backs there i'd rather just get a little bit of damage spawn up with my bats and just win a lot of different matchups so fifty percent left see these guys are raging but i'm better than mortis vendor probably with the best baller in heist so yeah we're going to be able to get both of these down and we're doing a really good job here let's just take down this porter got good control off the mid bush that's all you need in kaboom canyon just get control of this mid so i don't know what this i'm uh lucky mr people trying to save or something we can just go aground this mr p it's a good job to pick mr p because we can just chain off him that's kind of the thing about mr p is that it's really hard counted by aggro brothers but then aggro bro there's going to be hard counters as well but it's probably like the most safe pick you could go let's get a chain on max as well yeah mike's trying to run away from the chain but you're not going to be able to escape it it's max with a little bit b i'm just going to go into that corner because hopefully they try and get me out here mr p yeah you're going to get you're going to get killed buddy get chained on come on we need a coat on the safe that's going to be gg in the first game look at that mortise in height don't even laugh at me guys insane let's hop into the next one let's see if we can get another win that should be hilarious i thought i was gonna tilt so easily okay mr p again so it's all about matchups for morris i forgot mr p can actually go morris basically everywhere so let's see whether we can destroy this time i'm just going to be helping him this time around so let's try and waste that i'm just going to dash here and here we need to get our supers before we can actually win a lot of matchups i think the first uh time of mort is you always just want a suicide envy of super get as many uh hits towards it as possible then you can start the real business so we're going to be going on to mr p here we've got porter honors we've got max up close to about to take her down do waste my bats there unfortunately it's not too much of a waste i'm still like a couple of shots off it oh oh claire is going ham this clay is really really good i'm surprised we've got some good randoms on our team our cult breaks open their mid which i never really recommend doing uh with coal especially in kabum canyon let's just wait for a long dash here still got two gadgets left to use pretty decent nice dash from our collet oh okay i'll dash into the wall of course he won't be a mortise video about me dashing into a wall i'm just gonna try and stay alive here into the corner okay yes we might stay alive so i've i've had to waste while they've had to waste a super on me to take me down it's only more so it should have just left me in the corner if i'm honest let's see if i can do any more damage no she can't but maybe if i sneak through i can end it right here so let's try and get these guys to focus on okay they're going to be running away so let's try and take them down super i'm going to get taken down by this fire so maybe we'll go aggro on this max oh 15 left can we actually do it can we actually win with moyes and the heist three percent left can i collect get the last few shots we've got a colt running in here come on let more is finishings let morris finish it come on guys you know you want to guys come on one percent left one last mortise no the colt finished it but regardless we're able to win with more is that's absolutely hilarious we actually managed to win remotes in the heist okay one more game left we're actually close to diamond three as well so that's actually that's so so funny hopefully i don't get siege or highest they're gonna be by far the worst modes canal grande okay yeah that's gonna be okay i don't want to ban any brothers like mortis uh hard counters so we're gonna be going for probably soon yeah that's one stone because dude's gonna just absolutely wreck me stew is crazy up here right now so our teammate is going to be hovering over the tick hopefully the enemy team actually bans come on see what we're going to be banning two seconds left and that's going to be another disconnect that's the problem with this game mode is that it's sometimes it could take me so long to get into a game because people just see my name like it's not even having like an ego or anything like that they just see my name they know that i'm a sweaty tryhard that just quit the game which is annoying to see uh let's see again so canal grande yep and oh we've got first pick he's hovering over oh is he hovering over tara i'm sorry but i'm banning tomorrow i can't i can't let him go tara he's hovering over tara and ken now grande it's never okay his next best pick is a power seven sandy ah can you like pick it like a mr p uh anything paul seven sandy oh it's gonna be like impossible to win it's actually gonna be impossible to win but for entertainment values i'll continue with this game if like uh i don't even know yet mortis we're gonna go mortise at least they've got a sprout and a mr p who i can absolutely wreck hopefully this guy doesn't go a complete hard counter like jackie well pray for me guys pray for my sanity it's gonna be okay much terminated thank the lord wait i just realized the sandy power seven was the one that terminated that okay maybe weird one you wanna be it was this actually mortis is probably the best map or actually facing off against a few people i think from last game are definitely facing off against that future guy again so first pick we're going to be banning ruffs hopefully our teammate picks do i'm going to be highlighting stu so hopefully he does go stew because that's going to be the best that one uh let's see i'll vape understood grandma got sandy picked oh sandy it's okay on julian people's spot i would never pick that first but mr p hmm let's see how this goes i'm gonna be hovering over mortis oh yeah okay what's can definitely write a jesse on a penny if i played it correctly hopefully they they're probably gonna go like jackie again he's gonna go jackie again oh i knew it the same guy just went jackie again all right i still should be able to do a decent job against these people sandy pick is really worrying though i don't really don't really like san diego's map just get spammed out by a bunch of different counters but let's go into it anyway so final game oh he's got smuggler penny skin that's actually a really nice skin i've not even had a chance to use it yet let's go with the emo see whether we can counter these guys efficiently so trying to get away from that jackie i thought i was at a distance where jackie couldn't kill me so really bad start for myself let's see what we can do here so even if we're training off the jackie to be honest shouldn't be the end of the world i was going to use my backseat to stay alive and confirm the kill against the penny if we got healed okay yeah he was going to be good with morris these guys are spinning on my team schubert's are just basically spawn chop these the entire time so i've got to keep my aggro up with these people let's just go straight on a penny use my bats to stay alive nice kill from my teammates yeah jackie really isn't a good pick either this jesse is having a hard time dealing with the amount of spam i'm just gonna wait for my long dash again i've to go aggrava keep up the aggro this jacket jack is going in behind here not too sure why i'm just going to go aggro on this jesse let's try and get a chain off i've got slow is crippling so so crippling but that's one of them down let's try and stay alive for as long as possible here again jesse's got another turret but we should go to chain office jackie and jess oh my that jesse turret just shreds me it honestly does okay we're still in this we're still in this but the second penny gets turret you can get so much control on the map so let's try and dodge our way into this penny let's see if we're able to chain off uh we're gonna get taken down by the jackie but hopefully our team can get control now both of them are really really low on this piece so we need to get some aggro back already down a couple of percentages so it shouldn't be the end of the world we're just gonna take this jesse down penny as well okay let's heal up let's wait for a long dash and then go in for one last attack see here we've got jack we need to get jackie off jackie come on oh no we're just going to get melted okay we're going to be losing the first game we lost a bit of control there with the penny turrets we can still win this one we still want this one fingers crossed okay ah probably that's probably my fault i didn't keep that i grew up for long enough it's really down to me staying alive and keeping them off as soon so straight again jackie's probably gonna go mid which don't really blame her because it's me of course jackie's wasted all of her shots so we can take her down that's the one time i can take jackie down so i've already got my bats which i'm going to be chaining against those guys just a penny left our pennies already got sorry okay this is bad and i've been shot so i'm just going to come back wait for my long dash and then go in again here put sandy towards jackie's going to basically waste all shots so i can chain off her really well now we're going to get taken down oh so so close okay and he's got the tutorial jesse's gotta turn up this is where it gets really risky not looking very likely for us that's why i definitely want to pick sandy as a first pick let's see if we can get his jesse down it's born to be really annoying it's a nice gadget vote for my mr p we're gonna get taken down by that gadget yeah it's really don't see us winning this game but let's see close to our bars really low probably get jessie down i know she placed his turret and we're gonna get taken down by the slow ah jesse counters more is so so well with that sorry only 14 down we're doing well one shot away from us super see if we can get in sodium time jesse with a slow shot she misses it we could probably get the jessie down nice to be able to chain that off jackie's super low we could take it down as well okay this is looking nice it's looking nice we need to stay alive now we can't lose control okay i'm gonna heal up wait for my long dash and then go in on this jesse able to chain really well here okay i'm gonna go down to this penny i think yep but we've got a lot of percentage only 13 left should be able to get enough okay 10 percent yep it's looking really good looking really really good let's just use my bats to go in with yep nice we're able to chain again everyone going to go down here we just need our sunny to stay on okay go into the final game wow this is tense this is really tense let's see if we can get this off it's gonna be a much longer than a video than i actually anticipated doesn't really matter too much okay they're gonna go same again so i'm just gonna go down probably fellaini i'm gonna wait in mid and then just long dash onto a lane so at least get a little bit percentage baby jackie oh yeah come on jackie you know you want to dance just gonna be hitting me a few times uh oh she's already got sorry i'm gonna get slowed as well this is just straight pain straight pain i need to heal up and then i'll go flank him from behind and he's probably gonna try and pinch me here see penny is a lot we can easily get his penny down so i'm just gonna use oh i dash into the wall twice i'm gonna use my gadget to take her down let's wait a little bit and take down this turret yep okay nice would at least go down the turret but yeah this is my fault 100 not being able to get the first interruption let's see okay just a penny left here okay we're looking good looking good let me just heal up stay in the bush here probably wreck these guys so i've got my bats just gonna chain that off jesse got my bats again here nice okay we've got some control just don't want to give pennies for it and you're really really low here let's wait for my long dash and i should chain really well okay penny one shot let's see if we can take it down nice looking good jesse turret i think that's less slow or a second to i slow got some really good control here again i'll just be going in again once i get my long dash still got another gadget to use so let's just push this penny back don't want to be giving her any control here let's just take it down to try and get out of trouble ah jesse no don't take me down okay really nice we're gonna be probably winning this game here nice nice control for my teammates we're just gonna use a gadget just use everything to take them down that's gonna be a win with mortise in the final game as well wow really brought that back some sweaty games there but let me know down in the comment section below what broader you want to see me use in solo play but that's gonna be it for today's video hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys next time [Music] you", "HQjA-hhDnLQ": "[Applause] cardi b and megan the

telling you that microphone control it does wonders so before we started wrapping and everything we were talking about some uh dying in your sleep [ __ ] right yeah yeah how is it we're good yeah oh gee we're live in the building so you know you know anybody who's else who's done that like i was telling you about um a whole story about like seeing death in my sleep you're the first for that okay so you're talking about experiencing death in your sleep more so more long lines of seeing it and not actually getting there coming back from it yeah like he experienced like dying and then like the post death emptiness it's crazy because like so the closest i've been to that because you know what we've all had dreams where you [ __ ] fall from a building and then hit the ground and wake up and i remember i had one where um i had just started working at this gas station and you know what there was some [ __ ] little uh malandros what's the english word for it uh like like delinquents basically some little hood [ __ ] coming through beefing because they want to buy blunts and i'm like [ __ ] you guys and they're like [ __ ] you and i'm like get the [ __ ] out of this store yeah no so it stays on my mind right so then i have this dream where um i'm working i'm at work i'm at the gas station and this guy comes up and he's like you remember me and like in my dream he was like i recognized him i didn't know where from but in my dream when he walked in the store i like i'm like oh [ __ ] he's here for some for some [ __ ] he's here you know some retaliation type [ __ ] he walks in and he's like you remember me and i looked at him and i didn't say [ __ ] and then he pulled the gun out and [ __ ] um points it to my face and and shoots it and um you know in my the first because you know this was one where you know i've been like injured in my dreams but i've never been like killed in my dreams so he points it yeah yes oh yeah no no no no so i didn't wake up but he points it at my face and [ __ ] he says you remember me and then [ __ ] boom i hear the gunshot and um [ __ ] goes black and i remember like it goes black but i remember like all right it goes black and filling myself like fall over you know what i mean like you know i got shot in the face [ __ ] goes black and i feel myself hit the ground boom i remember fill it all black filling myself hit the floor and then it kind of just like became like a heavier sinking like i hit the floor and then it was almost like i sunk into the ground like cliche yeah and i kind of just like felt this like you know i wasn't seeing anything there was no visuals but i felt like you know you know that um the g-forces when you're [ __ ] falling you know so i hit the floor felt myself hit the floor and then i felt like i sunk through the floor and then i just felt like i was falling it was all black felt like i was falling and then i woke up and like you know what i mean all the dreams it's like you dream about things that you really want to happen you're excited and you dream about things that you hope never happen it's the subconscious you know then that's not a dream that's a nightmare well well yeah no no and this is one of those things because you know what every day in that [ __ ] gas station my normal life i'm [ __ ] arguing with people i'm denying people for certain things i'm talking [ __ ] and it was something that just weighed on my conscience where like you know what i denied this guy for something and he came back with a [ __ ] gun pointed it at my face and [ __ ] no you think about the [ __ ] you hope never happens and you think about the [ __ ] you want to happen but if you think about that it's like some final destination [ __ ] just like yeah yeah yeah just like you know every time i'm on a plane like us as humans you know i'm on a plane and we're taking off and in my head i'm thinking about like dude imagine if this [ __ ] just like engine blew out worst case like we do that we think about that in your car yeah yeah driving around with zach then i am flying in a plane no but even then it's something that like we think about you're a good driver no but but it's something that we it's something that we think about like you know what worst case scenario you have to take yeah i could i could hop on a [ __ ] less than the worst case yeah yeah you know what i could hop on a [ __ ] merry-go-round and then be like imagine if a [ __ ] meteor just came in you know it's just something that we're talking about you're hopping on america around what happens if you slip and break it exactly and you know what and just like zach and just like zach just like what you were telling me earlier about going where we went and about the hypotheticals and this and that and i'm like dude well i could say that about anything oh i'm never gonna hop i'm never gonna hop in a car yeah i know i'm never gonna i'm never gonna hop in a car why because we could get [ __ ] crashed by another car or i'm never going to walk outside because i could get struck by lightning like it's one of those things but i get it this is this is more serious why because it has a negative connotation and for every action there's a reaction okay so think of this every man makes a conscious decision to make a step forward and make a decision to do whatever it is they should do whatever it is but that man also has to be willing willing ready and able to accept the repercussions of sentences you have to be aware that it can happen to you you are not invisible what goes up must come down but you are not invisible so something that we see as not anything out of our church cautious out of our jurisdiction as we're zach doesn't come from that jurisdiction although he's not stupid but he's not as easy with it as we are boom all right right there so at the same time we're all right look look all right no look i would i would agree with what you're saying all right so at the same time guys at the same time guys think about that where's the line drawn because i get it we should anticipate and think about what should happen but but mine was drawn when i decided to trust you no no no no but i'm saying i'm saying like you know what you know what because you know what did you forget right right but what i mean it's like where's the line drawn why because you know what we should um expect the unexpected we should be cautious but you could but you could be so hyper [ __ ] paranoid that you're crazy or you could just be like you know what this is a possibility that i need to consider where's the line drawn because you could be crazy and paranoid or you know or you could do what you do and just be like you know what i'm new to uh so you're like okay so i'm aware that there's these risks let me create a system around these risks brother you your risk you walk out the door you take it exactly so the thing is like certain risks that's why i'm saying because what risk yeah this risk is in a category the risk is they're all going to the grocery store as a category green you know what i'm saying yeah this is like not real and then going to the trap house is like a category orange to red yeah i get it that's red that's it yeah yeah i get it i get it but okay all right so say you know what grocery store code green right right uh trap house code red right yeah all right all right so in comparison all right so all right all right so so yes being as you are the category read you know just in a life sense like oh no i've been in the category read a thousand times and i know you know the best thing you could do is like what it's category red so i'm just not gonna do that no no i'm gonna [ __ ] get what i need to get but you know i i just have to i just have to understand that i'm in the category read and be maybe hyper aware check it you want what you want ain't nobody gonna tell you no different just like me i want what i want you ain't gonna change my mind ain't nobody gonna stop me zach same way difference is where hard knows about it our [ __ ] is firm yeah he's like we don't have to do this and i'm like no dude jack's not firm as long as he feels comfortable from what i see", "Ua4TTyC-gSo": "no absolutely and i need to do one last thing because this thing is finicky for some reason now what your coffee enema so do you know what an enema is well honestly i i i kind of know what it is so we're going to work this out together so an enema is like if i i i could be totally wrong but it's like a douching for like your butthole that have different like sense like oh you could get the uh the [ __ ] um lavender enema so a coffee animal is just like an absurd animal you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah yeah no it's like a butt wash isn't it yeah yeah okay and enema is yeah it's where you like stick a hose up your ass and you [ __ ] fly it's like the douche for the butthole yeah you stick a hose up your ass and you flush it with water it's the ideal thing you need to use when you're about to have anal well i just tell them everybody should have anal whoa whoa whoa you're talking what did you just say everybody should have okay zach you just had some wild [ __ ] let's object and we are not gonna just blow past that no we're gonna address that you just said everybody should have anal yeah what do you mean by that everybody should take a [ __ ] dick in the ass no no no no no no everybody should try anal i'm gonna take my time now why would something so [ __ ] absurd to come out of your mouth why should every everybody should no we're we are not glossing over this why should everybody try anal [ __ ] because you know what go ahead tell me this is the show experience did you just hear him y'all y'all heard him because everybody should get shot in the head one time because that [ __ ] you gotta know that's just [ __ ] up anal sodomy zach you don't think dude all right so obviously i already know that you don't you don't think about what's about to fly out of your mouth but did you really mean that when you said everybody should experience something up their [ __ ] butthole did you mean that because i know you let [ __ ] just come out of your mouth but did you mean that no not that because while you say not that but that's what you said no but no i didn't mean a dick up their ass i mean they should try sushi and calamari no you said anal i s what i meant by that what did you mean by anal because anal only what i meant by anal is like expand your horizons no you said anal no no no not not everybody should be a receiver that's not what i'm saying okay so what did you say you said everybody should try anal exactly so you're contradicting yourself i'm not saying to um take a dick up the ass i'm saying to give a dick up the ass no everyone's trying anal means everybody getting [ __ ] in the ass and you know what no you're not getting away with this one no no we're doing this conversation what oh you everyone you're like you're on the podium you're oh no no that was played that was blatant no zack what do you say everybody should try anal there's only one meaning yeah and what is it everywhere is your trial so are you taking the dick or giving the dick everybody should put a dick in an ass or everybody should take a dick in the ass everyone should try anal means a dick going into ass and i'm already not okay well here's the thing not everybody can give i am happy to hear you justify yourself alright this is gonna be good not everybody can give a dick no no everybody could give dick not everybody could take a dick in the ass you got your [ __ ] backwards no no no i could put my dick in whatever hole that it fits in not everyone could take a dick in your uh uh bro you have a weak argument and i want to hear all of it what i meant to say is that everybody should try anal oh no we have oh no we have we have we we hit the gold mine here so everyone should try no yeah yeah no everyone should try anal until somebody's trying to put a dick in your ass and then it and then then it's [ __ ] dude that already happens not to me i know what happens but everyone not me did you had have you got [ __ ] zach let me let me just run that back so that you know what was said i said everyone should try anal and you said yes and i said does that mean everyone should take a dick in the ass and you know what you said you said that's already happened he said that's already happened not to me has that happened to you there's gonna be a split party there's gonna be no there's gonna be a [ __ ] war and i'm going to be chopping these [ __ ] no it's not so black and white though oh my god zach i want you to die right now pick your words carefully because you will because what it is it's like it's like what is it called the biscuit pisces or whatever the [ __ ] the comparison what is that what is that the best of pisces it's like a comparison circle you know where the circles overlap like that [ __ ] like a venn diagram yeah it's like that's what it'll be like you got people who are givers so all right so i get that zack yeah people there's gonna be this and that but you know what i'm confused by is where you stand in the middle because are you where where are you i'm a i'm a giver of a dick to the enemy to any office no not to any [ __ ] well not to any but to both sex what are you saying i ain't gonna tell you what you are what are you i mean [ __ ] man whatever's clever zack you're talking [ __ ] bananas right now brother i don't care no it's a good content you're all up let's get content was that some underlying [ __ ] right there that was a [ __ ] low blow what's your problem right now i like that he's just like dude what's up you got beef dude like do we need to talk about something not at all but you know what i'm gonna shoot i'm gonna shoot would you shoot right back at you and when you're [ __ ] you know i could tell you like zach you know what it's probably not for the pod but i'm gonna be there you know what [ __ ] this is good content so yeah keep on going on hold up hold up hold up you know what [ __ ] he said jake what's your beef brother what's your beef brother [ __ ] yeah yeah premier premier premiere [ __ ] ass wipe i'm just kidding here hot why is it coming out of just like one side what you're scratching on over here is the top one on the bottom look there's this one pull that one up no look look it's going this is this one and this is the headphones it's only come out after one isn't it well that's uh we're gonna figure that out not right now exactly because you know what right now is figuring out no it's not oh yeah what you want people to watch you watch videos no that's not what we're doing right now it's [ __ ] [ __ ] i guess you're right yeah there there's some missing buttons here i'm i'm confused because like well we're learning it but i already feel like we got a basic understanding it's just like you know as far as the headphone things there's a sound board there's the levels all that [ __ ] so we just got to figure that out and then figure out how to upload and then figure out what we got to put on this one and what we got to put on that one and how that fits and then boom we're good because this one is different from that one so that's already where we go okay so this makes sense so you can have like presets of effects right here i mean this thing is pretty cool but it's just like so me coming from the 12s i know this thing and this thing could do everything that we wanted to do as far as 12 but it's kind of just like you know what if you're a dj at a club especially on some real hip-hop [ __ ] you don't pull up with one of these it's just like dude that's not that's not you're not on the tables you're not on the ones and twos but i'm not mad at this because this could do everything but as far as like you know if we're to be like this will make everything that we want to make in the lab it's good i'm not mad at it but as far as like oh gee hip hop status you pull up with one of these things playing some rock kim nigga's gonna laugh at you for me but it's kind of that old head stubbornness because this could do it all and the the thing that i like about the 12 is that your um your um uh range of motion is way more this you feel how small that that margin is on the 12s you have dots on your on your um [ __ ] and you know where to bring it and then it runs and then you know where to bring it back and it runs and then you know where to bring it back like that's the 12s these that margin is this small you see that margin is this small this is more like for edm djing you want 12 so you want to run it back ah uh you know here goes the b here goes the b here goes the b b b you know the 12s are for precision this is more for like [ __ ] scratching but this can do it all i'm not mad at this this is good we could use this we could make good [ __ ] off this but you don't walk into a fight you don't you don't come into a club as the [ __ ] hip-hop dj with one of these right but it could do it all but you don't get respectful for one of these but don't be mad because this could do it all i'm fine with it yeah i know it's just it's just like that margin of error is so much smaller and when you're scratching you want to know margin of error is bigger oh no it's um smaller if you have a big margin error you have more error to you know come it's a small margin it's it's it's [ __ ] millimeters it's not inches you know from here to that's a big space it's a small margin of error which means you have less room for error big margin error you have more bring it here and you don't bring it all the way and then you kind of bring it here but it's it's a bigger window whatever well if you're if i'm just gonna tell you something you're gonna say whatever i'm just not gonna tell you [ __ ] it was you could have been like yeah but you were like yeah sure well are you you're is that how tired you are that you're patronizing now yeah sure jake yeah no so they told me you would say this like dude i'm [ __ ] being cool like you're so tired you don't trust me like what's happening right now yeah sure yeah yeah they told me that you would say this i'm like oh god i thought we were cool dude like [ __ ] all right no jake it's just a margin of error is like i'm not wrong go ahead if you have a big margin to bear you have more room to make mistakes or no my interpretation is that there's more area for mistakes all right a margin is a space if you have a big margin you have this much space and time if you have a [ __ ] tiny margin there's small room for mistakes i have a bigger margin of error which means it the window's big if it's small i can't yeah the margin of error is so small that i can't [ __ ] it up right so [ __ ] stop arguing what you're saying but here's then what would be the how big the space is for the error um depending on what you're doing this for example i don't know what i'm saying is what's the word for that because i thought that was well it's it's a source of measurement i thought that was the margin is how much how how big the space of air is that's what the margin is no no no you're saying here's here's the space there here's the safe space up to the point of the error it's the threshold it's the yeah that's what the margin is no what i'm saying is yeah here's here's you you you're you're get past the thinking of the threshold of safety i'm talking about the actual red zone margin of error yeah i'm talking about the red zone i'm right there with you continue yeah what about it what about it you're talking about a safe place no i'm talking about the red zone the margin of error if i have this little disc so if the if the error zone's bigger if the red zone's bigger than a smaller red zone right because you could have you could have us like a buffer zone no don't do that no we're talking about the big and the little continue because now you're talking about don't lose it so there's the big and the little what about it all right so the big red zone versus the small red zone if you have a big red zone you have much more leeway no no yes yes think of it like this think of it like look no think of it like this because you're wrong and i'll tell you why you're wrong and i know what you're talking about but you're absolutely wrong think about 2k when you got a jump shot and it has a big green window and and you there's the window and you are this thing passing by and whenever you decide to hit it you could hit it here here here but it's all in the window if the window is you have to hit it right there if the margin of error is big then you could hit it in more time without it sounding so bad but if it's tiny you have to nail it the bigger margin error gives you more time well here's the do you understand well here's the thing the way that we're thinking of the this this is the the structure of this no this is a matter of fact this isn't a theory no no here's the thing though that what i just noticed the way that we're structuring this bar is completely different why because it's complete with the way we're doing it is completely inverted no but it's um it's an example because listen because you have this negative zone until the point of green and then a negative negative another negative zone right that's your that's your margin of error that you're talking about right that negative zone then your green zone and then your negative zone again those negative zones are your margin of error about right when you're in the 2k jump meter it is the pinnacle of the prime of whatever tempo melody whatever that makes sense what i'm saying go ahead what i'm saying is your ass isn't making sense you know how hard it is to argue with somebody that's not making sense and then when i tell you what it is you tell me i'm not making you know how [ __ ] you know how much it makes me want to rip my hair out it's just like dude i'm telling you facts and they're just like you're not making sense anyway i'm just like oh yeah i know yeah i'm [ __ ] huh yeah say it again all right maybe i didn't hear it right so look we could we could [ __ ] do without because you're good at being extra look wait wait wait wait there is a margin of error emerging to vary that defines the window that you have all right so all right there is hitting it right at the perfect time right right and the margin of error is being either a little bit early or a little bit late but still within that window and the bigger that window is the more probability you have absolutely see how you just structured this this this argument you have a little bit and it works for everything wait that's you how you're structuring it how i was structuring it was completely different and wrong i was and wrong also different and wrong is it wrong yes and i'm surprised that you're so [ __ ] smart i'm surprised that you can't wrap your head around what i'm telling you right now honestly because i always thought about it like this way all right oh my god wait wait wait wait you have a pool you have this much time to hit a shot or you have this much time to hit a shot which one's [ __ ] better what is the probability higher on if the rim is tiny you're gonna [ __ ] miss more if it's big this is simple it's probability but no that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about the way i know that's not what you're talking about because that's what i'm talking about you're talking about some other [ __ ] i'm talking yes i'm talking about the um i had i had a completely different idea of where you have this clear space this this this safe zone and then where it's an air point and then another safe zone basically no there's the early there's the perfect and there's the late that's what you're talking about right no that is what don't tell me no because that's what you're either all right so there's the this side there's the perfect and there's the this side there's the ernie there's the perfect and there's the right instead of the perfect invert that the perfect no so the perfect also has no no a window where whether it's like it's still a green light right but there's the perfect and then there's a early green light and a light green light right this come this th this complies to every thing that you're trying to explain to me when we're talking about timing i guess you're right yes it applies to everything there's the early there's the [ __ ] green light early the the perfect the green light late and then the white light okay this applies to everything okay as far as timing i get where you're saying that that's the margin the margin of error if it's bigger you have more leeway to shoot an early shot but it'll still go in if the margin is small you have to hit it on the head smaller margin smaller probability bigger margin bigger green window more likely you're telling me that the small margin is the better one no i want a jump shot with a fat green window a fat margin because i have more time to get it either early green perfect green or lit light green before i get to white so how does that transfer here again to anything as far as timing all right i hit the brake early i hit the brake right on time i hit the brake plate i shoot right on timer it applies to everything as far as time on on that what on that now transfer what you're talking about back in the morning what do you want you want me to scratch it into [ __ ] words what do you want what are you asking that is scribbling you're like all right that was good but uh do it on here now i'm like what is that yeah yeah well there's this and there's this yeah yeah i don't know what the [ __ ] you're asking for me um never mind how was your [ __ ] that was just a lot of unnecessary waste of time for sure man you're so smart i don't get how like you know you're just like no jake you're wrong and i'm like dude this is like you [ __ ] here green eggs and ham dr seuss red flash red fish blue fish this is all of that and you're over here right now jake the smaller the the better not like that no that's not what i was saying are you still sticking to your guns because i oh go ahead i want to hear what the [ __ ] you have to say what i was saying we were talking about the margin of error so stay on that right is that the measurement of the error zone the measurement is irrelevant there's the bigger and the smaller how big it is and how small it is doesn't matter the fact is that there's a big one and a small one so the measurement doesn't matter this boils down to probability uh all right you're really not you're just yeah you're you're just really not getting it and it's [ __ ] pissing me off this [ __ ] right here no i want to hear what you have to say like what is your justification because it's going to be [ __ ] it's yeah tell me please do do agree with me or no anyways no it's not a kind of no it's a yes or no no tell me why because oh my god i am waiting to hear this [ __ ] so what are you looking for i'm right here [ __ ] talk to me you're looking around like you're gonna find the answer on the floor talk to me so um he looks at his watch no no you wanna you wanna tell me i'm wrong uh yeah he's like what no [ __ ] no i want to hear this [ __ ] it's just like it's just like look this is what it what i'm feeling right now it's just like when i'm walking my best friend he's blind oh dude there's a street right here and he tells me there's not a street right here and i'm like dude there's a street right here i could see the street you can't see the street and he's like there's not a street right here and it's just like how are you going to tell me that you can't see there's a street right here in here like no there's not a street right here i'm like okay oh yeah okay cause the answer is here you just got [ __ ] goggles on like no i'm not i didn't make this up the answer's right there and you're like nah nah like what the [ __ ] no no no no no all right so so probability the margin no not probability the margin all right big and small yes all right [ __ ] 82 bro go ahead the [ __ ] ignorance oh [ __ ] all right so what i'm trying to say is that the margin of error is the space of where you [ __ ] up yeah yeah the margin of your [ __ ] up yeah and if it's big you have more room to [ __ ] up right zach this is a simple fact if the margin of error the space you have to [ __ ] up is big you have more space to [ __ ] up if you're thinking about it in terms of 2k no oh my [ __ ] no this that example refers to everything in life well give me an example of when the margin of error is bigger you have less time please [ __ ] tell me this this applies this is a time thing it applies to everything well oh if it's 2k then i i could still hit the shot but if it's life thinking of this linear bar and and the progression i'll continue then okay so if it's 2k then yeah okay so continue because i want to hear this [ __ ] i'm thinking like this is how and how much many things you could do based margin of error is self-explanatory the room the time the space that you have to [ __ ] up i'm thinking of more like something in a different situation like say like well no if it's a different situation the margin of error varies but it is still that the bigger the more time you have in the smaller the less this has nothing to do with timing i'm thinking the margin of error is like say like you break it has everything to do with timing you say you're breaking into a building you had you could you could talk to the wrong person you could blow up your whatever all these things that's not the margin of error that's bad decisions the margin of error that's a part of the margin specifically uh correlates to time i think i'm talking about the window of when it's early i'm talking about to be a little bit more dynamic no you're not talking to the margin of error is time it's what you're referring to well oh you talked to the wrong guy you blew your cover no that's decisions the margin of error but it's not the margin of error that i'm referring to the margin of error is based off of time when you do something early perfect or late well then what margin of error is universal for all situations no what you're referring to is decisions the margin of error mean no look look the yeah it's an error but when the margin of error the margin of error refers it is um it's a measurement how do you quantify that it kind of error in your measurement uh there's there's a mistake in a plan you have a plan there's a mistake margin of error is like you know too early just right or too late margin of error it's it's a measurement of time and that's all i could tell you've been implanted right in this building right as like some you know some worker and the boss that you didn't know knows everybody by face and by name there and that wasn't told to you and you you you you just like walked by him and he's like hey who the [ __ ] are you in this like some high security place right you know and then you get [ __ ] so what's the probabilities in all these situations you know that you didn't know this guy that you're gonna run into him right so yeah all that you know there's all right so that that right there is like you know what you weren't informed walked by the guy because you weren't told that's misinformed okay let me tell you this once again when i'm no no no it's not it's not it's not it's not it's not well in this context i'm talking about the margin of error means that there's so many more dynamic kind of possibilities that could happen okay now i know what you're saying now i know what you're saying but that is um things based off of uh decisions information and when i say margin of error it it's a moving thing margin of error is this and it moves it's not decision because you know what i didn't have to talk to that guy in this case it's more 2k no in this case no no no this margin of error [ __ ] applies to everything as far as margin of error it's not a decision oh they didn't tell me i was misinformed walked by the wrong guy that's not the margin ever that's an error but the fact that it's not a margin of error is because you didn't know and an error that you didn't know you did you did something you didn't know you were supposed to do that's not the margin of error so the margin of error look look look yeah let me simplify it the margin of error is a window in every sense okay margin of error is always a window as far as when it's early perfect or late that's what margin of error it's a window of a a moving time okay when i go when i don't go i'm early i'm late margin of error is a window that's it that's it so when you're scratching this thing and you have like this margin of error so you have okay so now all right yeah so you're right so this and that's how it applies to like a different way because margin of error is like this idea this thing everything but error yeah yeah it's actually error yeah error margin of error yeah so it's just like less excited over here yeah less um uh you know your [ __ ] um turning radius is smaller because your wheel is smaller your wheel's bigger you have more of a radius you have a smaller table small radius you have a 12 bigger radius right you have more control more dexterity over the fight yeah more leeway i understand that yeah more leeway it's like those little attachments that we bought for the sticks yeah it's higher up because you have a bigger radius same thing the margin of error is bigger you you could um move slower and more precise because i have a bigger radius and we got into this whole ass conversation when this is the smallest thing smaller table faster scratches bigger table floor scratches yeah gotta fight with your ass every [ __ ] time but um yeah now that we [ __ ] ran around the [ __ ] planet yeah we agree and and we both knew it is what it is but you want to [ __ ] tell me you're you're the blind guy and i'm like zach wait there's a street here and you're like there's not a street here and i'm like dude i could see you can't see you're like there's not a street here and i'm like all right then well how about you [ __ ] walk into the street then and then i walk you across the street and you're like there was a street there jake and i'm like yeah i [ __ ] know that's what i've been [ __ ] telling you and you're like thanks jake and i can't even be mad at you i'm just like you [ __ ] classic this is the funny how funny it is to be like a blind man's trying to tell you that there's not a streak i'm like dude i know you don't know and he's just like nah i don't believe you and i'm like you want help or nah and then he's just like jake i knew there was a street through the whole time i'm like what the [ __ ] are we doing trying to help you you're making it real [ __ ] hard right now [ __ ] yeah that's [ __ ] well that's what he's being a pain in your ass yeah i'm just like exactly too smart to be [ __ ] giving me this heart of a time on this [ __ ] that you know you got how how's it making the smaller the margin the better [ __ ] probability you have i'm just like dude what kind of [ __ ] dr seuss backwards twilight zone do you live in no the bigger the [ __ ] window the more time it's just like no and then you're gonna tell me i said that [ __ ] you so i was saying the whole time don't you dare jake that's what you were saying i was trying to tell you the bigger the better no [ __ ] you you were telling me jake well think about if this happened no no i don't want to hear your example it applies to everything and then you're going to tell me i was saying what you were saying i'll fight you right now bro oh [ __ ] you promise bro i'll slam you through your whole [ __ ] yeah i [ __ ] would cross my heart hope to die yeah you know i like to i like to wrestle a little bit there that that makes me not want to wrestle you ah what i need to smoke you sad [ __ ] i got it from your mother it's hereditary your mother was a sad [ __ ] i got it from her what are you doing are you re-going live what are you doing what are we doing what are you doing i'm not too sure i want to figure out how to use this [ __ ] equipment you know what i just remembered would you just got a falafel sandwich in the kitchen oh that sounds really good it's creamy you know what i just remembered what the ovens on oh god yeah that's actually like yeah you shouldn't be that calm when you realize that but uh you know what i just realized that the fire fighters are outside we're gonna die like oh [ __ ] don't sit down it's too late we're done for it'll be fine it's it's not like anything that's in there you got the armies doink on you yeah let's just turn", "gvA29aK6X18": "yeah yeah yeah how was it ain't [ __ ] did they put you to sleep nah i watched them do it they cut your nuts out i couldn't watch it i'll be like bro i don't want to even know what's happening just do it i tell you how you got a vasectomy is what you think yeah exactly there we go but so you got snipped yeah why first of all what made you decide because you could just pull out or you could wear condoms or you could just get snipped like that that's the biggest thing my pull out game is weird it's weak so weak that is hilario look you know what i respect you for for keeping it a buck because you say you know what my pull out game is weak because when when when i'm in those guts i'm gonna blast i am sorry i'm not blowing it back out like no i'm gonna finish it it's nice and warm in there i was with my wife so it wasn't a thing but we had the first child we had that's what i looked like yesterday all so [ __ ] high bro i don't smoke like that and it goes in the podcast quiet as [ __ ] i was like the man's talking about his balls being slid open show him some respect i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry yeah i ain't worried about that it's been years there ain't no respect left in that so you you um did you have how much you had to pay your child my first child my wife had when she was 16 years old she gave birth on her 16th birthday i was 19. so i went from swinging dick to slinging brick i had to make my dough did whatever i could make i had my days where all i saw was [ __ ] money signs in my eyes and but i got you know where i'll solve pills to a pregnant [ __ ] because i gotta get mine and you gotta get yours i was i was savage and i think about those days and and i i feel bad yeah no i did i [ __ ] up [ __ ] i [ __ ] i turned i turned um i turned the valley victorian into a [ __ ] theme and i didn't give a [ __ ] and why because i was getting paid i was a kid and i look back on it now and i feel bad because you know what i changed that this [ __ ] was going this way and i [ __ ] sold her some drugs and then her her projection just turned and went this way and i didn't give a [ __ ] because i had paper did you twist her arm don't you know what okay maybe i shouldn't feel so bad you shouldn't because you know them stupid shirts they wear shoe your heroin dealer or shoe no you're right you're right [ __ ] children because if your children weren't taking the temptations will always be there right the temptations will always they were told not to do yeah you know that was on her and i remember bro it happened immediately it happened immediately i only graduated yeah you don't you don't you don't want you don't you don't want to get your masters in meth for sure yeah don't graduate some meth yeah i know the commercial but back in the day you should be a commercial where they used to but like some reefer madness anti-drug [ __ ] right they blame their parents and they'd say i learned it from watching you all right so that's basically the principle i did that sounds like an excuse to me yeah i would watch you [ __ ] up yeah and know that that [ __ ] wasn't right so why would i want that or do you even attempt to try that if it's [ __ ] you up like yeah oh gee my dad was a crackhead and you know why i'm not because my dad was a crackhead it's not i'm a crackhead because my dad was a crackhead no i'm not a crackhead because i [ __ ] saw that [ __ ] and now yeah no it's either like no you you don't follow you learn from your predecessors you feel me that that man [ __ ] he was he was not himself a different person and boils down the quality of life do you want that quality of life you want to be strict to something like that well you saw your father go through that or do you want your quality of life to be better where you're going to say all right that ain't the road i want i'm a shy and you know what it depends on the person too because you know what the [ __ ] that i went through seeing my dad beat the [ __ ] out of my mom my mom being deported my dad being a piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] smoking crack [ __ ] us up you know what i mean it's it's like you know what that [ __ ] could have [ __ ] me up and made me anti-social and sad but you know what it didn't it didn't and you know what it could it could to some people so it depends on on the person and thank god that it didn't because it could happen that and you know what as far as the drugs and the way he thinks and the abusiveness that shit's hereditary i always told myself oh gee i never want to be like my dad and you know what as time went on i couldn't i i just saw more and more how i'm just [ __ ] like him the man that i told myself i never wanted to be like i i couldn't it's important but you're but it's crazy because you know what growing up i always told myself i i you know that i had a lot of animosity hatred in my heart for my pops um you know me and my brother no because he was yeah he was [ __ ] he was a piece of [ __ ] to my mom you know my grandpa my dad's dad had to raise us because my dad was on his [ __ ] that he couldn't raise his own kids so his dad had to raise us until until my grandpa [ __ ] died and you know what that [ __ ] [ __ ] it made me hate him and you know what i i had that hate in my heart for so long and you know what that hate that [ __ ] takes a toll on your mental on your body oh yeah and you know what i hate i hated the world and i was mad at the world and i i spent a lot of days crying a lot of days being mad until i couldn't anymore yeah and i couldn't it was it was it was it was [ __ ] me up and you know what i i i you can't treat everybody like that because not everybody did that and i realized that you see the same thing and i realized that everybody and i realized that because you know what og when i was living this [ __ ] up life as a kid going to school oh you smell like cigarettes yeah [ __ ] that's because everybody in my house smoke cigarettes and oh from that's a small detail that's yeah all right so for me and you know what you know like cigarettes your parents smoke too yeah and i'm like yeah what the [ __ ] do you want me to tell you i'm a [ __ ] kid and yeah they [ __ ] chain smoke in the house yeah yeah it is what it is and you

willing to sacrifice herself it's a nice comp that we complement each other nicely that's cool yeah and i need it just like zach bro this [ __ ] the way that we are it's good because you know what when he's [ __ ] flipping out on the simple [ __ ] i'm like dog it's just this simple and he's like jake you're right thank you and when i'm not giving a [ __ ] he's like jake this is what you got to do it's one of those it's the yin and the yang you fill me with this together perfect word and i yeah i need people like that in my life because if it was just me i would be living under a rock not giving a [ __ ] bro i'm just a real type of dude man i call him how i see him if i perceive it i let it be known and i don't pull no punches you ain't got to like me i'm good with it yeah but that energy the people around you that vibe you know you know it helps brother it helps you know what i mean just like you know for example this is uh it's not it's it's like how this went i didn't ask you to come approach me you peep me you spotted me you said yo what up man you look like you are a person i said i don't know depends on what your imagination is and what you thinking all right personally yeah the candle was burning i came over sweating some gas on it and boom that that candle heated me up and then boom it just yeah that [ __ ] just keeps on going zach i don't like this nah man this is very depressing sleepy elevator music no wonder you're passing out over there come on man this is like life yeah bro go crazy put on that beat from you already know you already know he got a beat request you better play his beat request i love that song that's a good song you already know from who i don't know i just listen to music the name of the song is you already know no that's the chorus you know it's it's a rap song i forget that i forget you're an old head og he's like i don't know what the name of the song but i'm going to sing it to you and find it for me yeah saying it i gave you a couple no bro my auntie my auntie so like bro every time we be getting faded bro she's [ __ ] she's awesome fun [ __ ] auntie single oh it's just what you already know already did nothing and nothing of interest trying to think of what else is honestly gonna be prep click fat tick tock one i bet you that's it i'm gonna probably be passing out [ __ ] this is yeah no that's cool kick it in the living room for a little bit because we still got something i [ __ ] hate to talk well i see tick tock it just makes me believe that like people just have no dignity like your body did you do that on purpose or did that just happen that just happened that's even better man no it makes me angry bro no they [ __ ] get money for this [ __ ] dude they got tick-tock famous yeah i heard people get paid but for [ __ ] this dog how sad is that why because they get all these my mother yeah yeah yeah like how do they know when it starts paying like no because there's there's definitely a uh a thing for for youtube for example like after a hundred thousand views boom you start getting monetized and you make so much based off of there's views there's how many people subscribe to you yeah [ __ ] are getting paid for i know they're excited for talking to a camera bro yeah ain't that what y'all trying to do yeah yeah but in a different kind of way not in not in you guys like a howard [Music] look at this look at this this is this look at that do you like that like just imagine his name is somebody walking you watch what they're doing i think it's a little bit different no yeah it is a lot of people no and and let me tell you oh gee conversation is it feeds the soul conversation is [ __ ] one of the biggest things in life in general from relevant themes to expressing yourself so i'm gonna keep doing this i'm gonna i'm gonna stand up real quick no conversation yeah oh yeah yeah no conversation it's huge yeah right i don't mind because you don't matter but anyway but this [ __ ] is flipping bro you gotta slick rick the ruler yeah i love it but yeah oh gee the conversations that's just like you know something that you know it does so much for people you don't know how something um you know for example i came out here alone don't have people and you know what never have had people in my life that i could really like [ __ ] pour my heart out and express myself you feel me it's just been that way i've got accustomed to it and then boom when i have somebody a homie somebody like you that [ __ ] looks me in my eyes and listens to whether it's me venting whether it's something that i'm excited about or you know something cool in life that [ __ ] does something to to the soul brother that should does something to the soul and you know what it it it it's healthy helps you look at things better all that [ __ ] just like when you're working out you're you're frustrated you're pissed off all the time and then you start working out and you're so tired and exhausted every day that the little things the the car's cutting you off you're not bothered as much no it's it you release [ __ ] and then you could be more poised and relaxed of a person you feel me see i i'm a firm believer that everybody has suffer some may be good some may be bad some may be useless some may be so important to you you never even know it but you won't know until you put yourself there to receive that information you don't know if it tastes good until you take a bite oh again it goes back you can look like [ __ ] but you don't know until you you try it goes back to the book in the cover man just that's it it's all connected oh gee it's all connected i believe it is there's no coincidences there's [ __ ] they have reactions you know what i mean you're having a bad day and you know what i get some good news and i'm so happy and i'm so happy and you know what oh gee you're a close friend of mine and you see me so happy michael pastorelli passed away yesterday oh well now

the guy anytime anybody passes it's always a sad thing i can't show you the tattoo just yet but i'm willing enough to sacrifice a section of my body because i believe that he was important to me and when people are that important to you and they touch some type of string that not just any teacher no you don't do that for anybody nah that's not something you do for me that's my little brother man

guys bobby here and today we have a very special new series for you guys so what we're going to be starting from today on forward is one time a week we're going to be facing a different north american pro maybe we will expand when we run out of pros to face but for now we're going to be facing one north american pro and it is going to be gun game so how gun game works is that every single time you get a kill you are supposed to promote to the next tier now we don't have guns in brawl stars but what we do have is brawlers so as you guys can tell obviously this is sorted by rarity there are different rarity so we have trophy road there's a good bunch of trophy road brawlers then rare then super rare and then it goes on and on and on legendary until you reach chromatic now it takes seven different wins in order for you to move on because there are seven different tiers once you win seven you are the winner so how this is going to work is i'm going to be facing a pro on brawl ball backyard bowl the reason we're not doing the 1v1 map is because it's a wide open map and every single brawler pick is going to be the same here's going to be picking the best brawler for range and damage and all of that and it's not going to be you know very diverse or very exciting if i'm going to be honest so we're going to be doing backyard bowl whoever gets the first kill is going to win if you get a kill you can move on to the next rarity if you don't you stay the same rarity that you are but you can change brawlers we're going to be facing og it's going to be very epic we're going to get into it make sure you sub leave a like do all that and let me know if you guys like this type of video if you do obviously i'm going to keep doing more of them but let me know what na pro you guys want to see next so i'm going to hop into the game and let's get this going okay so getting into the first game here it looks like og is going to pick dynamic and i'm going to go with brock now brock has a lot of range that's kind of an obvious pick um og really likes it looks like he's going to be hiding behind that wall i'm just going to move this ball out of the way since i'm probably going to be playing more in the mid oh gee is kind of just moving around you know doing his thing he's really focused up i want to get as close as possible to him obviously i know he's definitely using fidget spinner i don't know why i jumped back like that i probably shouldn't have gonna jump forward now he's gonna use that fidget spinner like i said he would and it's pretty even right now i only have one jump left and my jumps are really important he's going to hit me over there his super is really scary we definitely don't want to get hit by that super oh no we got we gave him to him this is not looking good for us if i'm being honest right now we're just going to focus these shots make sure we don't get hit by anything going to jump forward hit him with two shots over there he's one shot okay still nothing now we don't have our jump which is kind of toxic oh no oh god oh god this is getting pretty intense gonna go for a shot i'm gonna be able to get my super i'm gonna try and scare him oh i'm not scaring him very well okay he's kind of trapped back there i probably should have went for that and gone for the one rocket shot didn't end up going for it gonna go for a super over here gonna hit one okay i only hit one gonna get another oh i thought i had it there i don't wanna let's go and we're gonna be able to get the kills that was an intense minute and a half we're gonna end this one and we're gonna move on to the next game okay so we took the one to nothing lead so og is going to stay on trophy road and we're gonna move up into i believe the rare column okay so we have barley rosa poco or primos this is pretty interesting so we have two tanks over here if we're looking at the common i believe he's either going to go colt brock or beau maybe 8-bit because og's kind of wild sometimes maybe barley might be the move i'm not too sure i'm kind of thinking barley i might be doing screeching solo poco actually that might be the strap because what i'm gonna be able to do is i'm gonna be able to gadget myself and go really aggro with the heels i feel like this is definitely the best one hopefully he doesn't go a tank the only tank he can really go would be bull so i think i'd be pretty well off so we're gonna ready up we're gonna go into it hopefully we're able to beat him this one's gonna be really intense so let's hop into it and let's see what happens okay so we go into the game and he's gonna pick m so really good pick by og you know kind of just preparing for the tanks uh barley would have been a good pick on my end i think he does have the counter to be honest but i do have the screeching solo his super is gonna be kind of useless i feel this is a really big poke battle over here um none of us really want to give in i feel like my super is more important than his so i might tank a few shots over here he's doing a lot of jukes over here with that wall okay we're each able to hit one shot he got two ticks off of his shot though i'm gonna back up i'm gonna use my gadget and go really aggro okay i'm only gonna get one hit over there he's gonna get a couple so he's in a really good spot i wanna get a couple more hits here before i go aggro again going to be able to get one over there he's also going to be able to get one so he's really close to a gadget for sure or not a gadget sorry he's really close to a super he's got to be like one shot off there we go he's able to get a super so he's thinking about going aggro obviously i gotta heal up because if once i go behind this wall over here he's gonna be able to trap me with a super and get a lot of damage in i can't let that happen this is gonna be a really tough win for me over here uh moving back not able to do much again trying to get another hit og's playing this really passive i can kind of tank a few shots because he already has super so he's not really gaining any value besides the damage that he's doing to me i'm able to get one hit over there okay i'm one shot to super i don't know if he has damage or heal on pretty interested by that gonna pop my gadget gonna move back so i only have one gadget left i gotta be aggro with that one gadget oh this is getting kind of sus we're just going back and forth i'm gonna play a little bit more aggro here move to the side he just has slightly more range in me it's so toxic he has slightly more range and slightly more damage he's going to be able to hit that shot i need to get my hit or my heel we're like two minutes into this game i don't even have my super oh she's just staying back gonna put up the sad face gotta hit this shot come on if i use the corner it's more likely to hit him faster there we go we're able to hit a shot i'm gonna go into it now gonna use that screeching solo he's kind of trapped oh i'm not able to get the kill though can i hit him no i'm not able to hit him so i'm out of gadgets i have nothing to do here oh this is getting kind of intense 13 seconds left he's got a super again i'm three shots off of super i'm gonna heal up fully no [Music] he's looking really good right now i need two shots to get super i'm just gonna run back over here i'm gonna try and fake him out got him he's pushing me into this corner this is where he wants me to go so we can get that kill i'm just gonna go up this is so i have no clue what to do over here i have absolutely no clue what to do i need to get my super but i can't trap him he's just going to be able to run away because of his super i don't i feel like there's nothing i can really do he's getting me into this corner over here i think i just got to try and stay alive and then maybe pick barley next game he's getting really aggro he sees i'm also getting aggro though oh no he baited a couple shots over there this is where he's gonna go in i'm gonna use my heel one two three oh my god we're both so low come on i'm healed nope hit him he's trying to beat me into using my shots three two no i almost had him but he's gonna be able to get the win so og's gonna take that one we are both going to be on rare now so let's hop into the next game and let's keep it going okay so here we go into the next game so he's gonna pick barley and i'm gonna go with rosa i'm gonna switch it up i'm gonna try and connect all the grass i had a feeling he was gonna go with barley uh just because that's kind of like og style a little bit more passive not really a tank player okay i'm gonna go forward gonna charge a little bit of his super over there unfortunately but it's whatever it is what it is going to connect some grass over here to try and get as close as possible not going to be able to do anything he's just probably going to keep his distance like he should be doing obviously um this is getting a little bit intense here i'm pretty low oh i think i got him i think we got him oh he has the slow down really smart pick over there by og for going the slow if he that's so toxic now i'm not gonna be able to do anything i'm gonna get this ball out of the way i think i gotta bait out all of his slows there's another one so he's only got one left 45 seconds left he's only got one slow oh he got me pretty low i gotta back up switching grass switching back kind of just faking him out i'm basically full hp at this point he's playing it really passive which he should do since he is a barley and i am a rosa he's kind of just trying to chip me down gonna switch grass gonna try and get closer oh he caught he catches himself in a bad position trying to beat out a gadget i can't do anything this is pretty rough i won't even like charge super this game i'm just gonna be able to get a kill at one point og's kind of trapped over here but he does have that wall i don't really like that wall if i'm being honest he's gonna use it there we go that's gonna be his last gadget now that's what we wanted to do over there we wanted to bait out that last gadget really badly this grass has been helping us a lot actually so he's got to wait it out do what we can he's really chipping us down nicely if i'm being honest okay we chilling trying to do as much as possible we're gonna put up another grass he's probably gonna shoot near him there we go i'm gonna be able to fully read jen so you gotta try and get him trapped maybe in overtime we can do that um i can't really juke because he can just automate me once i get close enough to him but he doesn't have his uh his gadget left oh did i just catch him i thought i caught him i think he caught me nope he's the one that caught me no and he's gonna be able to get the win so that's gonna be it with this one he's gonna be able to move on to the next year so i'm gonna go into the next game and let's keep going okay so we're gonna hop into the next game here i have been inspired by og so i'm gonna go with barley it looks like he's gonna go daryl so i'm gonna try the same thing as he does so just you know chip away now unfortunately the difference between daryl and rosa as tanks is that daryl has super and rosa super would be useless um he's probably going to be able to win this one to be honest he kind of has that counter on me but we'll see how this goes he gets his super oh this is not looking very good at all i'm going to be able to move behind this over here gonna take that shot it's going to hit see if i can get that hit off over there gonna be able to hit him come on okay he's hit let me go again no he's able to juke that one gonna hit og over there oh missing no okay that one hit i got so lucky with that one again another hit gonna shoot this right side he's getting chipped down pretty low over here he's kind of stuck he's probably gonna go for a play kind of scared he does i don't want to go too close obviously he's going to go for a roll i'm going to get him kind of stuck this should be game right here there we go that's going to be game so i'm going to tie him up we're both going to be on the same tier two wins for me two wins for og let's hop into the next game and let's keep going okay so now moving into the next here we have the option of daryl penny carl and rico so looking at it i think carl would be the best pick because it counters the most now penny would be kind of annoying i think we're just going to go with carl because carl would be the best choice gonna go with the speed hopefully he goes rico i would like to see him go rico or daryl um penny would be pretty decent and then carl i don't know i don't know why i didn't go with carl the first time probably because he thought that daryl would counter me the best um but yeah carl is probably the most well-rounded pick probably pretty easy as long as you play it correctly i assume he's gonna go with two he is going to go carl so we got a carl v carl matchup over here hopefully doesn't take too long i'm gonna go for my first shot obviously we're both using the same star power i'm gonna be able to hit him one time he's gonna be able to hit me twice let's see i'm gonna just back off try and get to that full hp he's gonna be able to hit me twice again it's pretty interesting over here gonna be able to hit him twice he has four total ticks and i have three total ticks it's six to get the super so he needs a double hit right here in order to gain his super he's one shot to super now although i don't think super really matters too much in this one i'm not too sure he's gonna be able to get it there yeah so he's got his super if he goes on to me i think i'm just gonna be able to get it and kind of just pickaxe or not pickaxe sorry roll away which would actually be better for me oh i'm really not able to hit my shots here this kind of suss he's hitting me really well going to go for a nice carl like shot over here he's going to be able to work me down oh i'm able to stay alive okay i'm able to stay alive over here we're both one shot so this is kind of awk um gonna try and bait out a shot not gonna be able to oh he really hit me there are you serious okay i'm forced to back up i got no play over here because he hit me pretty even at this point although he's definitely had like the advantage um you know no one's been able to really get a kill obviously he was pretty close that one time i had like 200 health or something we were both one shot trying to get my spin over here oh i thought that one was for sure gonna hit trying to just get it uh we're both trying to do the same thing it looks like i should be able to hit that how did that not hit seriously oh i'm gonna be able to get the kill and survive with 24 hp shout out to kobe but that is going to be it i'm gonna move on to the next tier so again let's hop into the next game and let's keep going okay so moving on to the next game my options here are going to be piper pam frank bibi and nani so we have a lot of options right here um so he can go oh wait jackie's a super rare oh i saw would have went jackie i didn't know that okay so i think we're gonna go with piper just because i two shot basically all of these except well i two shot two of them and then the other ones i can i think i can just curveball down or should i go with bb i'm gonna go with bb because og hates bb i love bb and i gotta prove it's a superior brawler so let's get into the next one and let's keep rolling okay so here we go into the next game and he's going to go penny so it's kind of a game of the brawlers we love but are pretty trash um so i'm just gonna get literally just gonna get hit by that first shot pop gadget and move forward gonna back him into a corner one two oh nope oh my god oh my god i almost died there no way i almost missed that shot and he would have been able to kill me but i'm gonna take the 4-2 lead that was just simply an out comp and we're gonna go over to the next game and maybe i can wrap it up soon and get the w let's move over okay so now moving on to the next one we get to choose between mortise tara mr p max or jean or sprout okay so he's still stuck on this tier um okay so what i'm thinking is okay so daryl would be very bad against mr p but that's the only brawler that would be bad max is a solid pick gene is a good pick i think i'm gonna have to go with gene i would be a scammer if i didn't go with gene if bobby bs did not pick gene i would be an absolute scammer this is literally the only time i'm ever going to use spirit slap do not use spirit slap worst star power in the game dev team please make a better star power for gene but let's hop into the game and let's keep this rolling okay so we're gonna go in he's gonna be using jackie so i was gonna pick mr p until i realized that jackie was also in that tier um jackie's a pretty strong brawler obviously counters mr p i have two knockbacks so i'm gonna be able to hit those knockbacks when jackie tries to speed on me gonna be able to finesse one shot over there but i gotta wait for him to go out of the grass not gonna be wasting my uh my shots obviously i could get a kill here i think if i hit a blind pole that's not really what we want we do have our spirit slap now spirit slap obviously is very strong does a lot more damage if you hit three shots oh just playing this one super passive gonna be able to hit a shot over there gonna be able to hit another one i'm gonna go for this gonna back him up i'm gonna scare him off gonna be able to get that kill and there we go gene for the win let's move on to the next brawler let's keep going we have two rarities left okay so moving on to the next tier it is going to be legendary i have two tiers left he's still basically at the start well he's more like in the middle he's got a lot of time to go so he can choose between any of these brothers on the screen right now minus piper and then minus the top row um spike gets countered by jackie carl could get countered by daryl penny so we're not gonna go spike i think hear me out guys i think crow might be the move definitely not going leon we're gonna go crow the gadget is just way too strong for defense carry on crow is the play let's hop into it and let's see if we can get that win so he's going to go penny so good thing i didn't go spike over here i think leon would have been able to get us this win so we just got to chip it down basically get our super and then jump in with our shield he's going to be able to get that hit off already we don't want him to get his mortar once he gets his mortar we're kind of screwed but he's going to play passive until he gets that mortar so it's kind of like a double-edged sword over here he does out range me gonna be able to hit two shots over there that's a pretty good start for us i'm gonna play a little bit passive over there gonna pop my shield one two three oh no he's gonna be able to get the win if i hit one more shot i had it but he's gonna take it so he's gonna move up tears finally five wins for me three for him let's move on to the next tier and keep going okay so after looking at the brawlers there's a few different options here but you know i can't go crow because it gets hard countered by bb pam frank b and piper and there's no way he's going nani i can't go spike gets hard countered by too much so i decided to go with the worst brawler in the class and i'm gonna be going with leon so it looks like he's gonna go b so not a terrible matchup for me um i gotta just focus on the jukes i suppose maybe use my clones to get closer when i say focus on the jukes i definitely don't mean getting hit by the second shot he takes or the third shot he takes so this is not going very well over here but i think i'm going to be able to get the edge i'm going to be able to use my clones to get closer obviously so let's move forward with that he's going gonna take two shots to get rid of my clones he's not giving me any value whatsoever he does have his gadgets as well which is gonna be very toxic to me this is gonna be difficult this is gonna be a pretty hard one to win if i'm being honest i kind of just gotta chip away he's not letting me chip away oh geez being toxic he's playing like classic og not much i can do here um again i just gotta try and chip down at this point not much i can do pretty good shot over there by me gonna gain a little bit of value gonna push up a little bit he's gonna be able to hit a pretty good shot oh i gotta back up able to take out his first gadget i still have two gadgets he has two gadgets i'm basically saving up until i get super i think his super is pretty useless in 1v1 my super's okay i'm playing pretty aggressive he's to run out of that 3k shot he's going to get it right back oh that one shots me i got to hide so i'm just going to go into hiding over here he obviously wants to use his gadget and kind of pin me up against the wall i'm going to focus on the jukes here and just auto weigh my shot instead of focusing on the shots he's only got one 3k left he's gonna miss it i can get a little bit more aggressive now i'm gonna pop my clone he's gonna go for a shot on me not gonna be able to hit anything he's thinking about using a gadget i think i'm a little bit over halfway to super he's got that big shot now it's kind of scary i gotta run back able to hit a couple more shots over there he's gonna go for his super again like i said his super's not really that great he's still got does he have that 3k i don't think he does anymore i'm chipping again towards my super oh he does that's kind of scary pretty close to the 3k kind of just chilling right now or not the 3k sorry the super once walls break although over time b is probably the best brawler in the game i think i'm gonna do perfectly fine with leon he's gonna put that gadget down oh did he really hit me with that rigged okay i'm so close to super i've been chipping all game for this moment i do not want to choke this moment he's gonna try and stay as far away as possible trying his hardest not to give me super i just gotta auto aim and chip him down i think he's starting to panic a little bit gonna put him back towards his own corner good jukes over here and i'm able to get my super here we go we're gonna go invis we're just gonna follow this there's gonna be absolutely nothing he can do and we're gonna be able to get that dub so that one's gonna be a little bit difficult but we're gonna get the w and i'm on the final tier so let's move on to the next game and let's keep going okay so here we go we are moving on to the final tier so we can pick any of the brawlers between b nani bb piper frank and pam and i have any of these brawlers any of these three that i can pick i think i'm going to be going with collette i think i should use shield because i don't want to push them back i want to keep them in position and then obviously i'm going to be using this gadget because i don't really have an option so i have six wins he has three i guess it's the first one to win seven 1v1s but let's hop into the game and let's see what he picks he's gonna go with max so max is obviously an extremely annoying brawler i hate max but if we win this game we have the dub if og ends up winning this he's gonna get the dub k i think he picked the wrong brawler by accident so i'm just gonna give him the ball i'm gonna go let him score and we're gonna run this one back i don't know what he's gonna go but i'm gonna stick with collette because colette's definitely the best 1v1 maybe serge could be a little bit better but surges you know he's a good brawler when you're kind of working with his tiers but it doesn't really work out in a 1v1 that's kind of like sudden death because there's really nothing for you to gain uh you can't really be leveling up all the game because you know you die once and it's over so you're basically a level one surge versus whatever so let's see what he goes he decides to go piper now this is kind of toxic since he saw what brawler i was gonna pick surge would have been better specifically for this 1v1 oh this is so toxic he outranges and out damages the only way i kill is if i just chip him down and i'm able to get my super somehow okay there we go that's one shot so it's 1-1 i already got him in a great position i wonder if he's using curveball or not i feel like he definitely is i should have kept him trapped i don't know why i didn't oh this is basically all juking i have to really outplay him in order to win this one which i'm not sure if that's gonna happen gonna be able to hit one shot over there he's kind of backed up oh he's screwed i'm just gonna face tank it and that is going to be it i'm going to be able to take the w and that is going to be it for the video so i hope you guys enjoyed very awkward place to be doing my outro i'm just going to stand in the middle of the map that is going to be a thank you guys for watching if you guys enjoyed the video and enjoy this series let me know leave a like do all that i guess i'm idle oops but that is going to be it you guys know what to do i'm going to end the video there and i will see you guys again tomorrow peace", "OaZg7_F0_Co": "hey there Stevie jeepers mister you scared the creepers out of me how would you like to take a break from that fine dirt based wall and learn about building boy would I where am i mister why you're an alpha Stevie alpha whoo now alpha building started all the way back in 2009 by filthy casuals who had just discovered minecraft but it would be a long time before normal people would make anything decent now people make a mega structures every day wow I can't wait to make a house of my own whoa whoa whoa hold on a second there Chuck patches agree on that's right Stevie five years strong builder patches agree on is here to take you the rest of the way actually it's just Korean if you want to get better at building you'll need to learn the five B's of building build break block borders and build and remember building is a skill of creativity talent and most of all plagiarism if you can't build just download something off planet minecraft and pass it off as your own that way all your friends on the server can call you out and tell you what literal trash you are and remember the more time you spend building the less time you're outside exercising okay so there aren't five B's of building please do not take that seriously it was a joke if you didn't get it there are however five things that I do want to talk to you about which I consider sort of five universal rules and themes that you should incorporate into every building and the first one I want to talk to you about is palette now palette is the colors that an artist would use on paintings but we use the same word to describe the type of blocks we use on a building and as you can see I've got a fairly normal one here using cobble wood and log and that makes a fairly simple house I tend to use this quite a lot because these colors complement each other the beautiful thing is people choose blocks that work together on their own we sort of have this in harren art nurse about us that would not enable us to create something using dirt and sponge and everything else but there are some more complex palate tricks that you can use that would improve your builds most of you for example may not have thought about using colored clay as a roof and more importantly you may not have thought about using colored clay in conjunction with another colored clay so I here have a list of different colored plates that work together a light color and the complimentary darker color and I can turn this green one into another one with the pinks and the purple and it still looks good because those two colors complement each other although the palette doesn't quite work with the rest of the build because those complement each other it doesn't look out of place however if I do change it to a different set of colors like a green and a pink it starts to look a little bit odd because those two colors don't quite work together so choosing colors that work is really important when you're doing a build and I can give you a bad example by showing you what it's like with some light colored clay and a dark colored clay just using well that it here to change it up so as you can see these colors really don't go together although some of you might with a more abstract I say actually it looks kind of nice I like it but again it's up to you and here's a few more examples like all the sands will work together the quartz box kind of work together and that's something that you know inherently all these stone brick blocks work together I myself am no expert on color and I'm not pretending to be but everyone knows that this palette isn't going to work that is exactly the same house we started with at the beginning and all I've done is change the blocks that we've used and as you can see it's awful in comparison I don't think anyone would say oh that's actually a really nice house you'd think Oh what is that so palette is a really simple thing that everyone does but it is something that you need to consider as well if you want to achieve a very nice build back at the first one you can see that using very simple blocks I've achieved it and even than the second one I'm using a different set of blocks but at least these complement each other in some way unlike the last one which is just an array of random blocks okay so that kind of covers palette one of the more boring bits and is fairly easy to do so next I want to cover depth and I go one about depth all the time and I just want to show you what I mean just in case some of you didn't fully understand so some people's side of their house may look something like this completely flat and you see all these little connected textures they really don't go together they're really abrupt changes that really are displeasing to the eye so what I want to show you is how we can just add layers along the side to improve the way the house looks so I'm just adding an overhang using exactly the same block as the roof just to give that one little layer of depth on the roof and already it's starting to look a little bit better and then I'm gonna go round the back and add a layer back a block so we are utilizing three layers of block here in the depth so that it gives that extra level of detail I'm going to do it for both the top and the bottom there but please note that I'm not touching the frame that is the log blocks because that's the sort of precursor that's where it sets the gauge of where everything else is if I started messing with the frame then perhaps it wouldn't really display where the Det starts and ends so the frame tends to be in the middle so now I'm back at the front I start knocking out whoops I start knocking out all of the sides of the house where I've just created some depth leaving that frame one block in front and that's really important because what this allows us to do and is probably the most important thing about depth in general is that we can now add detail to a flat wall you can't add detail unless you actually integrate it into the wall itself and it would still be flat so now we have a little bit of depth we can actually do something with it so I'm going to add an underside which we couldn't do previously to the overhang using stair blocks and once I've done that it's already quite a small improvement to what was initially just a flat surface but what we can also do is now that we have this extra layer we can improve our framing and we can add these beams and these structures to the frame itself and those holes that it generates actually allow us to have these segments which we can then detail that this is about depth or not detail so I'm not gonna do that but you can see that I am continually placing the frame and it just improves that depth layer even more so that's kind of all I wanted to show you with that is how you can turn a flat wall into something that has depth and I'm not changing any of the blocks all I've done is utilized three layers instead of one so hopefully anyone that didn't fully understand depth before will get it now next I want to move on to something that I've never really mentioned before and it's quite difficult to describe lots of people have struggle with this because there are no set rules and that is scale so here I have three pretty much identical houses from the start of the video but each one has a different scale now this is the original here and as you can see this is kind of a normal sized house it's not actually very practical because it's one block inside but you can see in relation to me this house looks pretty good but if we go inside we see that it isn't practical at all because their shape is off is that any other but that's not the point but if we go and have a look at the smaller scale one it's so small that it might as well be like a miniature model it's not really practical at all so you have to weigh up practicality by your scale and then at the other end of the spectrum we have the biggest one which is pretty good it's like a good size it's very big it's a lot more work but what this essentially does is when you make something in a large scale it means you have a lot more to details so although our house is now a lot bigger you'll notice that although I used exactly the same style blocks everything except the scale it means that there's just a wider range of space which isn't detailed and that's some of the problems that we face when using scale now when I talk about approaching the of figuring out your scale I don't really have any set rules that will make sure that you have the right thing every time because it comes down to what you want your bill to look like if you're doing a miniature build your scale is gonna have to be smaller if you're doing a grand city you're gonna want it huge I see a lot of people that try and make a really good-looking town but they build their houses too small or they build the Town Hall too big so the scale doesn't match up all I can do is give you some round advice on this one take a look at what it looks like in real life whatever it is you're building and see if you can match what they've done that would help you bring scale into focus into reality when you're trying to do it blind sometimes it's really easy to mess it up and that brings us on to our fourth one which is planning now I made sure that scale was before planning because scale is integrated into planning you need to think about your scale before you start so I'm just laying down a base foundation planning is very important and it's very simple it takes two or three seconds and an ounce of creativity so although it looks like I'm randomly facing these box to make a base I'm actually thinking about how big I want it to be what size want it to be where I want the front door to be I'm trying to plan ahead and I'm not trying to think of the grand scheme of things I'm not trying to picture how the house is going to look at the end I'm just planning what I want the very basics of this house to be so how wide is it how tall is it my frame actually dictates exactly how high this is going to go on the first floor and speaking of frames that's very important at each corner I raised the columns up and connect them at the top and this dictates the overall shape of it and I have completely planned the first floor but planning isn't just a straightforward array of just randomly placing blocks you really need to consider everything and this is really difficult one of the key skills you're going to need is visualization and to help you do this you could actually look at a few pictures of fantasy art buildings or real-life buildings and they can help you visualize what you need to make in-game I often did this before I was confident enough to go freestyle so it really helps to just take a bit of inspiration from other people especially when you're trying to work out what your house is going to be but hopefully you can take all the other things that I've talked about today the palette the scale and the depth as you're planning and then we're kind of done planning the very basics of this house we could take this anywhere from here and that brings us on nicely to the very final thing that I want to talk about today which is shape and this takes into account all of the other things I've been talking about this is going to be incredibly difficult for me to explain and convey but hopefully I will help you in some way if you struggle with shaping when you're planning you will need to come up with not only a shape for the house but individual shapes for detailing now this might seem a little bit odd but hopefully you can see as I've developed the frame of this particular house which by the way I'm kind of doing at random but at the same time I'm planning each part of it you'll notice that I have four different parts and one way to make it look really nice is to have all four parts of the house look different and bring something new to the bill now I'm not saying this is the best way to take every single build because some buildings need some symmetry which is also fine but you can see I'm rotating around this build constantly I have a central spire but I'll pause right now you can see that there's a bit on the left which is a bit more empty there's a bit on the right which is raised higher than the bit at the front which has a right angle each bit is slightly different and that's really key on this type of build where I want the house to have a lot of variety and again it's all about visualizing that shape in your head as you're building now to save a little bit of time and this has already been a fairly long video for me I'm just gonna skip ahead to when I've completed the entire frame so I can get on to the next bit and now I want to talk about how you can plan and shape with your roof I've talked about roofs in a previous build school video and you need to decide when you're planning what kind of risk tile you want I for the sake of this video I'm just going to use a very simple 45 degree angle stair roof that you'll see on most typical houses especially like the vanilla in the village now in terms of planning for this stage all you need to do for this stage is decide what part of your plan is going to have a roof and which parts aren't it's fairly easy and for the most part you want to take the bits that I am like the bits that jut out and add a frame on them and I don't do the full roof all I add is the overhang because that really helps you visualize the rest of the build and I'm just gonna skip ahead so you can see like which bits I chose on which bits I didn't choose to add a roof to and as you can see the planning and the shape really came together now that I've got the frames and the overhang together just by looking at what I've got there you can almost picture exactly what the house is going to look like and this is what I've really been trying to drive home in this last bit but have perhaps not quite managed to explain it properly I really hope I have and from here this is where it becomes incredibly easy you just fill in the rest with walls and the rest of the roof and then you detail it and it's done really visualizing and reproducing your vision is the key part of what I'm trying to say for this final part of my Universal building tips and just to prove it and maybe to prove to you that you can visualize what this would look like I will just fill in the walls and the roof and kind of show you exactly what it would look like in the end and there we have it it looks like the start of a really nice sort of Victorian house and it all came about because we thought about the base we thought about the shape the size the scale what blocks we were going to use and it accumulated into a house but is eventually going to look good once it's got a bit of detail behind it and that's kind of what I'm trying to teach you these basic concepts of building I'm not trying to show you block by block dimensions but four dimensions people always ask me hey how big is that how would I place this and this and this and it's like I'm not trying to teach you that what I'm trying to do is improve your building skills in your building knowledge and I'm trying to get you to be more creative I really hope this video has sort of cleared up any inconsistencies throughout my videos or maybe the things that I brush over a little bit too fast and have really gone into depth from these very five key features of buildings there are way more to talk about and maybe I'll address those in a later video but for now that's all I've got thank you very much for watching if you've enjoyed this video please let me know in the comment section below I put an awful lot of effort into this one more than I usually do I can tell you that thank you very much for watching see you in the next video", "z7ETFHY2Sjs": "say nothing I drink all day

we're going to be playing some more brawl stars on my channel and we're going to be doing the very first ever jamming on my account by opening up a ton of bra boxes today now I ended up buying the hundred dollar gem pack which is twelve hundred and fifty gems and sign up for all stars and if you take a look at the bra boxes it only takes ten gems to open a single one so today we're going to just crank through a bunch of these raw boxes try to unlock some heroes do some upgrades to our different brawlers as well and let's just go ahead and start popping these open right now now how the gem immerse if you guys haven't seen already pretty much you have a couple of options one you can unlock a new brawler and you just get that new brawler which is awesome number two you can get a lick sir you can get like 1 2 or 5 elixir and elixir is used to upgrade your guys number 3 you can get a hero that you've already gotten before which is just what happened to me right there if you get a hero you've already gotten before you end up getting a brawler chip so check it out right here you'd receive chips use chips to buy new brawlers and that blue coin on the very top it just makes it so if you get duplicate brawlers you can use that currency to buy other ones so if I want to buy let's say ricochet I can just save up ten of those chips right there and yeah it gets pretty expensive for spike at the very end spike and Crow are like 600 each if you look at the bottom 600 each for spike and Crow let's just start cranking our way through a bunch of these brawl box boxes right here and see if we get anything good I'm gonna stop I guess if we get on like a new hero which is going to be Jesse that's going to be our first new brawler inside of this episode Jesse's pretty good she's the one that spawns the tourists let's just keep cranking out throughout these bra boxes and it's gonna it's going to be a while opening up the bra boxes I guess the one complaint is that it takes a long time especially with like the hundred dollars impact you have to just keep doing these small boxes over and over and over again I'm going to keep opening these up and then I guess I'll get into a battle in a second just so we don't do all the chest opening at the same time I'll do like I'll do a bra box battle draw a box battle by the way it's gonna take a while for me to not call like Saints cards and call things gemin or I mean we'll know gems are here but calling things heroes and stuff like that it takes a while to get used to brawler's and all the new terminology just like when clash royale came out and so far we're just getting a bunch of repeats we got Jesse which was nice but now we're getting duplicates we're getting a lick sir and after we get down let's do like five more Bravo ceases we'll get into a battle and let's go and do it so finally making our way through three and two and one okay to all of that we got one new hero then we got a bunch of elixir and brawl chips so if you check it out right here let's use our elixir to upgrade our people so using one elixir we can upgrade pocos super I'm just going to upgrade everything pretty evenly right now so we'll do it we'll do like the level one for basically everyone even dynamite who I hate I'm not really a big fan of him let's go ahead and play Jesse and get her upgraded a little bit we'll get Brock upgraded too and this should be enough to upgrade like pretty much all of my brawlers to these level one base abilities that's actually going to be perfect right there and that's going to be it I'm going to hold on to my brawl ships right now I have 22 of those on the very top but let's go ahead and get into a battle right now and why not go into smash and grab using our newest hero Jessie brawler Jessie who is an absolute beast I really love playing people who spawn stuff especially if you guys are new to the game playing someone like Jesse or Nita which I told you guys in the last episode is super good for learning how to play the game by the way I need to figure out how I want to do my setup like you I want to play on iPhone all the time I do I neither like sit down while I play this game because it's really hard to look up and talk to you guys there's no there's really no break point I'm like clash royale and check this out already already have our first turn of the game and look at this Jesse is a monster we actually have two Jesse's on our team look at those turrets going crazy that's going to just obliterate them and guess what I already have another turret going down right now and that's going to be so clutch we have a second turret this is broken guys I told you jesse is so so strong and I think we can only have one turret at a time I'll go and throw another just to check yeah we can only have one turret at a time if you throw another one it kills it and just looking at these turrets destroy Bowl right there this is absurd you've got all this range and they're playing everything all three of their brawlers have shotgun so they can't really get us from distance like they would have wanted to I guess I just played like an idiot right there but fortunately the second jesse is going to pick up all the crystals that I dropped oh and then that actually Jesse was going to die oh no oh no we just gave up our entire lead right there guys we just gave up our entire lead David crystals now we need to control this crystal mine or else we're going to get rocks let's see if we can do it okay Jesse's gonna go in on that Shelly right there oh man they're gonna play really scared because they don't want to lose their we obviously I need to build up my HP again so things don't get crazy on probably their Shelly is gonna play offensively and then the rest of them are just going to chill I'll play oh wow they're gonna go in right there let's kill him he has seven crystals trying to kill him right there we're getting them so low but it's not going to end up working Oh killer Shelly oh we just got that Shelly right there this is so close right now but look at this oh he's at 45 he ended up dropping the crystal I can't get too close to that Shelly go guys when people come out what okay I was about to die right there if we ended up losing right when people come out of base they're invincible which is really really good so if you like even if you kill someone with crystals near their base they're just going to respond and then take all your stuff because they're they're invulnerable or whatever all right looks like we have six crystals we're holding it down we have turrets we have everything going in the center we want to stay near our turrets right now actually all that Bulls gonna die look at all these crystals right now look at all these crystals I'm at 12 on a 13 of these I've got two turrets on top of me I don't even have to go near anyone I'm just gonna go ahead and start sniping from a distance another turrets going to go down right on top of that bull and that is going to be the end of it guys our newest brawler jesse is a beast and that's going to equal anything easy victory for us geez well played alright star player not to brag we're going to pick up that little achievement right there not too bad we're gonna get a couple of trophies and like I said super easy to get trophies in the beginning and rank up your brawler which gives you 20 gold each time you level up which is awesome and let's go ahead and go back to these brawlers chefs or brawler boxes guys chest boxes same things let's keep crushing it through these and I guess all we can just go through these all right well Barley's going to come out we're going to get a bunch of duplicates it takes you know it's sort of interesting how they did the progression in this game it's actually really simple obviously you just get gold and like gold is the free-to-play version and then gems are the you know gems are the pay to play version it's pretty easy Oh ricochet that's going to be the newest brawler we're gonna get ricochets got sands favorite brawler and checking him out so he shoots that he's like coal except he can bounce stuff off the wall he's really squishy though he only has like 500 HP which may really tough for him to try to stay alive so looking at the the brawler's we meet still we need goal who is inside that last one we need mortis okay and the rest of those are rare I'm really hoping to get Bo Bo has always been my favorite brawler inside of brawl stars it broke Bo's just awesome at $70 chips it's going to be pretty expensive but I feel pretty good about unlocking Bo let's just keep grinding through this elixir rate you're gonna get another poco and obviously when you get a more rare brawler it gives you more of those brawler ships massive keep grinding through we're going to keep getting a bunch of elixir and crushing it let's let's see I wonder exactly how much money it takes to max out in this game so you can max out by first of all getting 15 of the brawlers there's only 15 in the game right now but then also upgrading their stats I wonder how much it actually costs to upgrade the stats inside of brawl stars let me know if you guys know in the comment section below we are still crushing it with these bra boxes so many of these to open 5 elixir inside of that one that was a good one right there and we're gonna get more de status an epic brawler right there mortis is super cool he is one of the few like he's a really unique one so he basically dashes around his attack is a dash and that his special is a bunch of bats we're gonna play mortis in a moment I'm going to open up a couple more of these broad chests but that is so cool we got mortis that's awesome that we got him because he's number one super rare and number two he's super super fun to play so crushing it through just a couple more of these making our way down to 500 gems and we'll stop for this one woo alright we're going to get polka we're going to get Brock we're almost down to 500 and then we're going to put mortis into action we're getting a bunch of elixir for us to use which is great for upgrading our guys one more right now which is going to be another piece of elixir and let's go in upgrade mortis we'll go and do a bunch of upgrades to him we got ricochet as well so we can upgrade ricochet and then I guess I don't even play ricochet that much but I'm gonna let's start upgrading a few of these that cost two elixir and let's do poco poco is awesome I love poco barley is great as well and just slowly but surely making my way through we'll spend all of our elixir time to get into another battle right now this time using mortis who is going to be so much fun to show to you guys I haven't actually played against another mortis yet since I've been playing this game no one has played against me with mortis no one's played against me with beau or spike who are three of the rarest brawlers I did play against a crow actually I think we did inside a video to check out check out more to start here so your attack is a - which is super good on this because we can just run so these crystals right here we can take them and it's really hard for them to deal with us now obviously a really really risky brawler just because the fact that you always have to go in super close if you want to damage people so I usually just like dancing around with mortis and then trying to do damage from there see like how we cut through right there which is really nice you got 400 right now we're saving like we're holding on to the crystals right now which is great and look at that we're just cutting in and out over and over again and it's making it really tough for them to deal with now we need to get back up to full HP and we need like all of our people around us oh that's going to be good with the bear let's go you go in with that bear right there look at that damage we're gonna put down we've got six gems or six crystals right now so it used to be called gem mine this mode or gem tab that's why a little tough for me Oh check out these bats oh I threw the bat I ended up missing because the guy had already died with seven eight crystals right now guys I need to run away from the Shelley the Shelley's gonna wreck me this Shelley is chasing me down right now look at this Shelley but Shelley's gonna get smacked in the mouth we have eight crystals right now I really need my teammates to come through clutch I don't really want to be the one getting this last one but I will if I have to I'm just going to stay close enough to dive in in case it comes to art if it pops out on our side now it's going to pop out on their side so look we've got another bear out right now which is so good for us let's go until the Shelley oh we're gonna get that next crystal right there I'm gonna get all ten crystals for our team we are carrying the team as mortis right now guys let's go and get this next crystal just for poops and giggles alright looks like we're at 11 crystals everyone's chasing us down but no chance they're gonna end up being able to kill us I'll let my HP go back up a bit and we're going to end up going through Shelley's it looks like she died to someone else anyways GG well played and that's the power of mortis I'm super happy I did an awesome match to show you guys mortis in action because that is exactly the way you play it you dive in and out over and over again picking up the crystals as you see fit and we played that one perfectly we're actually going to have one of our events reset which is nice and let's just go ahead and get into some more Jemmy right now we have so many of these to open all right I'm just going to keep on crushing it through these we got an elixir elixir these ones just keep going over and over again I'm hoping we can get one more brawler today if we could get I really want to get both our bow but I know that's a little bit more I know that's a little bit greedy to ask for whoa the clap you know the clasp rattle God's never loved me but the brawl star gods do bow my absolute favorite hero inside of Raw stars we're going to end up getting him and he is going to be played a bunch by me you guys going to be seeing a lot of bow soon he is just so good so he's the one that shoots three arrows and his special ability is throwing three bombs on the ground which do so much damage against your opponent's it's old it's borderline unfair if you guys watch the oh okay we almost bought something supercell trying to get us to buy stuff if you guys watch the youtuber if you guys watch the yeah the youtuber tournament I played Bo a bunch and I ended up carrying our team for a bunch of those victories using Bo and it ended up working really really well and we're even going to get bowled out of another Wow another one right there so just by just by doing this one gem pack we actually got all of the brawler's except for two of them we have 57 broad ships to which we're holding on to hopefully we don't have to use those on a CRO or spike hopefully we can just get those out of the broad boxes instead of doing this but just a couple more to go we have 21 more of these raw boxes before finally said and done with it let's just go ahead and finish these off before we get into our final battle with Bo we're going to get some elixir we have a lot of elixir guys I'm going to spend a bunch of this elixir on bo2 just because he's so good for using it and let's go ahead and do cult let's go ahead and do barley I'll play bowl inside of another video I actually I don't think I've only played bowl once ever he's not my favorite type of here I'd rather play el primo instead of him for someone who's tanky and as we get to these final ones we're waiting growth and spike are our final two to get I heard that molt actually got spiked with his like xx draw box he ever opened so ridiculously lucky but going through these we're going to get el primo we're going to get another barley two more to go elixir and the note that's going to be the final one right there we are all said and done and let's go ahead and just upgrade both some more bow is a monster I can't wait to show them off to you guys we still have a little bit of a lick sir to spend oops I did a couple too many on Shelley let's just go ahead and upgrade a lot of these guys I'm finishing off with rock that's going to be a for our upgrades let's go ahead and get to another match right now and I'm going to be showing you guys go off in action though is so so good ah it would be really embarrassing if I actually lost with this one after hyping up Bo inside of these you know the last couple of minutes throughout the entire video hoping that we would get them we're going to end up getting inside of this one and let's go ahead and crush it we even have a perfect team to build around though so we've got el primo in the front Colts going to do some more damage from the back as well and check this out we're just gonna we're going to make it rain with these arrows right here and as we build up our special we should be able to do a crazy amount of damage building up slowly but surely we're actually going to miss Shelley pretty badly right there somehow all right we'll get a couple more hits on Shelley right there's slowly rebuilding over and over again oh is actually pretty tanky for someone who's ranged and looks like we're getting close and here we go now we can throw our special and our special is so good so watch Shelley on the top like Shelley on the top hopefully she runs into it Shelley's gonna run backwards boom Shelley's going to run over our bombs right there and just like that el primo has a bunch of the crystals right now and we're dominating this match it just took that one play right there to really set ourselves up okay I'm gonna get shot by a rocket right there that's okay I'll primo has all of the crystals I repeat all of the crystals and we have another special setup and we can literally just throw all of our bombs on top of the gem mine it makes it so our opponents have to deal with it and it's so annoying check that out dynamites going to run over and get blasted Shelley's going to run over it too and get hit we've got more of these arrows going down just making it rain on our opponents almost nothing they can do about it okay well we're missing a couple of arrows actually look at Shelley with those and taking a look ten crystals already guys this is basically going to be the end of it unless they can chase down el primo ni our bombs actually got set off ice back there look at this look at this we're doing so much right now look at everything going down foe is going to be so so good we're going to blast that guy in the face Shelley's going to run forward right into our bomb and that is going to be the end of the battle the match is over wow that was fun beau is just so good guys I'm so happy to bow and I'm so happy to be playing this game it's so much fun if I say so one more time I am gonna just delete my YouTube channel and that is going to do it for this video

defend what we're going to do is we're going to go 1-0 and we're going to trap the ball i'm going to show you in this bot match then we'll do it in a real match by the way it's going to be really hard

then i do the quickie jump what let's try it now finally there's that one square it's so hard to open up that one square but i freaking did it finally final heckingly and then he passes it to me and

did was waste a lot of supers and gadgets great now it broke come on blitz i'm open there we go we scored ah they have shelley we got that one that's all we needed really easy easy easy peasy orange squeezy what how did he score okay okay okay we're setting up i'm in i'm in i'm in i'm in yes yes yes we trapped the ball we just have to defend for 50 more seconds are you cereal they have brock ah

went this is how we went this is how we win [Laughter] ah brock that was not satisfying at all that was only for 10 seconds that that nanny was confused that freaking brock though oh freaking heck they have a colt and a frank for wall breaking ridiculous oh we scored though we good he gave he gave me my super we got we got that one open we're good careful careful careful careful careful careful okay i'm in i'm in don't feed that frank that's super don't feed that frank the super they have no wall breakers this is our game this is ours do not rob this from us we just have to not let them score that mortise what does he think he is huh huh what do you think mortis huh no not not now walmart not now are they gonna score they have a frank they have a primo and a cult ah we're in plot territory now so we actually have to do something we have to win to get out of this bot zone all right they've got colt we have to not let colt get a super up oh my heck that cult is going to wreck us no no no game game over uh they have a primo [Music] we have to somehow score right now this is really hard with two tanks huh spro protected him wow wow wow no we need to score within the first 30 seconds nice this might be the one this is the one this is the one wait for that and then jump no okay they have frank but we have m's we can we have the tank killer now we just have to take care of that frank it's got to score real quick holy heck i like it i got my super they just have to score now nice nice nice nice okay we scored within the first 25 seconds we're good we're good we're good got that set up nice [Music] i'm getting tilted trying to cheese we've been at this for an hour okay this is the one okay here's the one okay we're in we're freaking in um wait no what the heck is going on what in tarnation is happening blitz scored we're gonna set up we're gonna set up we're gonna set up okay jump got it nice we just need to team wipe them that's all we need it's kind of hard

to score on them real quick this is the dream the dream com they can't break the walls down they have nothing against us literally yes and i scored my super this is the one this is the one okay set up there jump we're good we opened it up nice nice nice nice okay set up the jump i'm in i'm in i'm in i'm in 45 degrees you got it blitz yes yes it only took two hours to do this okay i'm gonna i'm gonna go upwards and i'm gonna jump out you thought you were smart bo you thought you were smart we only lost a hundred games to win this one game oh glory we spin come on bo be cool bow be cool bro this bow though he keeps attacking us he's got no chill he knows he's lost so why is he keep attacking us those two hours for this very moment to find the perfect precise combination of opponents that had no wall breakers that we could score within the first 20 seconds so that we could beat them so that we could push them all back so that we can set up our supers and then score for round two where we push them back even more grab the ball go backwards i jump in there blitz pushes them away sprout blocks one side and passes it to me on the other side and all of that time to make sure that we're not one one we're not zero one but we're one zero with that perfect setup where we both have the supers that was agonizing and that deserves code oj until next time i hope you guys enjoyed it because this was ridiculous it may be a glitch but it is the dumbest glitch in the game that is not even worth it i wouldn't even be mad if supercell didn't patch this i mean it happened to these guys and they're probably really mad that it happened and they're they're probably posting on reddit right now supercell fix your game but really it took the three of us two hours to get this perfect combination to get all the stars to align to make this possible oh my goodness that's it for this video until next time stay tuned for more cheesy oj", "z3nJ3xUyqAY": "since the digits will be alone

new york version and we're bracing for the bottom let's buy this up [Music] if you've been following this page for the last few months if you've been following me on instagram facebook twitter wherever i be you've heard me at some point or another mention the fact that my favorite book over the last 10 years has been none other than yahyazi's homegoing masterpiece to me to me to my fellow book club members to all of us we agree line for line character for character style voice rhythm writing story anything you can imagine that you'd look for as a reader she met that challenge y'all did that with her debut novel homegoing and she gave us every bit of life that we thought we deserved and we did and she gave it to us so much so that everyone i read after this book just didn't measure up i was unfulfilled i've been unfulfilled in my reading for the past four years read this in 2016 been unfulfilled in my reading and i just gave up i said nobody's gonna do a trick like y'all did it no one's gonna reach perfection like she did so i'm just gonna wait on her to do it again so i did been waiting for four years for y'all he asked me to drop her sophomore novel and she did she just dropped her sophomore i had around somewhere right here transcendent kingdom like last month and couldn't wait to read it got with the same book club numbers that we read four years ago and we were ready we were ready we were eager to dissect this break it down get our lives restore 2020 and all that good stuff read this book on friday book club meeting on saturday yes did a little late reading was in miami get in my life and don't have no time for books here now read it on friday for a meeting on saturday and my my started this book friday night got to page 131 i remember the page number before i gave it a rest to you know call it a night try again on saturday to complete it by page 131 of transcendent kingdom by yahayati i was left nowhere i was left nowhere 131 pages and i was at the same point that i was when i started uh about 10 pages in i say that to say that this was 300 pages a masterpiece i traveled every single page every single page i turned i went on a different exploration a different voyage different characters different voices different things to learn different things to explore 131 pages in and i learned nothing new that i learned from the first 10 pages let me sum it up i'm not going to go through and critique every single thing about this book i will say this this book failed me transcendent kingdom yagyasi i don't know what happened here such a vast contrast and thoroughness and care and soul from homegoing that i found it off-putting i wondered if she even wrote it i wondered if she was just facing a deadline that she had to meet did they give you an advance yeah and you just need to get the words out so you gave us transcendent kingdom there is such a great disconnect here that it makes me uncomfortable transcendent kingdom lacked nuance it lacked depth it gave me a whole lot of surface i didn't penetrate with characters it didn't penetrate with story john yes he's still a great writer we'll give her that she's the great writer we're basing this off great being the baseline for her but there were no bells and whistles here i did fold the page down for a couple of lines that she made me say okay okay i see you but it just wasn't enough to sustain this as a good story the best word i can describe used to describe transcendent kingdom is soulless i did not feel you yeah in this i didn't feel your care i didn't feel like you cared about any of these characters so i did not i didn't feel like you cared about the stories the drama the trauma so i did not i found myself trying to race to get through it just to discuss it with my book club members i had no desire to read this from a yearning story give me more place as i did with homegoing i wonder if you liked it i do i wonder if yahiasi likes this book what was the aim here this book the transcendent kingdom i didn't even tell you what it's about it's about science and religion and there should be some marriage of these things these two subjects science and religion there should be a marriage of that you'd suppose that there was somewhere entrance in the kingdom but there wasn't this whole book was a parallel of a science exploration and a religious recollection a family trying to figure things out and that's about it oh man such a great disappointment i will tell you this oftentimes when i read a sophomore book or i read a book that really disappoints me i don't want to read anything else by the author but with transcendent kingdom i do with yagyasi i want to read your third book to see where you really are who are you really as a writer where is your voice because i'm confused i'm confused the quality is so variant here that i don't know where to pin you i want to read your third book to see where you really are i'd argue that this book came from someone else came through you to us i said that even when i read it this book homegoing felt like it came from our ancestors this book felt like you are a vessel to tell this story that we all needed to wanted to have to hear and you were just the best to do that and you did it so remarkably so incredibly remarkable this felt like deadline chasing i've been there i know how it feels to just try to get words out on the page this last chapter in this book was cheap you summed up the whole thing tried to give us a little bow to put on it to make it make sense and it still did not i felt this was a great great waste of time i want to ask authors this question are you beholden to deadlines to publishers to fans to audiences do you allow that to compromise the work i'd argue that you should not i'd argue that if you created a masterpiece once and that's your one and done let it be that don't tarnish the reputation in the brand with some crap-ass sophomore lazy ass sophomore novel because it does so much destruction let us wonder let us guess tell us that you don't have anything else for us [ __ ] the companies the publishers the people whoever's waiting for you i understand you have to eat you're an author and you need to eat too i'd even recommend picking up some freelance work do something else until you're really inspired in your soul things to create again because this was cheap i felt played as a reader four years i held out 2020 i did it again with my [ __ ] disappointment transcendent kingdom i give you a c minus because i like you a d plus if i'm really going there i'd even say this if it didn't get the hype for me from everyone from lists and goodreads and everywhere you can find if it didn't get the height i stumbled upon this book as a first read and i never knew you to be masterful i still might not read you again even without the hype i wouldn't read this again have any of you read transcendent kingdom have you also read homegoing what do you think what do y'all do how did she make you feel did you like any character in this book did you empathize with anyone did the story resonate did it pull you did you think about any of these characters once you put the book down was your time wasted was your time fulfilled am i missing the mark here were my expectations too high all of this is possible as you can see this taste i lost with this transcendent kingdom get to know now that i've read that book let's talk about some blood [Music] you checked out my last video you knew that i was down in miami hit up my connection he highly recommended that i review grunts but the rare sought after fruity strain that everyone's raving about tried once once before while i was in brooklyn and i thought it was just okay so when i'm hearing all this hype in miami i had to try it again to see if the screen was any different because you know the strings tend to do that different places different spaces different growers you just never really know what these things get back to new york and decided to do a little comparing contrast with the new york versus miami version and i'm about to do that with you huh right once is a hybrid of skittles and gelato many people refer to it as a true hybrid because you can get some streams that kind of give you a little more of a tivaline you can get some strains that give you a little more of an endicoline and miami the lean was kind of like both sativa in the head and the body i can get with that we're going to check out these colors on this new york version of once first just like miami we have the greens and the orange dark greens likely we have the beautiful crystals again people tend to mention purples maybe i just can't see it i don't really see much of a purple color beautiful nonetheless it's fluffy i really like that i'm biased for a fluffy bud i really just like the touch and the feel and the mental signal that the fluffy bug bugs send me i see a fluffy blood and i feel like oh this is qualified this don't get me high now this could be in my own head but i always make the correlation interesting in terms of smell i will say that the ones i tried in miami definitely gave me more of a sweet type of candy aroma that i'm not necessarily getting here i'm getting green i'm getting tree but it's not as like pungent it's not as like oh that is floral sweetie-ness that i'm about to intake right now i'm not getting that i'm not getting that brain scent connection that makes me want to jump right into it but maybe that's deceitful we're going to jump into it anyway in terms of touch it's not giving me that sticky i got a little stick stick to it but it's not giving me that finger you know sticking sticky that i really like with my butt i'm not really getting that it's kind of two ways that the miami version getting with this one i'm gonna smoke it now to see if the effect because that's all that really damn matters after i mean space smell taste touch look yeah that adds but the feel is what we're going for with the butt so let's give this a try brooklyn royce let's get into it [Music] nice hit airy nice sweet that one might have been a little bit of a lie sweet might have been the anticipation but i don't know don't know that i taste sorry windows open because my landlord smells smoking [Music] i'm really tasting nothing tastes like weed to me and he takes a skittle or right tastes good tastes good i just ain't getting that fruity i'm not getting candy i'm getting nice tasting weed though i mean i'll take it no effects yet third hit no effects yet i mean not even a remnant listen i'm not gonna waste your time or any more of mine um smell touch taste fact look miami wins okay let's talk some [ __ ] you know what's some [ __ ] that we haven't bottomed out yet i feel it i wake up with a feeling in my stomach daily that uh we still haven't meet the bottom i open twitter see what kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] is going on nope not the

forever it's okay this is crazy you can use Gale gene and Tara or Brock basically tar or Brock will be able to open up a hole on the bottom right corner for like seven out of 15 gem grab maps Gail's going to be able to make spring traps to bring them into the hole and gene is gonna be hooking them so that Gail can push them all into the spring trap we interrupt this broadcast for a very unimportant service announcement holiday path is out in the game 480 gems if you do buy this kit make sure to use code OG now before we get into the actual gameplay I want to say this upfront as much fun as obnoxious as this is I think it's incredibly toxic that you can actually do this in the game so I want everyone to see this and I want to make sure that supercell will be fixing this it's ridiculous trapping people for 13 minutes that's that's obnoxious as funny as this will be it's not funny for the person that gets trapped for 13 minutes you try to log back on and you can't get back on that's that's no fun anyways we're not getting trapped we're trapping so that is fun double swoosh works really well they're gonna have to change every single map to remove the coroners you got the four little tiles in the corner the four little barrels oh wow they just rushed straight in Gail set the spring trap for the coroner they don't know why but it's happening all those freaking teamers this is gonna be rough for us but they have seven gems there's no way we're gonna be able to trap them right now oh he's doing it he's doing it and that is that one hole that you can make in the corner that crow jumped out of my way are you serious oh my gosh this is too hard with Tara Tara super takes way too long I'm the greatest it's got to push him in oh my oh oh my it didn't work okay well whatever is come on come on Piper had the super lame she broke the corner where he's gonna words gonna win now that's that's no fun whatever make him use a super we're just gonna win this twenty seven gems Oh stupid Piper ruining our Rick I don't want to win I'm trying to lose right now another thing is that if we're facing any wall breakers any Dynamite's that have jumps it's going to be impossible to trap them so we need to match with like some pocos and some other non wall breakers non jumpers oh they're going straight in again I like it we just need Tara to get her super and we'll be good okay nope I just dropped my snow no no this is too hard with Tara we need to use Brock right now her super takes way too long crocs jump Brock's jump not Brock's super but we can't right now because spicy's Brock is at 900 that's way too high we don't want to tilt this Brock is brought we're gonna start match with 900 they're not gonna fall for it this to hard man this is to hacking hard maybe if Nick had broken his mini with a gadget that could work too let's try this one more time you are dead tick okay spicy toast is opening it up there we go nope alright up turns out we need the power of Walmart with us we're gonna change roles we got we have Brock this time instead of taro slow and steady wins the race I should do another sound effect video I shouldn't that took me hours nubs probably spent like a week on that thing free Jim Jesse there we go to health are you serious oh my there was a Leon in there okay we're ready I don't know why he needs a super for it but he might okay there we go he jumped Oh interesting so it's easier to charge Brock super than it is to charge Tyra super so we're fine why I was the bait and he uses jump though he's doomed oh my gosh all those money yeah it's a freak out of here it's 3 V 2 do not even think you can Leon let's grab a few you know it's fine yeah I need to charge my super though for realsies ah ah that crows is contemplating life right now that is freaking great Mun Jessie do it get in there Jessie wait that Jessie got trapped in there too hold up hold up he frickin tried to jump in there why would they jump in there that's not how that works we're trying to draw them out of here alright let's try that again so frogs needs a super and then we can start hooking people and stuff I just need to hook them so that Gail can stun them into the spring trap we're only gonna grab the gem so that they don't hit ten gems immediately that's all we're not even here to win No please use a spring trap yeah Oh Frick he's just off-center ah I'm a little cheesed right now this is rough no one no one is hiding in the corner okay we're gonna do this we're gonna trap them all before when they get ten gems I'm gonna try and just go on the spring-trap gosh dang it why is this so hard yes yes okay it's 3v2 we can recover from this that rose IV just need to take all that freaking rose a holy shoot she's so tanky right now yes yes yes yes yes yes okay come here come here Rosa okay we just need to charge up that super it's 3 V 2 right now you don't need 3 of them yes yes yes yes yes 3 V 1 the Bono's the Bono's oh no Bo oh no oh no that is so sad Bo we need to make we need to hook Bo before he grabs any gems though he's doomed he knows he's dead to 3 V 1 yes yes okay let's grab eight let's grab me okay we got eight gems now we spin on them oh oh no no no no no that was his chance you could have opened up the walls evil gene strikes again oh my goodness all right now what I don't even know what to do all right we got to get a thumbnail going Oh somebody picked up a jump [Music] nice that's the thumbnail we need to draw this out we need to give them a gem the worst part about this is that they idled out okay spicy you got this one more it one more nice we have 10 we have 10 M you have 10 nice nice nice anyways the worst part about this is that they're BOTS now and for the next 13 minutes they can't log back on because it'll say idled out and still in a game supercells leads to fixes this is this is ridiculous this is this is the world's longest gem grab evil gene has ruined the experience of three other players now what do we wait 13 minutes the game's automatically stopped after 13 minutes and 14 seconds so we just have to wait it out there's nothing to do and they can't reinter the game feels bad for them I feel bad but we're doing it for the video there it's probably the point where they can't reel aughh in anymore because they're BOTS and they've idled for too long [Applause] [Music] match over that is it we drew the game robear's de vida and a hook and a hook Huck a hawk hey a hawk a hawk I'm sorry guys for making you guys go through that but you guys didn't lose any trophies from that we didn't wanna abuse our power too much it's a nice little draw we still got 15 tokens alright that's gonna be for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it that is how you draw in gem grab and it works for half the maps that have for the barrels in the corner you have to use Brock to kind of open up that corner there you need the super for some reason but then you have Gale for the spring-trap and everything it's super fun but it's not fun when it happens against you so I hope supercell does fix this and that's it for this video hope you guys enjoyed it thanks for watching thank you but that is easy code og until then stay tuned for more quality oj", "c9C6t_nNouY": "this is the oldest version of minecraft look at how bland it is it's so old there's no hunger

it's 5 10 now so I'm gonna roughly in this about 520 there's a video response video hopefully you guys can see me I mean I don't know exactly how focus this is I don't really like to do videos like this but I'm talking so I guess you should see me um so I watched a video from BCG RFS where he was talk about the TV show and I like his schnapps us everything like that but I have to disagree on some point so I'm gonna go ahead and do a video response to this this is just gonna be our original season because I do agree that original sister was really good and I'm gonna kind of overlay the plot so you guys know if yes no idea cuz i watched in shiny 5s video and he was like oh I didn't know battle city was and I felt like hitting him like he should stop playing the game altogether I mean Battle City wasn't like the best seasons ever um I know I sound like a giant nerd from this but uh yeah the show is awesome um the main thing that I disagree on him with is GX but that's in another video there's a lot more to talk about in the main season because they're just so good so this video this one I don't know if you can I don't even know where my Heather this video is going to be about the actual UVO series the 2000 series called you you uh season 0 didn't council not talking about that season 0 was terrible if you don't know what it was Kaiba had green hair and he was a douche pretty much it um you know the only thing new I guess is the Kaiba had green hair and Joey didn't have red eyes and he kind of beat people up so it's kind of cool i guess but this is first series TV show so i'll go ahead and get on with it there's I have a stack cards here I'm gonna go through that kind of overlay like what I'm talking about so this is for being recorded in 1080p I something like that so hopefully be actually be able to see what I'm talking about so start with duelist Kingdom duels kingdom was good because bam it started out with Kaiba uh who had 3ds and he was like oh I'm so cool I have three most powerful cards because they have high attack points and no one runs trap hole so since he thought he was the  uh Yugi's grandpa youjizz main character Yugi's grandpa I had one of these and Kaiba was like books it can be used against me because definitely I can't get around one blue eyes by having three I guess no one around Russia also back then either shrink or knee that stuff I like a scabby did anyway um so he's like yeah I'm gonna rip this card in half and you visa like hey the Dark Magician he's my favorite card because he has a lot of unnecessary spell/trap support so yeah this is main characters cards uh continuing islands duels Kingdom out introduces tunes which in the show were the whereas in the movie they kind of fixed it and then actual real life they're terrible um so Tunes we're just basically the creation of paces because Pegasus was all like hey guys guess what I made the game so I'm gonna make some broken ass music so yeah tune so we're terrible in real life they're good you know on TV show uh sticking with a duels kingdom uh you he is playing Pegasus and I forgot what the goes down but he's all like yeah I know how to get out of the black luster  soldier 3000 attack it's really good then you see cards later on in the series a lot so much later on but just you know whatever that should have been you notice favorite card like someone's skull why the hell this wasn't it's got the same attack it's his signature monster just you know one sack anyways I guess I didn't matter because it season one they didn't tribute yay so the next we got crossover cards like black skull dragon cards that you know in the TV show they were supposed to symbolize friendship because look it's my summoned skull and your red-eyes oh my god oh by the way Oh see what did I miss a weevil and weevil Rex Raptor had a red eyes and you thought he was hot  and was like hey I'll play you for cards and got railed by a damn time wizard so another crossover card we got Dragon Master Knight this is actually really good I'm just like really hard to get out blue-eyes ultimate is not good but yeah more crossover cards then we get to the dungeon dice monsters which is terrible this is the only car dungeon dice monsters this type of a judgment ice monster crush card that used in it they were trying to catch on a new thing and it didn't really work it's like a four-episode serious thing Yugi somehow even though he's never played the game for just bosses out of everything Oh Sydney get Battle City Battle City is at the beginning it kind of made no sense and then it started to make sense it's where they try to incorporate the rules of the actual card game into the show and in battle City there was some like in the beginning there was some really stupid ass which irish i really wish i could put in this video but if you go back and watch i'm sure it's on youtube somewhere like he's like Oh summon my summoned skull and summon a beta the magnet warrior and since beta the magnet warriors attacks her electric and summons goals are to wait powers them up x + 2 or some ass like that which makes no sense um so yeah there's going on like that weird ass random decks were kind of put into play like weevils insect deck with parasite pair side which is also when I started to realize that Japanese cars look way vetted in English cards here's a jet here's an English parasite parricide maybe you can see that I don't know where the that goes but you know wiki it here's a Japanese when it's coming out of some boots face so yeah Japanese cars have a better are just in case you didn't know then we get to oh my god my and our tribal has one of my favorite cards to the red Dark Magician except he's insane and tries to cut people's legs off so yeah so we got that then we got more cards that were made to look way better in the TV shows no we're in real life revival Jam being one amazing in the show you could do all kinds of crazy ass  with it and then it came out and then it's like yay underwhelmed uh then we get introduced to the god cards group there there oh my god I'm all-powerful I have all the gods I must rule the world but uh but yeah so the guy cards were made to look over broken obelisk was terrible and he got he was actually the biggest god card like in size so obviously they gave it to the guy at the biggest ego so khabar got that and then bitched about it so then he's like he realizes hey I've got the shittiest one so let's try to get the other one so I try to play you be4 Slifer and slifer's is like the best one because he had you get destroyed anything two thousand dollars which is boss and then Marik's like no my ships the best because it has a billion effects and you have to know a Egyptian to play it because my learn that's the hard way and I just dr. on the floor so yeah that was kind of the end of Battle City I guess then like like also at the end of Battle City we got some awesome badass fusions that took forever to come out and we're not playable in the least bit like dark Calvin amazing healy just like looks the  he's like one of the cool student guards ever and then we got stuff like our canaanite Joker which shook for  ever to come out and it's not even playable so yeah then we also got stuff that just recently came out that should have been banned not come out at all and cards that are completely unplayable without bank cards so that's cool uh then we got the orichalcos thing where my finally comes back and you find out that she's been emo this whole time and I wish I had friends and so she goes from playing harpie ladies like the little that she was too amazoness that doesn't show I'm not lesbian I'll go from having these sexy to playing manly ass I don't know what the anyways amazoness it's what she starts playing so yeah then we got the s movie well what else we got we got some seasons that I don't have for um we have let's see the orichalcos which actually that was good the whole Atlantis thing was kind of but that had some of the most broken cards ever and most broken and my card is like the seal of orichalcos holy um which is way way broken like like VCT RFS says oh i'm gonna go ahead and tag team Yugi and Kaiba on a bad guy and they still don't win for like four were episodes so yeah then again it took them like three episodes to be guys at acting guy that just use mast cards so um then we got the waking the dry LSC I was waking the dragon so we had Grand Championship I didn't even watch that but I did watch a clip on there where they explain how chains actually work so it's going to cool the introduce more of the card stuff into it and a millennial millennium world thing which was like not even card games at all that was like oh I'm Bakura and I'm gonna throw you guys back in Egyptian times then there was a ceremonial battle which is where we finally get to see the gadgets and UV takes down three god cards with some magnet warriors um then you know we find out that the Pharaohs name is a tam and yeah for kids sucks so they kind of sensor to legit if we get the movie which is where we see stupid ass that should never have come out like what upon rare metal dragon why the  would you run this sorcerer dark magic how to upload all um and then the Sphinx cards uh the only thing I remember really about these swings cards is that I bought an exclusive pack and I had all ultra rares and I was like holy i'm the best pack polar ever everybody let me open your packs i want to buy like five more packs of exclusive pack and then I pulled a bunch of Fink's it was like book that's like the happiest day of my life honestly um it's kind of sad now so that may stay my life but it is like when I thought I had the best pulls ever so that is season wash it um I have a ratchet 15 days and GX but uh yeah I want to try to keep these around 10 minutes so um I've been talking to a bunch of people and apparently like when I sum up stuff it's pretty good this time it wasn't really except trying to explain stuff but like movies when I try to explain movies it's kind of funny and awesome so i might start doing that just cuz i something you know on the side to do once I finally remember the password for my old account printing a shadow my start doing that over there so if you guys want to check

mislabeled which you can't do because it's part of the mold it's not like a heat transfer they put on on the label of the tires so that then then went to go to a Ford dealership because they're like you know the nice four Grimm's that you know you get on there's 40 turbocharged cars and lo and behold they didn't have that so then they had to give me brainy wheels out of their stock and they had to upgrade me for free so it was like a huge hassle but I got new wheels out of it so it's pretty sweet Wow yeah so well do you know what locks you know what always talking about ticking is a pleasure so ok wait what happen playing Tekken like all day like I was playing with gamers blood all day um and I forgot the other guy's name shout-out to them and then the entire year popped his ass in there got his ass whooped and then he started talking about I'm gonna make a video I I'm gonna make a video but anyway so I was a I popped out and I was like ok getting ready to get prepped up for this and I said you know what I haven't played in a tournament yet so I wanted to see you know what it consists of so I jumped into an online tournament match and there was a group of like 4 people so I jumped in and then it waited for eight so I got in and um in how the tournament is placed it places you know characters by I guess like they're fighting level so it had me going against I guess somebody that was on the same tier level as I was with that character that I was choosing and so this guy that was hosting it he had to pull the fight money up to 2 million up to too many two million credits I'm like oh well [ __ ] that's cool you know so go in there it takes a while and I'm wondering what's going on well he rearranged everybody's fighting style you can tell that this group because they were talking to one another inside the chat of course I went in that party but you could see that they were talking with one another and so he arranged to where he was the host he went against me because I have a lower rank but that's only because I haven't played with that particular character that much so he thought that he was just going to get it easy win to get to the second round so I said ah you know I'm like well you know if like I'm just here to just to see what it's like so I beat them right after I beat the host right I get to the second round I see the pool drop from from from 2 million to 500,000 credits I'm like come on what the hell is that well it gets better right so I'm going through I get to the last round and I'm fighting the goddess play with a cooler the Big Bear and this is the the second highest ranked guy and I'm like oh [ __ ] you know that's you I'm saying you know if I win a win I lose I lose my first time in a second tournament online so I win it went down you know it was a pretty good fight went down I kind of dominate the last round but regardless I want and so when they started getting to the point where it started showing me getting my trophy and winning the currency they cut the game completely off so I don't know if I won the currency I don't know if it's registered I just know that I want to turn in me and I haven't seen anything that popped up as an achievement or nothing so can I Jania huh did they L make a you or what yeah they L mega me man they took him to the Hades they sent my way into Hades but you know what it's all good because I know I went in there and beat those guys or girls whoever I don't know who they were but I just went in there and I would and you know it was all good so now I know how it works and I'll be saying the tournament here pretty soon I'm going to stream tonight as well probably about probably about 10 o'clock central my time and and and we'll be having some tech and doing whatever but if you know I'm just like damn you know saying take you take you lost like a man look if it was me and I had a two million dollar pool if I lost then I lost I'm saying there's always going to be somebody better than you it's all about the competitive spirit so that's all I have to say about that yeah okay but the pool was two million see that's the [ __ ] part of it it was two million I'm like yes that's what I'm talking about so teaming is like I want my two dollars oh yeah I want my digital money I want my [ __ ] digital money but anyway right yeah one space box you mm-hmm Jerell y'all doing it big pony but anyway not playing uh that's cool [ __ ] dark we're just beep I ground the turkey right now it's all good man you mmm no I there's about maybe 15 games that I bought here recently and I haven't played any of them yet except for wipeout exhale I'm a huge fan of Wipeout exhale so if you it is fire it looks really good wipeout it's got three or four I can't remember how many it actually is but it's I think it's three of the old-school wipeout games that was on PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 and in its it looks really good and I had a lot of fun playing and I played it for like about three three and a half hours up in it on a first-party but other that I you know I got the order have it touched dad I got um I got Killzone have you touched that yet um death heart you hey X X

about it's complicated and yet Don knows how to make it happen the smoothness of the fur of the chauchilla yeah I'm saying into a silky form probably with the with the uh you know the buffalo titty milk that he was trying to give to developers I took two two people out there at e3 that didn't take it so he used it moist it damn moisturized it and then it turned silk so you know that's I don't know I don't know what he's talking about I got a chinchilla guy look don't you guys have a chinchilla guy like like for reals no no no I just got regular firm and I don't have uh okay there must be a

man thanks everybody for coming down here and hanging out with us it is really right now it was X by 4 for 8 this was the next podcast now we're doing alternative version of the game the dev and the gamer so done oh geez yeah got one of those in a while we need to do on doing we definitely need to do one yeah my hate is on an all-time high right now so like this this is the time right so yeah this is the man when your hate is at an all-time high you need to make more videos need to come out and be seen because that's what they want that's what the haters want they want al Mecca they want whatever name that you're going to be called Don I don't have no idea but that's what they want the Don diggity yo see guys that didn't take too long right by all time high on hates though is only three so whatever that was you're young youngin brought 201 try 201 really was it yeah so no video uh-huh was that your persona video no oh no that video had like over like I think maybe it was between thousands of 1500 views and it had it had a lot of a I think was maybe maybe over 100 but uh the save lakh video had over 200 so I was like huh yeah but but this was the thing like this is the thing that cracks me up with with a lot of these when I make videos right because I don't try to do fanboys [ __ ] I just say what I feel be opinionated and like let's talk about it right that I don't you know I want to hear everybody's opinion on this arm you know whatever I've made on my video and there'll be people in the chat or if like I'm on a podcast and I make I say what I say and then like you know maybe everybody in the podcast or on the chat will disagree with me but when I get off all through the week I I get people like K mega I agree with you I agree with you then man I was listening to it and I agree with so I'm like where were you at when I was getting blasted by so many people that the only way are they are they in the DM so you get the DM yeah I get the D I deal in public you set public saying right right right like so they had so many people he'll be up on xbox and then on the DM z-- telling me about how they agree with my stance on Locke and like I'm like where were your asses at when I needed you but hey let's love to the king yo I I do have to say um you know i'ma say it with you on the panel and everybody watchin huge shout-out to you for what you did on on multiplayer man because like I I went to check it out the whole D verse K mega thing which um if people don't know I actually kind of started that on V GST a few days earlier but uh oh yeah I instigated that [ __ ] oh but yo dude when I saw the panel like yo Z had just everybody in that place um I counted nine people and dude you you held your own man and and you said what you had to say and I give you props man you know well I appreciate it like I came in there to have fun because I knew the majority of everybody on the panel was going to disagree with what my stance was do I see now handle I knew that yeah and you know that's what I came with the with the with the organs in the back and it was about to have some church and they they complete it turned completely left like I'm kidding you get you got to keep your cool man when they people try to start getting personal oh don't eat into that but he say that was the thing to piss me off and I told Z about that today actually because when he was on whose plan second it was like D was coming out they're calling me names and [ __ ] right and so I tend not to call anybody any names right but he did infuriate me but when we went off air that's when I had my discussion with deke and I let him know what I felt about it and then Z came back and then turned it on while I while I was still saying what I was saying right and then I was just so triggered and I'm starting this I'm starting this [ __ ] and just go being all angry and mad but that wasn't what was I wanted to do it behind closed doors and and let him know what I felt about you you lower rate me because I'm a I got a stance on this whole 30 frames 60 frames per second we're talking about video games shouldn't be anything personal being said about either one of us or anybody on the panel and you know it just came out to be whatever it is and the haters they took it and they they ran with it too like ah he trying to act like he's hard or whatever at that but I'm too old I'm too invested into having fun with video games to be worrying about what el-amin thinks about me oh woman but mega check this out on us three that are on the panel right now me you and the done I think we've done something though because with the Dawn's video with what you said and what I've been saying about the whole frames per second and options scenario that's the thing that I don't I don't want the console space to turn into a watered-down PC space um I think we've we've gotten out there and we became a voice for for a group that wouldn't necessarily say too much otherwise so I think you know in terms of getting out there getting the word out there and getting people to think about these things I think this trio right here I think we did a damn good job man well I agree and then like I only not only talked to you know one other person but I talked to two other developers and you know it off the record of course and and the one thing that I was told that made perfect sense was like look you know it's like painting somebody it's like painting a 1:1 one group of people to the you know to whoever that's doing whatever a person doesn't like for instance like if you know you see a robber and the person is a person of color or what wipers whatever it doesn't matter and then you just go out and single-handedly just blame that whole group of people yeah a stereotype thing yeah you stereotype them that's not how it is every developer does something different than the other one and so if they you know and then of course the fact of these these xdx kits or whatever they're not you know uh Mike Ibarra was saying something on Twitter that like some of these things for like 75 80 percent done they're not all sent out to all these developers yet so if they're using the old what SDK you know kids or whatever then then that goes to you know maybe the third party doesn't have the advantages that people are thinking of and you know and they already get these games already made so they don't want to go as quick as this is the ex can do things in two or three hours if they already have a game already made from the ground up they don't want to do any extra changes they just you know so you know in the argument of was you know on it on multiplayer was that well you could just do it with a switch you could just do this and like you know I'm I'm not a damn developer and you know what's funny about that whole argument yeah so we're going to be talking about cliffy B today you know you show notes and stuff like that do I thought about that interview when he's yes so so cliffy B you know they have follow-ups and they have meetings and you know the our team meets together our team took them two weeks before they even had the official assets running on the piece of hardware like like it and he was talking about it late people said just hit a switch you know in you know and he facepalms every time people say that right so like people kind of don't get it like these PC guys are given controls but they don't understand what's really going on there in a certain degree that yes some of those controls are evolved in optimization like you know don't get me wrong but like a a game starts with a target framerate in mind they do play tests early on to figure out what their target frame rates of mine in the case of cliffy B he feels very positively that his game needs to be 60 frames per second that's his game I support him in that he even scrubbed away at first when it came to lawbreakers they had they had kind of like a blur going on around the edges of of the game and stuff like that he was like you know what [ __ ] that this is a straight competitive first-person shooter with these gravity aspects they they cut the blur out just to make make the overall appearance sharper looking and stuff like that because they weren't going for that cinematic feel it was a really good interview with him I actually uh I have more respect for cliffy now after after watching that that full interview dude yeah let's get into this so cuz we can talk more detail the cliffie thing and yeah no doubt oh for sure you guys ready to check out the intro let's do it oh when to foosh get in here like uh yeah all right guys let's go let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] no Skrill rattling horn what's going on people and welcome to another episode of the next podcast guys I am really excited to get in and talk these topics today are we got everything talking about call of duty talking about cliffy B and certain things that he said about the x1 we're going to get in on the OG xbox backwards compatibility and a bunch more but guys you know we cannot start off the show until we do the intros so I would love to introduce the first man comin live from the 405 and you know he's just trying to talk to the intelligent gamers out there my brother K mega what's happening everybody this is a K mega 405 but when we're doing it live what's happening everybody man as always a pleasure to be here and you know hopefully we'll fill the palette with information and have everybody be entertained let's go ahead and get this done man yeah no doubt no doubt man and I got to go straight into the the next guy on the list man a chinchilla wearing fool now with the gold-plated tires on his Dodge Omni it's time to stand up show that respect kiss that ring the dawn man you keep telling her when I got a Dodge Omni no I'm just looking for one so if anyone knows where one is I really do want one of those cuz those things can kill in a drag race believe it or not it really embarrasses people so yes my team I can find you it my godmother had a brown one yeah that's kind of the best color for that car no I'm not gonna lie to also that cane velour interior for sure or burgundy burgundy is pretty good too I don't get me wrong if you got burgundy that that seals the deal better color in in and of itself burgundy like it just speaks to you man absolutely I would have to grow moustache at that point Oh again dude I did the last time you had one that's all you talked about MIT I had a hard time doing the podcast under the influence of a moustache it's hard to do anything with under the influence of a moustache Ian if you're wondering what I'm talking about just take your pointer finger and hold it under your nose and see if you can make it through the podcast theism what's feel the power it's the most distracting thing on the planet Earth oh come on oh yeah not for anything you'll make oh when he when he talks about moustache you know III think a magnum p.i back in the day that dan you take that dick mustache driving the Ferrari I don't know man nothing is a cold air intake for your for your nose all right and uh guys I will let you know um as soon as he gets on he is on his way home right now our boy the golden voice you know that smooth talker uh our boy foo skis man he is on the way home to try to jump in as soon as possible and he's going to jump in on the show of course I like to give a huge shout out to oh snap it's Mel aka oh snap suckers the first lady of the next podcast out there peddling them cookies a secret ingredient is incredibly addicting but um yeah so you shout out she is in the chat I saw her as well and guys we got to get into these topics and I think to start it off let's let's talk about this Call of Duty news um for people don't know call a doof call a doofy call a duty modern warfare remastered is going to be sold by itself starting next week they are selling the remaster of modern warfare by itself and it is coming out on the ps4 and with this information there was a couple things that kind of stuck out to me first of all it was the price point uh $40 for this remastered as a standalone on which I can't wait to talk to Don and Megha about that to see if it's worth it and then it is coming out for PlayStation first like I said but they don't have a date yet for when it's going to come out on PC and of course Xbox one so let me hit let me hit K mega first when it comes to this now uh mega when it comes to this modern warfare remastered I think you weren't you one of the people I said eventually because it was bundled with infinite warfare didn't you think it was going to go solo at some point in time I was hoping that it would and you know and it is good to hear that they finally did it I mean look Activision is really smart because in gaming people gamers are really impatient and so you know you go a couple of months in you go two or three months and maybe even four maybe even five months if it was to here yeah it's close to a year and you still haven't seen it or heard anything from it and then you go ahead and you finally break but this is really good for people that held out that game is quality it's a true remake it looks fantastic it plays well of course with the power of the of the Xbox one and the pl and ps4 the game feels really good and fluent and I'm pretty sure that it plays fantastic on the PC as well so yeah for 40 bucks it is worth the buy now the only question that I have with that are they including the DLC because if they're not including the DLC then I have a problem with that because we're just only a couple of months away from having a new Cod come out and they're going to be asking for another $120 wait another hundred ten under $20 which you know kind of pricey you know I saw uh uh I was reading through the article they said something about the DLC but I can't remember y'all done do you know if if this uh the standalone for modern warfare remastered do you know if it's coming with the DLC as well I don't know I very rarely follow call duty even though it's something always constantly comes up on on the podcast because it's it is the the 800-pound gorilla in game you it is a force man no matter you no matter what it could be called duty uh each in addition and it's going to sell millions men well people either love it or hate it but it doesn't matter it numbers right and you know obviously there's a huge fan base in regards to that game so no I haven't been following what they've been doing it my interest level as I said like I pick up a Call of Duty once every two or three years you know it in regards to that I hope they would kind of follow that business model um in regards to that because I don't know I really feel like games you know are trying to keep their customers engaged in regards to that and there's probably better ways to make money off the customer that's I think that's mutually beneficial to both the gamer and the publisher as far as that's concerned but yeah I mean I don't know it says call duty man it's a rerun we've seen it before right you know it's it's the equivalent to you know a movie you watched and now it's on HBO and then now it's available on blu-ray right it's the same thing but you know dolled up I don't know you know this this kind of interests me because like I said it's almost a year you know since the last Call of Duty came out now this remaster came bundled with that and any time somebody was like well are you gonna sell sell it standalone uh you know Activision was really cool i that like god maybe and stuff you know they had plans to do this and um see it interests me because they've waited so long and I know a lot of people got tired and you know they're like you know what [ __ ] it I'm getting infinite warfare um do you guys think this is going to be a continuing practice with with Call of Duty and Activision and in like terms of remasters I don't know whoever wants to answer first good go hell I don't really think this is kind of a real problem I think it's a smart business move I don't I don't blame them for not saying anything because they made either a may not have a plan or have it locked down or they want to see where the sales of this goes before they do anything um it regards that and it compared to the movie industry right like movie just comes out just hits the you know the silver screen right and did you ask the actual people to publish that movie hey when is it going to come out on unmet flicks you don't ask that right all right but dude if you do they wouldn't tell you there's a natural progression see you're comparing something totally different right now though when it comes to movies there is a natural progression of being in the movies than going to DVD and then eventually going to these streaming services and stuff like that so that's all something completely different man but no because some of them hit streaming services at the same time they hit video right so this is on this is on this is a territory we haven't gone to before right in regards to this where you tag along a game that could be standalone but they don't they use it as a is a ploy to help sell their main the main game as far as that's concerned and you know they bundle it in right you know it's just it's a different practice it's it's newer in regards to that but I don't think it's a very fair question they asked the publisher right away it to be honest with you because they're not gonna tell you it's simple as that III got you man I don't know I thought it was a dirty move in the beginning when it when it came to infinite warfare is it a good business move yeah because people who D didn't even want infinite warfare definitely picked it up because you know they love the modern warfare and they definitely wanted to get a hold of a remaster and of course it was $20 more than your standard just one game titles though it was $80 to get the two games put together um man I don't know Yomega do you see this as like a practice that Activision is gonna kind of keep doing what Call of Duty like when the next one comes out do you think you're going to do another remaster try to do the same [ __ ] yeah yeah they could definitely try to do that but it hasn't been announced so I so maybe because this is a that's going back to the roots back to World War 2 I don't think it's going to happen so much for this one good plan yeah but but the next one I have no doubt in my mind that they'll definitely try to throw out a modern warfare 2 which is my favorite cod of all of them and so you'll be first in line then right and I would be first in line but the but the problem is with that is that you know it's good as it is a good business sense or you know it's it's it's good for business it still is foul to the consumer um you know I made a little like 30-second video or tell others about maybe 15 20 minute video when I first heard about them pairing them together and then you had to actually buy the other game in order to get that game I thought it was absolute [ __ ] because that that told you they didn't have any faith in oh they were fair and you don't hear too many people talking positive about infinite warfare so that just comes to show that the game was rushed or whatever but I did hear I heard a couple of things where people have said that the story was good but the actual online playability factor of it was just not that entertaining so um you know look it is what it is you know this it's a foul business practice out I mean we can look at Activision through the through you know just their history I mean look at like trance transformers I like those transform like I think transformers fight for Cybertron or something like that I've been winning that game but they will not drop it past $30 in that game has been out for a couple of years now you look at what they did with the old uh top-down a Super Heroes game I can't think of them off of my off the top of my head right now but those games are still 30 40 50 was like asking for 60 50 60 bucks for the UH for the flick combo for those get Alliance some Marvel Alliance yeah Ultimate Alliance are you kidding me that game was on the 360 and those those improvements work visually better so what are you doing so and always been really bad at it wanting to just gal G for money and not give you anything really in return so you're saying it's best to wait for the game that you want if you don't feel like it's a fair price right right yes that instead of just being impatient um instead of instead of being in pay wait if you if you got it well there's not going to be enough thinking like I said I don't think there's you can if you can handle the weight [ __ ] way yeah well I mean I think there's so many games that's going to be coming out within but when in front of the end of the summer which will in summer in August at the end of August until hell until III coming out this year well next year I'm sorry that there'll be plenty of games to where you will forget about Cod until you want whatever game that you that you're looking for because that's the one positive thing about it I still have a huge backlog and even though I broke down and I bought both games I had a cheaper price it was still what I think it was forty bucks I still haven't really got my feet wet with the game I still haven't even played it so if you really a cod fan go ahead and buy it but if not take your time wait till the price goes down and then do it that way because there's plenty other games out there available all right check this I this is this is what I think happened and um you guys are you're my brothers in crime right now you'll tell me if you think what I'm thinking is absolute [ __ ] if you think I'm on to something alright ah before infinite warfare I believe it was advanced warfare right and that's when people started kind of griping about where Call of Duty was going with the whole futuristic thing I feel that infinite warfare was still in development though I feel like they would have sold modern warfare remastered by itself but they were getting such a backlash yeah maybe not so much in sales even though sales were dropping but you know social media and you know sales weren't as good I mean they were so terrific that they were coming out with infinite warfare anyway and they just kind of slapped them together I feel like that's their their wild card now for them moving on because now with modern warfare to it I meet with world war two they're going more the way of what the fanbase wants right so they don't necessarily have to do that so I don't think you're going to see a remastered bundled with World War - but now they have that trump card up their sleeve that you know in case they they come out with something and they hear kind of like a backlash they can always throw a remaster on the oven and cook that [ __ ] up a little bit so just just so make sure I understand what you're saying you say that that remaster they held back for they were going to release it sooner but they must have hold that back just for the release of mate I'm not sure the title wasn't doing as well because that's what they would have to do to order to accomplish that you understand that right yeah yeah I see what you're saying so yeah I guess inevitably that's that's what I would be saying I was gonna say at first I try to try to cover my tracks a little bit so it's like well maybe not sooner or maybe like within a couple months time like after the release of the new one or something like that but I feel like they had a plan to to release the the remaster um by itself but just a huge huge kind of like backlash that they were getting from advanced warfare onward uh they knew they had to kind of pad their sales with infinite warfare now do you guys does that sound any bit plausible to you guys do you think I'm just like full of hot air right now on this I know I can see where you're coming from on that it's really hard to predict you know what Activision is really thinking or really doing it seemed to me it seems like too hard of the thing to coordinate to do do like you know that trump card sort of situation I really think they were kind of planning this as another option because a lot of a lot of studios are trying to kind of go after this kind of whole white whale thing where people are willing to spin the extra cash for more if that makes any sense either be from DLC or you know a special edition that has another Call of Duty attached to it I really feel like it was more of kind of that move and more than mourning more than anything else but you know I could be wrong I don't know I mean it's just guesswork right in regards that but I just feel like maybe the conspiracy theory was little bit too difficult to pull off with time frame and stuff like that because not for anything it is it's a remaster alright it's not gonna bust all that hold on you let me finish [ __ ] oh it's it's a remaster right it's not going to take as long in development as a new IP if infinite warfare was already in the process of being developed and then they realized what was going on I think they could have I think it'll do your job than what I had to do because here's the thing is like Call of Duty's play mechanics don't change a whole lot right we can all agree on that right right um it's like oh don't get K mega started oh come on don't get him started but no no but they're play mechanics don't change a whole lot right so a lot of times it's you know put any me this oversimplifying like it's another studio look bad or anything like that but you know it's placed at character you're just this character here you know modify this AI routine you know at ad this model or texture in there and i'm a guy i guys say yo my bad guys say this you know sobs he is going off into chat you he told Newfie oh they could sell Call of Duty DLC to a dung beetle like yeah that is the true that they could but when I'm but what I'm saying is that I think the same amount of work that went into a remaster because have you seen it actually looks really really well it looks was a really really good um you know and that being said they put the same amount of love and care as they do in every Call of Duty releases they did in that one so I don't think that was a one and done rush job at all the mount of worth they put in there was quite a bit I average Call of Duty development is three years I would knock a year off since it's a remaster it still takes a lot of coordination they hit those marks at the same time alright well I think I think when it comes to me and Don I am I'm going to agree to disagree I see your point you make valid points but I am a stubborn ass Italian as well and I think there might have been a little bit more behind the scenes when it comes to Activision you know anybody that follows me you know you guys know how I feel about Activision as a publisher they are straight money-hungry um I don't know mega do you think there's any kind of like validity to to what I'm saying here do you think there's a chance that you know remaster the my warfare remaster was gonna release at some point in time by itself but then when they saw what was going on with the call of duty community in terms of like the futuristic aspect they already had infinite warfare in development they had to roll with it uh so they just slapped this one together oh come on man well okay I'm a-comin agreeance with both of you guys but I do uh I am I am but this is the thing they overall they were confident in infinite warfare so they had to do something to uh meet demand for their publishers or whoever that's you know for the stocks and all that because they have been on the decline for for a little bit and even though the game looks really really well it was kind of odd that you would bring out an older game out of the blue out of the blue you're saying and try to and solicit like that so you know I but I will not say that they put it together because they did put some some TLC into that into modern warfare that game looks amazing are you who's thinking that if they did apply the trump card that they they were not they were using the previous title as judgment but where there were the kind of where they were at far as like the community was concerned um and and they pushed a button sooner than than later is what you're right yes pretty much yeah pretty much because they were they like I said they just didn't have any confidence in it is.if and like I said for all I have not played the story yet of infinite warfare but from everybody that I've talked to they have said that there was a good story it was just really short so that you know this people were tired of the other futuristic stuff I think you know I got tired of it after advanced warfare advanced warfare story was absolutely epic I lied ori the story for advanced warfare I'm not a big Call of Duty guy but that story had me man I I beat that story because that would come go ahead I'm sorry no no it's just saying because that was fun I got I'll give that to you as well man like the advanced warfare I don't think enough people actually talked about the story aspect to that right know the story of advanced warfare was awesome I enjoyed advanced warfare you know because I played a lot of it with a lot of friends it's just that when it came to black ops 3 where it fell off for me was that the demo was so much better than the actual Xbox version of the game you could actually tell the difference between the PlayStation 4 version and the Xbox version and so I bought it on the PC and at that time I was just really a waste of money because I haven't even played it on I haven't even booted it up on my PC so it's just because because because I was just so disgusted of how they played on the X like excellent so I was just like ah you know [ __ ] it so but they still got my money the money out of me okay look this world war 2 thing looks promising but again it's Cod it's mindless fun it's going to sell because it's going back to the roots it's just that I don't think any you know we don't have to worry about any added in any added old-school games yeah yeah that stuff this version maybe next year yeah but at least Activision has definitely taken notice on the fact that you know with infinite warfare it sold more because it was bundled with a remaster of a game that the community absolutely loves right so if they're going to take a risk in the future right and you know they plan these titles out I mean you have what was it three different development teams working on a different Call of Duty as they got your number teams three years of development perks per title now so if they're going to take a chance and try to go back to the future per se at some point in time don't think that they won't think about having aa like maybe a smaller dev team or something like that working on a remaster for another older Call of Duty title that Pete loved I feel like Activision has taken notice as seen the sales and they will do what they can to make the most profit even if they feel like that even if they don't have that trust in that title like they did for infinite warfare like a mega set and that's pretty much what I was trying to say um but guys let's move on because I want to talk backwards compatibility um I want to talk about it because I feel that not a lot of people have for some reason uh with this pass III Microsoft's conference um you know Phil Spencer came out you know the Xbox guys came out and they they announced that oh gee Xbox backwards-compatibility to the Xbox one and I know this is something that quite a few people on social media have asked for uh so I want to get you guys general thoughts on this and then I want to dive in a little deeper with you guys so um yo mega what do you think about the og back compat do you think this is time well spent for for Xbox one moving into the future man oh hell yeah yeah I mean you also got to remember that there's so many people that that so many people that are younger in gaming and they the only thing they know is the PlayStation 3 and the P in the end of 360 that's all they know and there's a lot of people that the PlayStation 4 is all they know and there there are people out there that actually don't understand why you should why anybody even gives a damn about the Xbox brand and so if you bring back those old games because the old the OG xbox did not sell very well you bring that back and you bring back some of those those great titles that the OG xbox had and showed that diverse the diversity that death system had and polished the graphics up and have it run really well man you got a gym on your I don't I don't expect them to well yeah and also it brings up up it brings one of those things like just for like phantom does we don't know how it saw how its selling how it is and all that [ __ ] but we do know it's out there in the wild and if it's selling well and if people are actually gravitating to and people like it then it gives Xbox indicator that hey we can go forward and proceed on making this an actual next-gen title so yes bring it bring those OG xbox Tigers hmm see I I hear what you're saying and young mega you know I I had the the OG xbox absolutely loved a me and you go back and forth like when it comes to the OG titles uh I know one of them Tao Fang is a game we definitely both agree on yeah um my whole thing is all right now for people who want options and are willing to go back that far I don't have a problem with that I just don't see it registering with kind of like the newer gamer now just because of how dated these games are all right now you're talking about polish up graphics and stuff like that I don't think it's it's going to be like that they might run better they might look up you know possibly a little bit better due to resolution or whatnot but in the end you're getting your original og Xbox game and you know even with me being a huge fan of Xbox even back then there's only a handful of titles that I would actually be interested in revisiting I would rather see them move forward and and make sequels um I don't know yo Don what do you think about this man with the OG xbox back compat um I think it is really in the spirit of what Microsoft's really trying to do of everything right they're trying to give value to their consumers and to me it doesn't add any additional value I have that I think the and this is not just on Xbox one but I think the Xbox one plea a PlayStation 2 ps1 era in 64 that's probably the ugliest era of game that I can think of because like they tried going 3d a lot yeah yeah the early versions of 3d stuff was just just it's an eyesore man like for me to look back it's really really hard yeah I'm glad that you know things are running cleaner and how they're supposed to through that and you would expect that with how they're emulating it and you know all that sort of thing but I actually have to get up to noon if probably the only one that announced any game that I really wanna play on the original Xbox which was Conker's Bad Fur Day they did a remake of the n64 version on that and actually that version of conker looks really good um the the first shader they use on that actually looks very phenomenal for that early generation of 3d stuff well yeah not with with you saying that I mean um at that point in time the OG xbox was the most powerful console out uh and you know I know I say you know the games will look dated and stuff like that if it was like a maybe two years back I wouldn't have said so so much just because I feel like uh out of all those consoles from that era the original Xbox the games would mature or come to fruition today a lot better than the other ones you know from the other platforms but still I gotta say except for like the true Xbox fans who have been there for like so long I'm not sure if I see this as a good move for like the newer gamers to catch on to the old old games and possibly sequels it's not a bad move that's that's what I'm trying to say like you know it doesn't have a huge appeal to me personally don't don't care uh you know at the end of the day but I don't represent every gamer right when it comes to my personal interest and those sort of things are right so I always have to look at it from from a grander scale I have to look at it for other people um it's a good thing it you know it is kind of part of that PC mentality spilling over to the console market it is one of the pros to PC right uh in regards that you know I don't play those sort of you know in the case of when I play my PC I don't play games from that generation on my PC I just don't do it that that is the generation and kind of skip over um in regards it because you know that stuff is kind of an eyesore regardless of how much power you pump into it and you know brute force you use to do certain things it's just not not my cup of tea uh in regards that's fine like but if people want it and people want to play it that's great it's not that shouldn't that shouldn't be looked at as a bad thing you know really ever uh in regards and I don't think it really it's about creating an emulator right and at that point it's just about getting permission right so realistically it's not taken away from for me thing if anything is generating it's going to generate more revenue for Microsoft uh that they'll be able to put in other things and they'll be able to as caming us a judge these some of these older titles and see if there's anything worth revisiting nice no I would have to disagree with a few things that Don say it though um with the mic games almost mostly I mean although almost games where I source ninja gaiden still holds up even today you're right there I would agree with you on that one um that you know and then didn't they have ninja got a black on on the original Xbox ah versions right yeah they got like three versions out yeah I think it was black one black was the best one right like when I was like ready to pick that one yeah and then you also had um you had a do a sake oh it's all you looked good um do a three come on say it well yeah all the dinner dinner lodge holds up dude they were generations ahead there are generations ahead anyway you know like but like you say like games like brute force yeah then they're not going to look then they won't look as well but that's one thing that that I think that you've missed because I do have emulators and when I go onto my PC and I go and I played when I play you know older games and see them how they look yo you know saying like okay like a game like Soul Calibur on the even from the PlayStation one with the power of what my PC can push it still looks like a like a strong indie it looks it looks good and then looks dated but it still looks good um you know it's just a court like okay now if you say [ __ ] like let's see I'm so calm so calm looks like it looks horrible doesn't matter what a emulator can do to it it looks horrible but it's then it comes to the point of how that game performs in how it feels and because of the power of the PC that I have it runs fluid so now I understand yeah on higher strain rate state scene is better texture filtering you know could be better but at the end of the day the textures are still Melky the polygon counts are still low like in like those things stand out to me all that part you know maybe maybe you look at me in my position my one of the things I do is trying to make games look the best they possibly can right you like that's that's that's what I do throughout the day right so so when I want to see things like going back like I appreciated for what they were at the time right but I mean I can't I can't appreciate you I'm going for it you're a little bit different gaming and that's it that's the thing I'm fighting for you it's not a me feature right I I think it's a good feature for people like yourself they really love playing that and as I said there are going to run better they aren't going to talk about it more between now and when it rolls out so you know it's a good thing for the platform it's just not my thing are you check this out so there's a lot of people say like mooch mooch don't want to go backwards just please yeah they don't want to go backwards but as a person that that is into nostalgia and like like okay like last night on grg we were talking amia fobs really and then we were bringing up about the new Atari that's going to be coming out and and they never really showed what if it's gonna be a newer console my predictions were that it was going to be like a like a like a atari mini like that's gonna fail it was to it it's gonna fail but not not necessarily not necessarily its gonna fail man no no hold on wait when I started bringing that stuff up and start bringing those older games up like pitfall it dodgem and you know not ET but other there was other Roger pac-man Frogger I mean look yes you would think that it would just fall flat on his face it would just show out there I don't think you will I think it's a nostalgia piece that there's older gamers especially people that are way older than me that will say you know what I remember what I used to gain back there and they'll buy it all right there's nothing I can't make it oh yes the most is the most attached to the worst-looking like that is the worst generation a pixel art is the original Atari and the worst generation of polygons are it's the PS 9 what you know but but not but with the one thing about that era that the one thing about their era with the ps1 and even going back to the Atari that was the most complete time of gaming in the history of gaming in my opinion you know say this just people that's a lot younger than me right but when I put in you know saying people love the ps2 uh the ps2 was great the Dreamcast was my is my second favorite console of all time my stellar spirit and my first my first one is the ps1 because there were games that I'd never seen before and at that time those graphics look absolutely amazing even though now they may look like [ __ ] but because of how those games look like Street Fighter II X em you know Final Fantasy 7 you just keep going up tous shinden a [ __ ] wild on there's so many goddamn games with the place that you put out at that time even even the Saturn itself a Virtua Fighter and all in Panzer Dragoon all those type of games they still felt good with my item and I still in among last those two games last forever check this out III knew you're trying to hit that last forever thing at the end but here's the deal it's been nice like hearing you talk man talking about memories alright but that's just what they are dude you you had said in your previous statement you said that like a lot of these games will look like strong Indies now and and just with me you got to think about I'm thinking about my personal opinion here right Oh a strong indie is going to take away from my past memories with these titles alright if like I have fond memories of a lot of games and I'm not saying that I wouldn't pick up a few a G Xbox games but do you really want like the newer generation of gamers to think of those as like at the highest point strong Indies you know what I'm saying yes let me call that hold on hold on okay I'm going with with that being said I I would rather them take the chance on these titles and either do reboots that take advantage of this generations graphic engines and stuff take a chance on them either on reboots or sequels and stuff like that that's what I want to see I'm not saying that it's necessarily a bad move to have that emulator on the x1 I'm just saying it's not gonna it's not gonna mean anything to a lot of people you're right are you under the impression though that it takes away from that cuz it doesn't like it doesn't take away from them making new titles or new IP is like well if it's a totally separate budget it's it's like no no not in terms of money-wise I'm not saying that at all right but if they are going to use if they are going to use this backwards compatibility to gauge interest I have a feeling that that is a bad move in my opinion all right uh not for any your so you're saying that you just rather have them just take the chance regardless take the chance like you you got you um you have a lot of quality titles that came out on the OG xbox a lot of them with uh with things that could be kind of like brought to today and and really sold to the gamers of today and and can still like will be hugely popular like I'm thinking Tao Fang right back then it was it was basically the first game that really showed that destruction on a character now if they can go ahead and make the sequel on this generations kind of like graphics engine and stuff like that and really go nuts on that kind of like a fight destruction when came to your bones and all that goes up I know Mortal Kombat does that to a certain extent but I'm talking about making it part of the focal point of the game and really going in on that and showing something that yo is really in-depth when it comes to the damage and stuff like that I I think they would do good doing that and lo the others like it so say say they released well they are going to release it they're releasing backwards-compatible regardless of it or not it's happening guys right are you are you afraid if they are purely using that as a barometer that you may not get some of these newer versions of exactly exactly because I don't thoughts going to register unfortunately now the console was for its time the most powerful console and out of all the consoles that were out in that generation that those games would kind of um what would survive longer right but I still feel like they would be dated to the point that the the newer generation of gamers and stuff like that won't necessarily adhere to it so that's why I'm saying it might not be the greatest idea if you're going to use that to gauge that specific audience guys let me know let me tell you how it's really going to play out those sort of titles are not on the radar period the only chance for any of those titles really getting a radar for any company to take a chance on them in place those big bets is things like backwards-compatible well that's [ __ ] to me then well that's how the industry works no regardless of you agree or I agree with it I'm just trying to tell you how like how that plan does work does work out you may not like it I don't like it as well because there are certain things I would like to like to see as well as a gamer right not just as a developer but as a gamer but at the end of the day the industry is trying to find ways to minimize risk and this is the way to do it the problem is they won't go on radar otherwise it just won't happen so it is so essential that we do get services like this it is essential so it preserves these games too you know so they don't just disappear in some land field somewhere right you can buy them digitally or something like that classics it's important for classics to be you know played so people can see where certain game mechanics came from and where it all started and on sir said I think that's a seriously important I'm just not interesting to go back there I've been there done that right but if you if you're talking about the risk you're talking about but like it I don't see you know as a publisher just taking the risk just not gonna happen it's fairly it just doesn't happen I mean it happens in the blue moon but it's it happens less than than the other way around and that was the thing that I wanted to 22 to address was that look there just look at games just look okay like a game like Shenmue that game is very popular but why in popular though like what were my self the same question expired it was a cool ass game I liked it I loved I loved Sherman welcome a lot I am yeah it's great it's a classic crowd it's a it's a crowd cult fail but the only problem that the the reason why shimu didn't sell as much is because it was on two pieces of hardware that didn't then cross over like the Dreamcast as much as everybody that bought a Dreamcast they know how high how dope that system was and even anybody playing Yoji Xbox they know how great that system was but the fact of it was the PlayStation 2 dominated the era then it was what the n64 then the Gamecube there were so many other consoles at that time that had everybody else's it's in shame it was high to say okay see that's think they had the attention of gamers that nobody wasn't caring because if you remember there was an ad that had a crash bandicoot and Mario looking over a Bill Gates with a with his xbox and he was like a little dude yeah there is how I didn't like yeah and you know so that already gave the negative impression that this Xbox was not going to be validated in the gaming space because you know Microsoft is the enemy and is bad and they don't want if they don't and nobody that's a true gamer shouldn't want this system to be it'd be there the Gamecube I mean I'm sorry not the Dreamcast it was it was it was going in the right direction but Sega made a lot of mistakes and they didn't advertise that damn system enough they had plenty of games to compete they just didn't they just didn't do what they was supposed to do Yomega so that's a similar game selling when it comes to OG xbox here's what what I feel happen like they Microsoft had to pay its dues alright it's never it wasn't in the console space of course you had other Nintendo juggernaut you had Sony which came up on the with the ps1 it paid its dues with the ps1 became credible within the console community I feel that by the end of that generation Xbox was credible in the console community I feel like they did what they had to do they came out with the more powerful system they came out with features they you know with the Xbox Live and all that good stuff I feel like they did what they had to do they brought out halo which kind of changed the the future of gaming um and and that will always be tied to that OG xbox they became credible with that like I said I just don't feel that like these titles will respond well to to the gamers that haven't experienced I box I totally disagree with both of you on this aspect just because of this reason because if anybody can play games like broforce or shovel knights going back to the 8-bit good [ __ ] point if they can fight those games then they can play OG xbox games that's rendered a little bit higher don't listen to the fringe that's the problem with so many Xbox fans out there they listen to the fringe element out there that says everything that Xbox does is absolute [ __ ] and that's not the case if you know I'm looking I got a play section for right in front of me and then I look it I bought I was so excited to see twisted metal black and then like a marketer Creed I love mark of the tree I wish PlayStation would bring that that game bad but you put those games in they look like hot-ass garbage they they I see them look better on emulators and look better on on the only original systems than what they do on the play section for their but they still charge you 15 [ __ ] bucks for that if you're given oh gee Xbox games and you give them out for like ten bucks and and give the experience of somebody playing crimson skies or a ninja game blackhat oggi you know the list goes [ __ ] on right yeah that gives dead goose gamers you know the idea of like whoa now I see why these games while these games were so popular that's a shot yes it was okay Freeman listen to the friend know you got but I said I agree with you I am Pro for this move I'm Pro for preserving games so you can play games there I'm just not excited about the side I've lived on like for yet but I'm saying though I'm right there with you I'm I think it's a good move I'm not on the same campus bot like being bot are on different page okay no matter on on this one right come to the dark side done hotspots caught up to his opinions like I respect his opinions but you know like at the end of the day this is a good thing for gamers I absolutely believe is a good thing for gamers desert me cuz there's there's games like you're your father right there's games that like that you played now that people are having children now will never see never seen your lifetime they'll have no one you pass though the times pad even if I brought it up and and had them play it now they wouldn't [ __ ] get it we'll see you know okay let's use movies Godfather it doesn't really look that great to me now but it's a classic it's a classic and and you can look at that from a film standpoint in see where things have come from you can learn from that so it is important for these things okay so around cuz you know hold on done because The Godfather is a classic right what year did that come out by the way I don't care do you remember I play like in the late seventies on looks like 700 look like 79 I'm not good with dates on movies so yo go ahead chat [ __ ] hang me all right I'm not good with dates with movies but say let's say 79 so basically because the Godfather was a great movie in 79 uh TV should start a streaming service and include absolutely every single movie from 1979 just 1979 no but a but look some of the best classic movies though came from that era look okay and then people gravitate to them they then that's when you see that you got a hit on your hands let me look at star wars star if you go back and look at the old Star Wars people like what what the hell are we talking about but now look at the Star Wars now okay look at this game right now this being played right now bye bye bye ux5 yeah you mean to tell me that game is a pretty game right is a [ __ ] beautiful game yeah it's a beautiful game but you mean to tell me that Rayman Origins is not [ __ ] beautiful even being or old hardware are you mean to telling me that that that everybody was gravitating to Crash Bandicoot and that game looked ugly as [ __ ] I mean yeah you get some your brother they gave they gave enhancements to it and it is still ain't even 4k or anything like that but people are gonna buy that game and that wasn't by any cutting cuz it's that mean and there's more to Crash Bandicoot than say um Cornell bars in frenzy or or even a game I'm looking forward to that I hope they do but it was developed by ninja theory is kung fu chaos I feel like um the because of the art style to that game I feel like it'll hold up even to today uh I thought that game looked absolutely incredible on the OG xbox and I didn't see another game to do kind of like that that style of character in such a detailed way and I I would I would pick that up if it went oh gee you know back compare ok alright I'm gonna bring a couple ring up another game for you in it to shut down this argument right here okay you've said that a lot but you've never shut down an argument okay well okay I mean I agree with you I want to shut it down because this game is giving them enhancement and bringing back the old graphics mega [ __ ] man mega man those old 8-bit graphics and they're bringing a show that they show the new version of Megaman that they're bringing back that they're bringing back those old classics because remember they did one through six I believe they're bringing the rest of them and they was when I was watching III and exception Dell Casey there you go [ __ ] exception backwards compatibility is a good thing and I'm not saying is it people know look all I'm saying if true gamers don't listen to the [ __ ] Fringe and listen to these [ __ ] that shits on everything that's act that's that's positive for Xbox and get their head out there and to say will because they should bad I think it's bad to get your goddamn hand out chance and you'll play enjoy not supposed to do well every years here's the thing of like if you look at the 360 back Pat you look at the original Xbox back back it's very fair to say that the original sorry the 360 back Pat has more impact a lot more impact the game so look is dated they you know the you know 3d wasn't at the very beginning where a lot of it was crap in that you know as far as all that stuff is concerned but you know then again it's important to preserve the things the market dictates it with digital and all that sort of stuff you know the market will dictate it you know it's not like it's talking up shell sort of shell song at Walmart or anything like that it's just available to the consumer and if they want to buy it or not it to get burn on original Xbox one too and it's not gonna be that mini - because it's not like they're going to be able to get the rights for a lot of these it's just gonna be whatever ones they can kind of get through the red tape yeah yeah I don't I don't I I definitely agree with that done I don't think there's going to be a lot of titles that people would be like oh man yeah I want that or whatever and it's on an individual basis right and they're not going to get it because for some reason other look I'm still I said it's red there's retro podcast there's retro game of forms this retro game this retro game all retrograding fans everywhere for for just coming out to say well because it doesn't look as good as what these games look like now I'm telling you it had if the fanbase would just understand that these are these are these are just games just like any other game you can learn your history and say well damn I hated xbox this whole time and this game was great look there's what okay creepy bunny right creepy bunny I think I just finished Orion apply flourish yeah right right he posted the he finished he said that's one of his favorite games of all time hell yeah always [ __ ] on xbox you always come in to us about something and now he realized a great game look that's what I'm talking about because the reason why creepy bunny and so many other people that has not jumped out and bought an Xbox or played Xbox games are played OG xbox games with Dreamcast or whatever beforehand it's because they listen to the French element that dog those games out just if that game looks interesting to you just buy it play it you might like it that's all I'm saying oh my god yeah yeah I definitely agree with that it is a great it's a great thing kudos to you Microsoft if you ever enter if you have an interest in a game yeah definitely but um guys we have to move on we're going to move on to the the main event of tonight and that that is our buddy cliffy B and um it seems like the Xbox community on social media got rather pissed off at him uh for an interview he had and it basically it was about uh I forgot oh it done who was the interview with man I forgot like they're all the same they think it was GameSpot I'm not really sure don't [ __ ] don't call me on it like but I do man it's one of the interviews I ran through during e3 week um actually I was listen I was listening to an interview when the Nintendo Direct was called on instead uh so it's a good interview for sure yeah definitely I I do have to say when it comes to cliffy um like I've pictured him as an [ __ ] for a long time rightfully so I mean even in this in you like their there were some things that he said I knew where he was going with it and stuff but I have actually um I'm ready to give him more respect now I I was uh I thoroughly enjoyed the interview I liked what he had to say on a lot of things um for people who were going uh going about what he said about the x1 and he was like basically we're talking about you know the Xbox platform he was like the the X o x oo or whatever they're calling it right now uh it was kind of taken out of context in my opinion because even when he was talking about just like games at e3 um he brought up spider-man but he was saying you know how his game was a newer title it was a new title brand new brand new IP or whatnot and even games like spider-man I mean it looks great but let's just be real it's spider-man is what it would basically what he said and stuff like that I don't know yo mega did you have a chance to see Kate ah cliffy b's interview and uh kind of like the backlash on Twitter and such no I when I seen it when I when I when I seen the post it was it was already late and we were about to start to show so no I did not get to get to listen to it but look could Phoebe's got to make his money on all platforms he can't just be selective on you know because he's got his game coming to the ps4 first or into PC you know can't hate on that is eventually going to come to the x1 I don't know what he actually said so I'm not gonna you know give a thorough opinion but I will just say this these guys got to make money they got a living and he's got a kiss-ass in order to get to where he wants to be with his with with uh with his work so I just needed that I got you and see the thing is when it when it comes to um lawbreakers and how it was PC and now its ps4 as well but cliffy B actually he addressed that and he said you know not for anything he has 65 people working under him that have families as well that needs to pay the bills that need put food on the table so when you're working through um you know where you're going to go next or whatnot like you have to make a judgment call and I actually I respect him for that he didn't try to sugarcoat it or anything like that he was like the ps4 right now has a bigger install base which means there is a you know there is a better chance to make the most that they can right now and I you know when he when he said you know not Frank there's sixty five people underneath me that all have families and stuff like that that want their checks you know what I'm saying I'm like walked him to to think about like being the head of the development team and having to think about that because I know a lot of people on social media went kind of like ham on him is like you know Xbox made you what you are today and all that good stuff which you know it's it's true gears made him what he is really and but to see it from that other standpoint it had me step back and be like you know what damn I might have made that same decision myself right I'm totally ready so yeah so God what did what did you think about the interview what do you think about kind of like that backlash um from from social media where's there's people saying that they're not going to pick up the game now strictly because he was like the Xbox you know the o X o X whatever they're calling it right now here's the thing it's like um if you read the articles are made about this interview and then you actually go watch the interview you get two completely different impressions yeah right he did say everything that they said in the the written stuff right but they take out of context they like set it up do little quotes one little phrase from him and then they go from the to the next thing right and I kind of you know I don't think cliffy B really gives a [ __ ] but I like it but like I feel kind of bad for for people like that they're just trying to do their damn job and then somebody in the media wants to take it out of context and blow it completely out of proportion he you know in he's so many cool things for people to look people are starving for game information how games are made what's going on behind the scenes they want to know all this stuff right he lays it out there right cuz he's in the pity he can do all that sir stuff right and everyone only thing that people get from the interview is a couple lines that are talking about context and then they twist into kind of hate like that that irritates me like you can look at the the media outlets to actually did the written interview and you can look at the you know versus what it was actually done in person and you can't does not look at that media outlet and say hmm I wonder what their attentions are like it's not a mystery right like you can you have to connect the dots and it's pretty simple that they have attention to cause drama that's what they're trying to create there look drama gets clicks man you know baby yeah we all know that right but but that's what they're doing right and you know you just kind of have to look at it for what it is I think it's a great interview did it matter if it too even said even compliments turn things on Xbox and none of that stuff was in the written article he believes Xbox will catch up to PlayStation you said that it he said that in the interview you talked to Phil this is before the leak numbers we know about what was in homes which is close to you think 40 million um yeah hi they know yeah yeah it's like 38 million or whatever right um and then Sony's claiming 60 million chips so you know who knows where that because you're comparing two different things right yeah where things are actually at but they're close enough there that they have definitely our dog in the fight it's not a 2 to 1 sales ratio like people originally were pitching it as right in before all that information became public right he talked to Phil Phil trust them he understands him in the industry and vice versa where he's coming from and you know in that interview he was saying like everyone distinct sigh hate Xbox I don't hate Xbox right you know he did talk negatively about like some of like the hardcore fans that are salty or people that are coming at him in you know that shame on you know I'm a next box guy like I'm not proud when Xbox people go after developers like it's not cool it's not cool at all and to do that sort of stuff now I really encourage everybody community to have a better understanding see where things are coming from and then when you do comes understanding you kind of call call things out then that has a lot more impact right that's where I encourage people to do you know alright it's part of how you act not how you react dunh dunh hold on hold on just one second man hold that thought so I really want you to finish but yo shout-out to Genesis fan out there he's like they do the same thing to phil spencer and you know what genesis here's the deal I am NOT a believer of well since they do it on one side we can do it on the other all right we have shown ourselves time and time again to be an awesome gaming community we do not want to go down that road where it's like well since everybody is saying all this [ __ ] to phil spencer yo come over here yoshida or come over here cliffy and and start doing that I've made multiple videos about certain PlayStation fans are extremists who have threatened us threatened rape have threatened death to actresses are like a Tomb Raider and stuff like that I don't see that in this community and I don't want this community to go down that road well I know what I don't want the place at your community to go down that road either they already going down there room yeah well but not all of them though that like the other one the other ones stay quiet they just don't say anything right but that's that's that's the biggest problem though I mean when I listen to other Pro Playstation channels like okay like for instance there was there was a podcast last night and they were basically trying to downplay what Jim Ryan's were saying like they instead of just coming out of like let's just say that was Mike Ibarra Aaron Greenberg Susan I forget her last name anybody from the Xbox staff that said what would Jim Ryan said we that has common sense would be bunk that and say that that was that was trashed that is absolutely out of bounds I mean absolutely you know you have the head of your company telling you that telling all of us gamers that the console war is stupid and other people thinking that they stay away from other youtubers because of the so called console war that that like some of us interject to the but you know the friends that think that we're doing console war [ __ ] you know saying but and to and to not say nothing or to downplay it that is fraudulent that that that's like that's just kissing too much ass that's not doing the right thing and and you know saying and just like for just the customer service aspect a lot of things they don't come out with their pitchforks and torches until there's something positive going on with the Xbox or if somebody goes after PlayStation then they come after whoever that they come after they date they're a weird cult acting community that doesn't want to hear anything negative and that's that's deplorable but I mean back to cliffy B right like they took them out of context they they pin the the the most a gross you know fan base of the Xbox community against cliffy right like that's what they did they just you know try to get bunch of people riled up but if you look at and then really encourage everyone look at the actual video look it up if you want all tweet it out shakedown why don't why don't you when you when you do get a chance tweet out the interview you can tag like meek a mega you know the panel and stuff like that absolutely and so you can see guys can see in the in the context that what it really really is um in regards that and the only thing he really expressed was is more of the people that are just overboard that's that's who he was talking about when someone says says fanboy and you instantly get triggered by that or you know woo me you know maybe you should look at where you're at right because it because you know the whole term and I don't like the word fanboy I don't like to use it you know you notice I don't use it here on the podcast or anything like that um because it is a derogatory turn towards gamers I don't think it's it's healthy but it's it's one of those things like it really means that you're not rational right that's that's you're talking about your fan that's completely irrational about what's going on in and I don't think the Xbox most of the Xbox community is not like that right because they call out things like you make us a yeah you know in regards there are some I'm sure there are I don't I try not to associate in it and when my have friends that are kind of going a little bit more towards that route I just kind of kind of just sit back and let him work through their stuff right because like you know no one's perfect we're humans and things like that but cliffy B had a place a bet for his staff right and he had to make a judgment call yes I was that's what I was talking about man the other side it's not just cliffy I bet you even though it's his teammate I'm willing to bed I don't know cliffy personally or anything like that but I'm willing to bet maybe he talked to his staff as well right you know he just seems like he would have done that or the staff would have had some sort of impact on that yeah and people also don't realize law breakers was me by people the bolts work directly under Microsoft and Sony in regards to that so there are people on that staff that also worked on the Killzone series yeah it is as well so and he's not you know he's but going after him Scott and all its gonna do it should be like ooh that's kind of tossing I want to build a good community around a community based game right like all that's going to do is delay the game coming to the platform that's that's all you're going to do is cuz because he wants to build a good community around that a core fanbase you know find that niche that that really loves his games and if it blows bigger than itch you know you I'm sure he'll be a static and his team will be a static but it's a living breathing thing and so was those sort of titles he you know he just doesn't want to be associated the talks kitty I think he could have used a little bit more tact but he's in dependencies not he's not a very tactful person like no you calm down he's definitely calmed down he used to be more tactful but I think once he became more independent he just kind of just got tired of a the tactful side of things and just kind of tells it how how he is but you know he looks at his live people really know me they'll understand where I'm coming from uh you know Garza he's just not a guy that translates well over tax like even in his tweets not really good to be honest with you but but in person when he actually kind of get to see in full and Terry you know entirety what he's talking about it's a good interview I recommend people to go watch it I will tweet it out all I'll basically tag everybody here in the podcast it regards though yeah definitely definitely like I said when it when it's all said and done you could read the articles and everything like that but when they when they're based off an interview go and check out the interview because like I say I was really kind of like entertained by what he had to say oh it was cool to see him I mean he was talking about overwatch and he was taught of course he was there to promote his game and and that's what he does and that's what he does well right but with talking about overwatch he's like well you know with overwatch overwatch is a bunch of characters with special abilities and some guns he's like but law breakers is guns with some characters that have abilities like he in other words the focus is around the gunplay and stuff like that guys don't don't don't read into a lot of these clickbait articles um this game does look very interesting it's it's it's one of those games that since it's an online game uh cliffy B and his team realized that they shouldn't charge $60 for this this service game or whatnot and it is a $30 at its core $40 with a couple extra skins I believe it's a kill zone set of skins or whatnot so it's not even be a full $60 title and like I said look three DLC yeah and then free DLC after the fact so like I said when it comes to these projects Friday the 13th it was one of the one of the big reasons why I was looking at Friday the 13th um like when they when they do this when they when they feel that you know a digital game needs to be cheaper for the gamer for the consumer and stuff like that those are those are projects that I like to really look into and possibly endorse if I like the game so don't don't let this like turn like a sour taste in your mouth or whatnot because if you if you go and check out the whole interview I think you will actually be pleasantly surprised with a lot of stuff he has said but uh guys on that note uh it is about time for me to pick up Oh snaps and I just saw her pop up in the chat so it's got a debate right now um yo Don mega I I think we had a couple really awesome conversations it does it does feel a little light right now but I think the time that we had we we packed it in with with a bunch of a great opinions great conversations about gaming and uh I don't know I had a lot of fun tonight you guys um should we be just be awkwardly quiet yeah yeah hold on wait for it wait talk now oh all right but but guys we got to get our plugs in man we got to do our outros all that good stuff and we're gonna we're going to start with the man with the Dead Sea Scrolls for appearances and that would be my brother Kate mega yo mega why don't you let people know where you're going to be throughout the week and where they can get ahold of you man oh man oh you can get a hold of me by coming to and supporting my channel K mega 405 on YouTube I'm also have a vid me with mrs. K mega 4 or 5 I'm going to be streaming tonight you know on mixer so coming to enjoy me and if you know if you want to play some tech in or whatever that we're going to be playing you know come and join me I'm saying this is a gamers community also definitely big shout out to intro media gaming you know much love for that group all my crew also the grg podcast which is every Friday night after crossfire appreciate the people that's been supporting us beyond our xx we had our 20th episode last night that was a it time flies man and indeed but it was awesome also on the multiplayer I can't do the multiplayer all the time but what I do is just wild and crazy also here you catch me here and the Big Daddy of amalia I'm saying be GST just man a lot of a lot going on man but yeah a big shout-out to everybody and thank you guys for hanging out with us nice nice dude uh yo Don why don't you let people know I know you dropped you drop the video recently that even uh our boy kraut gamer is using kind of like to help leverage people out with the whole frames-per-second thing so why don't you let people know what what you've been up to and how they can get a hold of you man I thought that was I didn't know that was public information but I regret no no I do have a channel called happy little polygons I don't really give a lot of the opinion pieces just because that's not what it's there for you know a lot of times that sometimes feels like really hardcore fan bases and that's not I'm a developer at the end of the day I have a preference towards Xbox but I don't have any hate towards any other platform so as I try not to do that but there was a definitely controversial thing on take on 30 frames and 60 frames and every time I try to talk to something about people were very very closed-minded in not wanting to look at that man those full details in regards that in you know um and you know people were you know getting to the point where they were taking my stuff completely out of context and so I'm just like okay I am not nearly as big as cliffy B or Phil Spencer so you should be taking my [ __ ] out of context at all right um so I just kind of laid it out I gave the full picture so people can see where I'm coming from on that and so if you are curious it is a happy little polygons it's just an opinion piece on 30 frames first and 60 frames it's actually my most hated video which is 3 hates right now so if you want to give that a thumbs down or you want to get a thumbs up I'd appreciate the view regardless in regards to that I don't live off of YouTube so this is you know just the way for me to reach back out through the damage in other way yeah exactly like it really doesn't matter you either way to me I just I always try to speak the truth I always try to empower gamers uh what what I'm here to do is you know but I if I don't say truthful things guess what happens then publishers and other developers don't take me seriously so I have to take some stance when things are more when it's about factual stuff I have to go with that stuff and my understanding for them for me to have credibility so that's why I did the video that I did so people stop taking things out of context but if you enjoy that sort of stuff you want to hear my take on it's there otherwise you can follow me on Twitter the links below on on this and I encourage you to do that because I am about to send out the video of Kofi be and have everybody here and podcast tagged in it so beautiful beautiful uh and guys like I said before I believe we had we had an absolutely awesome show I love I know it wasn't as many topics as I put in a DM but I think we really covered you know the the meat of it and I really had a lot of fun talking talking about this stuff with you guys and you know having everybody in the chat hang out with us on another Saturday night guys I do have to say I appreciate all the support for this podcast this panel my channel Megas channel like you the community has been absolutely incredible I thank you guys so much she'll definitely share this podcast I'll share Kate Megas channel out share grg out let's show everybody what the gaming community is all about but as for now I'm running late I have to go I have to go pick up oh snaps we are going to be streaming seven days to die tonight I cannot wait I want to see the the Minecraft aspects into in this kind of like zombie apocalyptic world and stuff so I am hype for that oh snaps is going to be streaming that on her channel oh snap its Mel uh but I know the gamers want to get the controllers in their hands so guys we got to let everybody go so I'm going to say like I say every Saturday check you next Saturday for the next podcast oh and by the way next week special

Click CC button at bottom right to turn off! In biology, there are often vocabulary terms\nthat sound pretty similar. Chromosome. Chromatid. Chromatin. Transcription. Translation. Mitosis. Meiosis. You probably have encountered this. When I was first learning about mitosis and\nmeiosis, I learned them both separately first. And then I tried to figure out what was the\nsame about them, what was different, why did they both matter? I would try to compare the stages by flipping\nthrough images. You know what would have helped me? A side by side comparison. And that\u2019s what this video is. We assume you already have a background of\nmitosis and meiosis---if not take a look at our videos on them---but this video is a side\nby side comparison. Presented in a split screen. Mitosis on the left. Meiosis on the right. Both of these processes, along with the cytokinesis\nthat follows them to split the cytoplasm, are involved in making new cells. Mitosis results in body cells. Meiosis results in sperm and egg cells, otherwise\nknows as the fancy term, gametes. Before we start mitosis and meiosis, let\u2019s\nlook at what you start with. Your starting cell in both mitosis and meiosis\nis diploid, written here as 2n. That means it has 2 sets of chromosomes---in\nhumans, that\u2019s including one set of 23 chromosomes from mom and one set of 23 chromosomes from\ndad. 46 chromosomes total in humans. During interphase, the cell duplicates the\nchromosomes. When you duplicate 46 chromosomes, you still\nsay there are 46 chromosomes as the newly duplicated portion is still attached at the\ncentromere region---but there are actually 92 chromatids. Interphase isn\u2019t part of mitosis or meiosis,\nbut it\u2019s a really important phase because it duplicates chromosomes before we get started. Just to point out, it\u2019s really hard to draw\n46 chromosomes which is how many humans have. We\u2019re going to use 6 chromosomes in our\ndiagrams when we illustrate what\u2019s happening because it\u2019s much easier to draw and visualize. Oh and just a fun fact: some insects have\n6 chromosomes. Like mosquitoes. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of mosquitoes. But mosquitoes do mitosis and meiosis too. When learning the stages, we give the acronym\nPMAT which is helpful for understanding the stages. Both mitosis and meiosis go through these\nstages, but meiosis goes through them twice and therefore has a number next to each PMAT\nstage. We\u2019re going to show some basic events for\neach PMAT stage, but please know there is way more detail to explore than what we can\ninclude in this quick video. Prophase in mitosis. Remember that \u201cpro\u201d can mean \u201cbefore\u201d\nand this stage comes before the others. The chromosomes are visible; in fact, we say\nthey\u2019re condensing which means they are thickening. Prophase I in meiosis. Happening here too, but the chromosomes are\nactually going to match up with their homologous pairs. The word homologous means that the chromosomes\nare approximately the same size and that they contain the same types of genes in the same\nlocations. With each pair, one came from mom and one\ncame from dad. In this formation, chromosomes can transfer\ntheir genetic information and exchange it between each other. It\u2019s called crossing over! It can make for what we call recombinant chromosomes. Metaphase in mitosis. The nuclear envelope which had surrounded\nthe nucleus was already disassembled before metaphase started. For metaphase, I like to remember the M for\nmiddle because in this stage the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell in a single\nfile line. Metaphase I in meiosis. The chromosomes are in the middle as well,\nbut they\u2019re still going to be in pairs in the middle of the cell so it\u2019s not a single\nfile line. Anaphase in mitosis. I like to think as the A is for \u201caway.\u201d The chromatids are pulled away by the work\nof the spindles. They are moving to the opposite sides of the\ncell. Anaphase I in meiosis. Same thing but in this case, it\u2019s the chromosomes-\nnot chromatids- being pulled away to opposite sides of the cell. Telophase in mitosis and telophase I in meiosis. The chromosomes are at the complete opposite\nends and new nuclei are forming on each side to make these two new cells. And they are starting to surround the chromosomes\non both sides as this will eventually form 2 cells. Cytokinesis follows to split the cytoplasm\nto complete the actual dividing of the cell. So at the end of mitosis and cytokinesis,\nwe end with two identical, diploid cells. In humans, they would both have 46 chromosomes. This is great for organism growth---growing\nrequires making more cells after all---or replacing damaged cells. On to meiosis II! Prophase II. Chromosomes condensing in both cells. It\u2019s not going to be as eventful as it was\nin prophase I because they are not going to have homologous pairs and crossing over. Metaphase II. M for middle, but this time, the chromosomes\nare in a single file line. Similar to how metaphase looked in mitosis. Anaphase II. Think A for away. This time, though, it\u2019s actually the chromatids\nthat are getting pulled away. Telophase II. Chromosomes are at the complete opposite ends\nand new nuclei are forming on each side to make new cells. Cytokinesis will follow meiosis II to completely\nsplit the cytoplasm. We are now finished with meiosis: and we end\nwith four non-identical cells. Gametes. Males makes sperm cells in meiosis and females\nmake egg cells in meiosis. These gametes are haploid, meaning they have\nhalf the number of chromosomes as the original starting cell. In the case of humans, the resulting cells\nwould each have 23 chromosomes. By the way, when a sperm and egg cell combine,\nit results into a diploid cell, a fertilized egg otherwise known as a zygote, which will\nthen start a series of divisions using mitosis to give rise to a brand new organism.

bowl out of here push him out that super is so good and we win let's see if we can do spread and showdown is it gonna be good or is it gonna be bad all right I'm gonna take what that box I don't know if that uh eight bit knows what's up but I'm sprout and I'm losing oh dear heck wait why did I block him from that this is not a good idea he really wants to power up it's like that bow is confused he doesn't quite know what's up did I waste my super on that I feel like I did I should have blocked him better oh my gosh 12 power Jackie we got a team on this Jackie that's illegal oh my gosh that's almost one hit to kill me I don't know Carl is that Bob Carl how am I not dead yet you can tell it's a bot if it swerves like 12 degrees okay not 12 but if it just does abrupt turns freakin block Carl get out of here nobody takes my power cubes hey I think it gets confused by the vines could I have beaten that Carl maybe if I wasn't bloated a trophies star tokens absolute win huh oh this has a lot

net can I get out of this matchmaking already this is absurd we've got the star token that we won be cool Oh J be cool digest all that grass-fed beef that you just had and your you'll be good oh my gosh 500 boxes though I got robbed let's do siege no big deal just just that just the Jackie she got nerfed right she's not that scary oh nice Rico oh I'm amazing it bounces so far I love it even without the star power it's still so good heck and Nita I almost feel like I don't even want to use my super right now nope now we're good okay a little fast there I could have taken out that Nita though just saying no I mean uh I couldn't blocked Anita okay this is gonna take some getting used to what it bounced off the Nita that's illegal okay Jackie I don't yeah you got no busier Jackie heck and heck you know I don't want to block my own bought that be absurd I don't even know it no just Rico shoot we're only fourteen hundred away this is painful I wonder if I came back to her I feel like

sprout it's so good now I don't even have the star power the gadget yet sprout I'm in love with you heal 3000 with the gadget you can use it three times in the match over growth seed bombs that don't make contact explode with an even larger explosion that's absurd 10/10 i recommend sprout 0:10 I do not recommend spending 350 gems on this because you will unlock it eventually through the boxes if you're not maxed out there's even more reason to open boxes until you eventually get it there's no rush to get sprout but if you are rush to get sprout make sure to rush in to use code okay when you spend the gems I hope you guys know it it's a little bit different a little bit goofy err and thank you again to Kairos for inspiring need to do something super goofy check out his channel no doubt he definitely ate grass 100% what the hell I don't know if he did but I'm I'm certain he did something absurd that's it for this video hope you guys enjoyed it thanks for watching and stay tuned for more

you are one of a global audience divided around 400 million people or tuned in for this game the greatest game ever faked for your thumb an audit the talking the build-up to the game now it's all about the football practice certainly to coaches that remarkably composed Guardiola and josie marino play nice all about the football body owners picked it low-key so nice can let you see hopefully Lakes team Duda talk to you on the peach [Applause] where's general now they've got the ball cue the booze well handled right Valdez a very tricky slippery conditions and we just that he met brain before a game to his status continued and who might for a slick surface dani alves then I'll mess is still awaiting his first touch of the ball with five minutes gone looked like a corner assistant didn't give it necie picks up and go to the spot the ball appeared to be glue trees foot DeMaria clearly takes takes the ball out of play tenacious as ever miss he wins it back the balls glued to his foot getting to their passing game you see Missy curling in off the far post almost exactly trying to go be Casillas chip Casillas daddy controlling his mana messy caressing the ball to Iniesta he has vehicle apps outside inside [Applause] a huge source of love which is a slightly look you throw girl but to see Chevy that for advanced at the beat and broke the offside trap these thoughts little early to finish the round Madrid with defending deep took the Barcelona keeping it low-key this we can open the sky and Iniesta slide for all paths can be tested in an on-site position gets lucky with the first touch but he's got the awareness he's got the ability there to beat Casillas with a death little flick when he's right for opens the scoring for Barcelona cheffy in the center for position from Jerry that was magical Cristiano Ronaldo break ball inside bozhil team area spots the gas takes a firefighters I guess he's not hurting now big safe so soon off the bus lobo - the story back from rama trick quick counter-attacking there's a foul off the ball that a game good advantage given as it's at the feet of Cristiano Ronaldo the point of what's gonna happen it top tax but if that could have been a very embarrassing own goal by Abby now and another important save I fell Dez he had some footage happening the way that during on his head tune grandma dude look really then she doesn't take more than one touch [Applause] I'm also not least by the referee faster continue who davit via toe to toe with Ramos gets the cross [Applause] Jose's not smiling now just like my football there was only after our life but 20 plaque passes rama - it didn't make a tackle but but to get more physical but guts confront the pyramid shirts at Barcelona the camp back in position get back behind the ball that is far too easy for Barcelona in it in further of the pitch the stretching around Madrid back for runners from deep runners from white positions Brown but you just can't cloaked at a moment you see the bull switch that whites at David Van he's taking on Ramos he's only gonna try and gets in a buyer line [Applause] scrambled away by a peak assess real madrid are rattled Cristiano Ronaldo [Applause] I thought the would be intentionally going everywhere but there's been one or two technicals not to come to all these yet [Applause] [Music] the situation - Valdez rush 50 yards to say his bit to Christian Josie arena this is that's what it's all about would have gone down everything want to dirty that very expensive coat [Applause] you want to do about nothing isn't it [Applause] - Valdez we got into pushing it with Marino Tierney was meant to be a manager Cristiano Ronaldo has to watch its step now having also been booked it's not the referee could be put into this round red performance Aleksey goes down he's not one to take a diet but there was a connection with Cavalia this is a big call to the referee what's your mark Livonia got involved with Messi my good tackle it wasn't a dive for me seems a fair challenge from Papa neo we've been accused Messi of diving and I think Cal Valley Oak and Canton so porch that were he didn't see I don't think he's seen that well DC mess he goes to ground and he's guest they've won the last two here and there in a very good position in the first half well it's living up to the expectations the most eagerly anticipated game of football in Europe it's Barcelona who are bossing it shows a petulance of Cristiano Ronaldo one of five players booked in the first half but he and Leo Messi the names are in the book though their names are not on the score sheet the score is in the first half Shammi and pedro welcome back to the Camp Nou Barcelona against Real Madrid says it all at halftime Lassana Diarra is coming on measured Oziel is the player who's going to be sacrificed for the second half I think it's a mission there from Jose a marine that you probably know Barcelona have bossed the first half they'd had the steamroller effect on Robert red who's been chasing around a special one is a beaten one at the moment yet but not finished yet now Messi drifting driving there typical part ago [Applause] but the team report tonight around the trip it's a great tarnish it comes was pretty possum in there from there no machine that idea [Applause] in party much time afforded to the Barcelona attacking players without grandma to closing him down again trying to use an offside trap [Applause] putted veer had time to work across the line hold ease run back to the perfect moment where they very smoothly with little messy messy instant [Applause] mr. fisherman will be searched I just love that class inside the phone black security of white players feet [Applause] run across class we seed the pass inside the full-back essentially then it becomes a one-on-one versus the goalkeeper and David beard doesn't miss a superb goal this team are really really special they look up to they haven't around a drip Dobson I'm not done but beans who got holes in the last five minutes [Music] a lot so steps over the ball long hopefully shot as we mentioned earlier what this is a young Real Madrid team a lot of players in there [Applause] Chile was promised goes over to Spanish international team made dab administer fear invested to get straight back up onto his feet to prevent the caution which is going to come his way the whole stadia acknowledges performance from Jerry [Applause] bata gets a taste of the glory [Applause] their fifth as well into stoppage time bones cross I'm sorry jack furthest out -

kerchief Department everybody's there 3k how do you fly things up a plat du where the instrument rates more than the host Paul is expected tonight they expected a closer encounter we can see there a beaten scene from Real Madrid tonight the youngster Jeff Wren breaks into the box all that picture of all of the team celebrating together on the touchline a terrible tackle from Cavalia and he's been very updated as a danos [Applause] so the referee saw that in sneaking in passing as a system that was the first bow necklace that Leo's offense messy messy taken down as well my suit I think takes them and they see boskie won't be pleased to see Spanish team fight amongst each other do your grandma's Chevy pk [Applause] Jose Mourinho is solutely flawed he said last year when they lost against Barcelona but still went through the Champions League it was the most beautiful loss of his life tonight is certain of the ugliest loss of his life [Applause] and the picture says he old isn't it for

[Music]", "AZy5CoKWK04": "what's happening everyone my name is Alex and welcome back in case you're not gonna show the differences between the original Apple earpods Pro and some fake Apple earpods Pro now I've done a similar video about three or four months ago but the fake ones that I've had in that video war and dad cratered and there are a lot of things that you can see and you can tell that they're fake but the ones that I have today look so close to the original ones that it's almost impossible to tell that they are fake so these ones are called the super pots pro 2.0 and you can find this for about 50 dollars and usually you can find the fake ones for between thirty to seventy dollars depending when and where you buy them of course and what happens a lot of people buy the fake ones and then they resell them as original ones so the original Apple earpods for about two hundred and fifty dollars and you definitely don't spend like two hundred and fifty dollars on a pair of airports and then find out you actually have some fake ones so with this become hoping that I'm gonna make it easier for you to spot the fake ones so you don't end up buying the fake ones believing that you're buying the original ones alright so you're gonna start by checking out the boxes and how they're wrapped so they're both wrapped in plastic when you get them now the main difference here is that the original Apple earpods Pro have a little plastic tab that you can pull so you cannot open the box easier basically pull that wrap on from the box so definitely check for that and look for that because most fake ones even though they come wrapped in plastic the plastic looks kind of cheap and you don't usually have that pull out tab so you can easily take off the plastic wrap after you remove that plastic wrap well the boxes do look fairly similar even though the blacks are a bit deeper and on the original ones in certain places but looking at those stickers will even the stickers you can't exactly tell if you're looking at the original ones or the fake ones because the stickers may be different depending on the country that you actually buy the airport's from so some airports that you're gonna buy in China may actually be different than the box from some airports that you're gonna buy in the US so the stickers here even though they're a bit different you're not gonna be able to tell which ones are the fake ones and which ones are the real ones by looking at those stickers so the boxes themselves do look fairly similar and it could be kind of tough telling which ones are the original ones and which ones are the fake ones just by looking at the boxes if you don't have both boxes with you the first thing you're gonna find in the box is the user manual and at the first glance they do look very similar but looking closer at the first page you're gonna notice some differences on the original one it says Apple earpods proof we're on the fake ones it says an iOS so this is something that you should look for so look on the first page of the user manual in the box you're also gonna find the cable and the replacement of ear cups but this one's look fairly similar so kind of difficult to tell if you are looking at the fake ones or the real ones so the cable and the replacement ear cups are kind of similar but yeah you'll find the same thing in both boxes for the fake ones and the original ones next we are moving on to the charging cases and at the first glance the charging cases do look very similar on the front the back and the bottom so at the bottom we have the same on the Lightning port and on the back we have the same color round hinge and the same text well somewhat the same text because on some of them says Made in China on the fake ones it says Made in China where on the original ones it says Made in Vietnam but this could be different depending on the country that you actually buy this from and the main difference that I've noticed for the charging case is it's the LED on the front there so if you look close enough on the original ones you'll notice that the LEDs are the same level as the plastic we're on the fake ones the LED is actually lower so where the hole for the LED is on the fake ones it looks a bit darker than it looks on the original ones so this is something that you should look for both cases also support wireless charging so you can charge either of them by just placing them on a charging map so that LED is the only thing that I've noticed different on the charging cases opening the charging case well once again they do look very similar but if you look at top there you're gonna notice that the text is a bit different so when you see the serial number on the fake ones and the Polish see it on the originals now keep in mind that the serial number on the fake ones actually matches the serial number on the box isn't expecting that by yes they do match but look at the text there and how long it is on the original ones and how it looks on the fake ones so that could be something that you couldn't look for next we are checking out the air pass themselves and I have to say that the fake ones look very very close to the original ones it's almost impossible to tell which ones are the fake ones and which ones are the original ones and the only difference that I ever noticed is for that text where we get the serial number keep in mind that the serial number on the fake ones also matches the box so something that I wasn't expecting so the serial number on the fake one seems to be a bit darker so the text is a bit darker than the text that we get on the original ones on the original ones the text almost looks like grayish in color we're on the fake ones it's darker so a bit closer to black but that is really the only difference that I was able to notice between the fake ones and Oh original ones as soon as you open the case you're also gonna get a pop-up message on your iPhone and take a closer look at that popup message because it is a bit different from the fake ones to the original ones so look and see how it looks for the original ones and how it looks from the fake ones if you're getting the message on your phone from the frequency you're probably looking at some fake Apple earpods Pro but yes you do get that same pop up message when you first open up the case and parent those on air but with your phone once connected to your phone once again it is difficult to tell if you have the fake ones or the original ones because you get the same actions you get the noise cancelling options or the transparency option you can select in-between them from the phone or from the air pads themselves now keep in mind that to the fake ones even though it shows like they have is canceling nothing actually happens when you turn on the noise canceling if you're using the original once and you have them in your ears and you turn on the noise canceling you're definitely gonna notice the difference if you have the fake ones in your ears and you turn on the noise canceling nothing happens so if you get that far in a transaction that could be something that you could tell the team you're looking at some fake ones and/or some original ones so these fake ones these particular fake ones don't actually have noise canceling either than that the fake ones work just like the original ones so every time you take one out of your ear the music will stop you can skip to the next song you can go to the previous song and you can also access Siri so that works the same and the only difference is the fact that the fake ones don't support the noise canceling everything else above functionality is pretty much the same with the fake ones and original ones as for the sound quality one of the original ones do sound a bit better they get a bit louder they have a bit more bass but the fake ones aren't that bad they actually sound a bit better than the original Apple earpods so if you are knowingly buying these fake ones for 50 bucks they don't actually sound bad for 50 bucks they'll say I mean there are a couple of other earbuds that you can buy that sound a bit better run for fifty dollars but they don't look like these ones so if you're buying this for yourself and you're just wearing them nobody's ever gonna know that you actually have some fake ones so there you have it these are the main differences between the fake ones and as I said these ones are the best fake ones that I've seen so far and I'm sure that in the near future we're actually gonna see fake ones that have real noise cancelling as well so hopefully I made it a bit easier to spot the fake ones but realistically if you're buying some Apple earpods just buy them from some authorized Apple reseller or run directly from the Apple store because this way you know that you're gonna buy the real one set and you're not gonna end up on having some fake ones that you actually paid $250 for alright guys hopefully enjoyed this video if you did like it don't forget to press that like button don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys in the next one thanks for

time we got the new air pods air pods - some people are calling them that everybody else is kind of saying their one point five one point something else there's a reason that the new version is similar to the old version it's kind of complicated how Apple released it though in the sense that there's a few different ways that you can actually purchase the new air pods so on the far left here the new air pods inside of the new wireless charging case I think this is probably the only product they needed to put out but for some reason they let you buy the new air pods - without the wireless charging case now this one is available for a hundred and fifty-nine dollars which is the same price as the air pods one but without the wireless charging case there's really like no way to tell the difference but nonetheless they are the upgraded newer model to take it a step further they're also selling the wireless charge case on its own and this thing is gonna be $79 and you can then take your first-generation air pods these ones and pop them into the wireless charge case or you could upgrade the non wireless charge case version of the air pods - and then pick this up at a later date although that wouldn't be a very smart decision cost wise because when you combine the prices of these two you got 159 + 79 bringing you above the retail price if you just get them together right here I've talked about the air pods in the past if you want a cheaper wireless charge case I actually demoed a version of that for this product here it's like a rubber case from a company called East Brooklyn labs it's cheaper than the official wireless charge case and it adds wireless charging to this that's a way to go but the thing to remember here is it's not just wireless charging there's a bit of a dispute right now happening online I watch a few videos if the sound of the new air pods is any better than the old air pods according to marques Apple said there is no difference but there are some internal improvements to the air pods - first up you can now launch Siri with your voice it's also got a new chip inside which is apparently a bit better for battery and is gonna connect to your devices a little bit faster and then the other thing that come along with that new internal chip is the fact that there's less latency that's the only way you're gonna know if you're on version 2 as well as this little LED light on the front right there let's get this out of the box now I do like wireless charging as well so that functionality is worthwhile to me especially on a product like this you already got to charge your phone if you could have a map actually speaking of a mat on the wireless charge case only they showcase the air power mat fresh pair oh I notice another visual difference right away on the backside there this is glossy reflective this is a matte finish on version 2 air pod visually identical to the previous version okay so for those of you unfamiliar with wireless charging here's how that works this is a basic Qi compatible wireless charger you can find these on Amazon for like a few bucks and then you drop your headphones on there and boom orange light wirelessly charging how simple is that for the purpose of this testing in order to get to the bottom of the sound issue and whether or not there is a discrepancy I've got an iPhone here alright this is the 10 s max let's go ahead and pair these up look at the chip go into action the ecosystem Apple on Apple this is what you get connect it's all it takes again another advantage of this chip and this behavior the connection between the two Apple products you get this really nice battery readout though I found a cool app on the Android side if you do use air pods on Android air battery it basically replicates the Apple experience with a giant ugly add and look at that you can pretend you have an iPhone when you pair up your air pods it's actually very useful because it tells you your battery as well hundred percent 100 percent 25 percent of course it's not official this is official and this is very quick on the Apple side so I'm going to remove these this is series 2 and now I guess we should boot up some music maybe they're a little louder should I get another iPhone so I can quickly a be it his version one remember to get the Zack same track same source same foam earpods one air Potts - just one year okay right year air pause number one left ear air pots - I'm gonna flip yours just to make sure my ears are not the problem here I wanna take that out do this take this out do this now I have air pod wanting left air pod - and right alright I've concluded though there's no difference I thought for a moment but that's the crazy part about this you really need some strong a/b testing to know for certain couple different songs couple different genres if there's any difference I'm telling you right now it's minuscule the old versus the new I don't think the reason to get the new ones is sound alright I think I could pretty confidently say that based on my little test right here there really is only one major reason to upgrade which is the wireless charge case that's a simple little obvious convenience factor and how big of a deal that is depends really on you and how much you value the opportunity to do that but unfortunately the wireless charge case if you just want to upgrade your version one is really expensive it's 80 bucks just the case on its own so I'm not sure that that's worthwhile either I would say you're looking at version two if you don't have a pair yet or if you're version one aren't holding a charge maybe the battery is kind of killed on them then you could be looking towards version two this is a convenience thing it's a form factor thing these tiny little packages you put in your pocket you don't even realize or remember that it's a dare which is good that's what you want it's so small and so convenient that you find yourself reaching for it inevitably that's why I made that video about the air pod confession that's why I'm using these things on an Android phone it's a very low friction device and that's why these are attractive to people and other manufacturers need to take note so there his version - you heard the differences wireless charging slightly better battery life faster connection and lower latency but they sound like the first generation look like the first generation and basically behave like the first generation if you have a first generation I'd say stick it out no need to upgrade not at the moment", "1U-k8QSLH6c": "[Music] uh [Music] [Music] suddenly you're nowhere to be found i turn around and everything has changed looking for a way to work it out i'm trying to find some piece to navigate the oak tree where i met you and the [Music] what's up guys welcome back to another video today i'm gonna be showcasing my rank 35 mr p grind with the help of my friend pixel dragon um this push took about three days on three different maps or you know four different maps scorched stone stormy plains rock overall and double trouble i'm gonna be reviewing my tips and tricks throughout this portion of the video and then the rest i'll just let you guys watch without further ado let's get right into it alrighty hopping into the first game here we spawn on the right hand side so we're just going to pick up these two cubes that are next to our spawn one thing important on this map is to get as much cubes as possible in the beginning and then just pressure every other team you can rush mid but you want to be careful so one team goes in and then the other one protects uh as you can see here um pixel is the one that goes in um the one protecting we see that there's people rushing mid so we just third party and basically you also want to use your porters uh your gadget when you are pushing a team so then they waste their ammo on the porters and then once you come in you can just kill them and yeah that's basically it for the first game okay into the second game we get spawn on the bottom left so there's two teams beside us one on the right and then one on top of us we're gonna grab these cubes as fast as possible and check who's mid and so there's a jackie and we're just gonna farm super and um third party whoever contests us um yeah so usually if you have a lot of cubes on this map most teams will back off if not if they just you know fight back then you can kill them also uh i would recommend just getting cubes in front of you and then going mid and then if there's more cubes uh around the perimeter you can get that afterwards and i'm not sure why this bee was spinning maybe she knew who we were i don't know but yeah we just pick up the kill and pressure this byron to the top left i believe yeah okay so i just shoot um behind the walls to pressure the byron and once you get super you just want to place it down as fast as possible because it helps push other teams and yeah we kill the byron b team gail manages to escape unfortunately uh but i do get the kill actually so never mind um so it's showdown and it's uh mr p and max so and they have two power cubes so yeah it's a win basically so that will be all that i'm commentating because other games are pretty similar to this and yeah i hope you guys enjoy and i'll let you guys watch the rest a pair of jeans just shut up too we didn't practice if we weren't going back it doesn't matter if it's true i've got a feeling love will give us what we like the world is waiting up the world is waiting

content creator i'm an unabashed generalist so in today's video i will be offering uh some commentary on vh1's basketball lives season 9 episode 5. let's start with some church announcements yes this video is technically later than i would have liked it to be but you know health is wealth and i have to prioritize my health um yeah and another thing that happened uh and this is sort of like church announcements that's going to segue into the actual commentary of the video people on twitter are the most unreliable narrators ever and i say that honestly the tweets from the people who actually watched the show had to be paid uh bots from team shawnee and team evelyn because i am going to be honest i thought that you know this episode will paint og in a negative light because of all the flack she received in this episode so now let me come in and put on my cape and save the day i will go in chronological order because frankly this episode was good but for all the wrong reasons so let's start with uh malaysia and um jackie reconcile i'll be looking at my notes in this video sorry not sorry and so malaysia says because of everything that's going on she wants peace but how many times does she have to forgive jackie for betraying her if you saw there was a bit of a bait and switch malaysia doesn't actually know why she is upset with jackie other than the fact that she can't lash out at the true culprits who spread or brought the rumor to fruition and by that i mean it was evelyn and it was kristen who heard about uh malaysia's kids being dirty and they brought it to vh1 and by that i mean they knew the cameras were rolling they didn't have to uh mention this they chose to do that and malaysia somehow took debate first she was going to go after jennifer but evelyn knew that uh jennifer was her flunky so she decided to put the target on jackie's back which is why i don't have any respect for jackie because how many times does evelyn have to show you who she is before you believe her evelyn has talked about your daughter she's talked about multiple people in your life she's accused you of being a bad mother like when do you just believe that evelyn is who she showed you she is everyone even went so far as to get you and one of your good girlfriends uh into an argument to save her flunky but you know i have no use for jackie uh malaysia did say something to jackie that made me think there's an interesting power dynamic relationship here and that was i don't want to feel like i'm your little sister and that any of my legitimate complaints you you you know sweep under the rug and i understand where malaysia is coming from but then malaysia wants to target jackie because like i said she can't target evelyn or kristen and frankly that's malaysia's own issue that she has to work on if i were jackie i would be cordial with malaysia but i wouldn't trust her with a 10-foot pole because once people show you who they are it's incumbent upon you to believe them shauni is talking to the new girls nya and noria um they are getting on my nerves in the interest of full disclosure too uh i can't remember if it was naya or naraya whatever one of the sisters basically said well you know we talked to ochi and she shared something personal that her teacher told her yes i know they are filming a reality tv show so it was bound to get out anyway but it was not uh the sister's place to tell shawnee that shawnee has officially disgusted me by saying well what did she say shaunie says that uh they she thanked the sisters for telling her that and said that it humanized oh gee this is exactly what og is talking about when she says there's a colorism issue why does ochi need to be humanized based on some traumatic experience that she suffered as a little girl in elementary school if you don't remember og said in episode 4 that one of her elementary school teachers said you will never amount to anything because of the color of your skin and for og to open up and be vulnerable and tell that to gin um jackie and the sisters i thought was a big deal now the sisters had no uh rhyme or reason to go back and try to bridge the gap between og and shawnee and for og to say oh this humanizes uh for shawnee to say oh this humanizes og for us i think it showed uh piss poor judgement on shawnee's part shawnee has allowed herself to get away with uh statements that she said in the moment which is contemporaneous and then when she does the green screen she tries to play the cleanup woman and tries to you know put a lipstick on a pig but you know i believe what shawnee said in that contemporaneous moment to the sisters you know basically showed us who shawnee is she is mean-spirited she's malice she's miserable and she actually took some sort of uh glee from hearing that og had something horrible said to her as a kid oh well that makes me think that you know oh she is a human og never said she was superwoman y'all said she was superwoman because she played football and she was quote unquote masculine according to the mean girls but chad ocho cinco still wanted her so what's real tea and so shawnee also said that she's only experienced og fussing and fighting and arguing uh i think that shawnee is projecting she's only experienced that with her good girlfriend evelyn when has og always been fuss and fighting and arguing and that's how you know there's a colorism issue because uh og has not even done one tenth of what evelyn malaysia or even jennifer has done or jackie yes she's the aggressive one she's the one who needs to be segregated she's the one who needs to you know open up and admit that there is no colorism issue and that they just don't like her because she stood up to their uh flawed failed initiation and frankly i'm tired of it i really am shawnee then continues to tell the sisters well i would love to talk to og now that i know what you guys have told me about her but it can't be a space where og is saying i'm right you're wrong that's exactly what all the other women are doing so why can't og stand on her square and say there's a colorism issue there's a issue with xenophobia and frankly i'm kind of disappointed in og for not calling out the xenophobia because this is more to do about xenophobia and colorism and racism but i think the number one issue now as i'm seeing it is the xenophobia og is um from nigeria and these women hate that she is not what they would consider classically beautiful yet she has um the confidence of a woman who they would consider classically beautiful so that reminds me oh she could smile and they would say oh she's being fake she's being aggressive so these women have determined that og was going to be the problem and they have enlisted the aid of production to uh bring that to fruition and frankly i'm not here for it at all i see through it we get a scene where oh gee and jen are talking oh gee is going like this arts and crafts uh pocket book she is i'll admit og probably isn't the best multitasker but you could tell that jennifer is looking for a reason to slither her uh herself back over to team colorism and the color is a mansion uh this is pretty much big brother on vh1 jen and og have never been friends i don't even think they've really filmed too many scenes together they are in the house with jackie because evelyn and sean wouldn't allow them to be in the mansion with them and that again goes to the colorism and the xenophobia how is it that shawnee feels safer with a woman who has thrown wine bottles thrown glasses and tried to fight every season she was on the show but og is the issue make them make deposits because that'll never make dollars more sense jen is talking to og og is focused on doing her arts and crafts pocket book uh and then we get a real nasty scene where jen basically is like you know why she says something about your man doesn't play uh sport he doesn't play basketball but jen is divorced and the last two men she was with are in prison so again make that make deposits because that'll never make dollars more sense the projection on this show is you know it's through the roof and why should uh og have to look at jim while she's talking about nothing and this whole og is the problem and she's self-censored it's like no jim you're the problem and you're the one who's self-centered i was just honestly confused and this is why i say that the people on twitter are horrible narrators because i got the sense that you know oh she actually has done something and when i'm watching it i had to watch this show twice just to make sure that my judgment wasn't clouded and each time i watched it i was like production is heavy-handed and most of the people watching this show who are team colorism are stupid there's no other way for me to put it i'm not going to use high falutin language stupidity is stupidity it is what it is the sisters looking for a moment end up laying the foundation for the og is the problem in advance of or in um defense of team colorism uh naya i believe dated uh february's excellence and uh naraya noria however you pronounce her name as with some dude named sean taggart and they basically tell malaysia and kristen about what happened with og uh basically why is it the sisters issue who put a battery in their back and told them hey we need you to go and be og's mouthpiece other than production i'm understanding why they're upset that og was upset about that kristen and malaysia being the mean spirited girls that they are hearing about og's juvenile trauma and say oh well this would be a perfect way to connect with her like you know i've been open and honest about the fact that i've had a spinal cord injury and one of the reasons i don't have a lot of friends who have physical disabilities is because i don't want to bond over trauma right like i had a good friend and it was a young woman and we used to bond over our trauma and that was the most unhealthy situationship i had ever been in in my life because she used to want me to tell her in vivid detail you know oh well what happened the day you had your spinal cord injury you know what did it feel like and then she would tell me about some of the traumatic issues in her life now don't get me wrong that's what therapy is for i am not a therapist yes i let my friends vent to me and yes i did to my friends but it's not an everyday occurrence um and even if it is an everyday occurrence it's not um me emotionally dumping on her and so i just basically had to let that friendship go because it was like every time we would talk she would want me to tap into that reservoir of that 13 year old boy having a spinal cord injury and this is why i felt like a lot of people pissed me off and i was sort of triggered about this oh geez had a traumatic experience in her life well she's human live long enough and you will go through some sort of harrowing traumatic experience in your life but don't use that to try to guilt trip or you know segue into absolving yourself of responsibility og is standing on our corner saying there's colorism in this issue that's just what they're going to have to contend with and deconstruct whatever happened to ogie as a little girl has no bearings on her accurately describing the colorism and the group if anything she knows about colorism because she's experienced it but you're not going to say she's having a referred emotional response or a delayed emotional response based on what happens to her in elementary school and she's just lashing out and like i said on twitter uh so y'all need to tell me that evelyn is able to fist fight she's able to throw objects she's able to curse people out she's able to weaponize your children against you but she's not a colorist that makes sense to y'all come on now and i know a lot of black people unfortunately don't want to talk about this because there are colorists in almost every black family let's not act like you know there's a whole book don't play in the sun how many of us grew up being told don't play in the sun you might get dark or you know i had a family member tell me when he saw me damn bro you're getting dark as if that's a bad thing i was never light skinned or white like yes if i decide to sun tan i will get dark that's why black people have to use sunscreen and so this whole you know notion that og is just making it up and evelyn is this you know submissive docile sweet person where where did that come from that's how you know evelyn is not black because she would a black woman in this historical moment in the western hemisphere in america would not be treated with the kid gloves that evelyn lozada is being treated with the sisters go back to jackie's mansion and they tell oh gee oh well we took it upon ourselves to tell uh shawnee what you told us and og says matter of factly that's not your place you can't uh bridge this divide we have to do it ourselves you are not allowed to bring a bone and take a bone uh to shawnee and then bring it back to me and one of the sisters does a confessional and it's like it's not what you say is how you say it y'all do not get to reveal something personal even if this was one recorded for a tv show and then use that weaponize that and then when you don't like that her reaction you say oh well it's not what you say is how you say it that's uh abusive tactics that's tone policing at its very baseline uh definition that is not okay ho chi being the nice woman that she is decides to do like a field day of you know exercises jen is complaining because like i said jen uh has um what is it called stockholm syndrome she likes being abused by evelyn and shawnee so she wants to go back over to a team colorism and the best way to do that is for her to commiserate with shawnee and evelyn about how bad og is and so this is how jin is laying the foundation to go over to team colorism og has bad energy oh g is mean oh g cooked me breakfast but she didn't feed it to me like jennifer is the most pathetic woman on this show and that's saying a lot when there's a woman named february on here plus the sisters plus shawnee and liza and evelyn ogie as she's cooking breakfast you know decides to uh you know basically use a nicer softer tone telling the sisters look look it's not your job to bridge this divide and they're like oh i like your attitude better today but then they're still doing a confessional and it's like again og is seen as the villain because she checked them in the moment to their faces see so many people are so used to being fake and phony that when you have a real one like og they think that she's the fake and phony one because they're used to being fake and phony shawnee and uh evelyn decides who facetime february because february for whatever reason is still a part of the cast and uh shawnee and evelyn tell her you know their jackie came over with two new guests and one of them is named maya and then february is like oh yeah you know she used to send me porn videos asking is this me and she was stalking me congratulations you gave lance uh fellatio half of america did it and shawnee is so stupid she was like i didn't and i'm like yeah it reminds me of the real housewives of atlanta the season where uh i can't remember her name demetria mckinney was one i think and it was like oh i slept with roger bob i slept with roger bob i was with roger bob that's what we're getting the foundations of with february still being in quarantine and so i think that's the reason that the sisters were invited because she's she's gonna have some peace with february and what i don't really get is how february is allowed to not only be colorist but ages and no one says anything she's like how does jackie know these girls you don't hang out with somebody your grandmother's age uh isn't that literally what uh february evelyn and shawnee are doing like shawnee is old enough to be february's mother evelyn is old enough to be february's mother but jackie is a grandmother to you know nayyah and maria how does that work and so it reminds me of the people like throwing shade not realizing that that shade can actually you know boomerang back onto them the second to the last scene was like i said og was bringing breakfast to the sisters they had their own little uh contemporaneous outside confessional uh soliloquy with each other saying now i'm seeing how og is the problem it's like again i repeat og shared something with you you then took that to the op and og is the problem and this is why again i'm gonna repeat in this video until the cows come home people on twitter are unreliable narrators oh she is not the problem for checking you you're the problem for running your mouth you didn't know og from a can of paint or you know a hole in the wall and you all you know is you she had issues and you go and meet the women she has issues with and the first thing you do is tell what she told y'all like you can't be so thirsty for a 2500 reality tv check that you are moving funny in the light because at the end of the day og is not wrong about this just because people want her to be wrong she's not and people have a long memory and sooner or later the tables will turn and people will be like damn those sisters were kind of foul just like last season people tried to be like why did og jump in it og was being a good friend to cece if you see some wild crazy unhinged woman running up behind me you better toss her ass in the bushes if you're my friend what don't y'all get about that if you see some tall aggressive unhinged dude running up at me you better swing on his ass before i do and then i have to swing on both of y'all if we're friends you do not let your friend get injured and that's what they don't like about og because this new crop of people will set their friends up their mothers up they have no decorum no clues no education no code of ethics and that's why oh she rubs a lot of people the wrong way because her code of ethics are unimpeachable and people don't understand that jennifer still has a problem with og for whatever reason and um i was about to say february february's nemesis naya is basically like well there's an elephant in the room with me in february and lance and og basically says oh you're not ready to talk about it you're sweeping it under the rug which we know means that there was a whole lot left out and then they got mad about that like oh she wants you know she has different rules for herself and it's like no she basically called a thing the thing she called a check made a checkmate and what i don't understand and like i've told people because i've been in positions where i've had adversarial stances with multiple people just because you're fighting with 12 people doesn't mean you're wrong like just because you're the common denominator doesn't mean you're the problem if i have an issue with every single one of my professors and it turns out my professors were white supremacists is it my fault that i challenged them and even though my professors weren't white supremacists that's just the example that came up uh at the top of my head but you understand what i'm saying like too many times people reduce things to its most baseline deductive reasoning and deductive reasoning doesn't always uh flow just because you get into so if you get into a fight with somebody and then you get into five more fights you're the common denominator but what happens if you realize that the six people you fought were all brothers then that changes things right and so og has a right to stand her ground and not you know leave her corner she is not a ship out to win dc she said that there's colorism and i frankly what she would say there was xenophobia but i really feel like if she says that there's xenophobia people will latch onto that and be like who does this african woman think she is and so you know she checked the sisters to their face contemporaneously which means in the moment and then they had to you know run into a confessional behind her back saying oh well now we see og is the problem well why didn't you say that to her face i don't understand and then kristen and malaysia go over to og and they just sort of gasp like her og starts she gets up she cries because og really thought that she was gonna have a fun two weeks you know at a mansion she didn't think that they were going to re-litigate the past and you know unfortunately i think that is og's biggest mistake she made not only shawnee but she made vh1 and um uh viacom looked like they were engaging in anti-black xenophobic colorless racist behavior and they were going to make her pay for that and you can see that now that that's exactly what they're trying to do and frankly i sort of wish og wouldn't have come back to the show because people on twitter are stupid the people who are watching the show five times out of ten are only going to be on evelyn's and shawnee side because they are used to that low brow uncouth behavior and then you have people like me who i'm pretty sure i'm going to lose some people uh because of this review but i do not care i'm standing in the same square oh gee is standing on saying this is a problem you

good things some going here too I actually think that I play worse if I listened to him die them do I need more right now there's a lot of good items Mjolnir is probably the best against PLM KB is the

not to be your first comment yeah don't make ever make a video again please just don't ok on by", "2YwgALTLBkk": "how do you feel Deanie being a family man that's been a digital nomad and raising your kids as you travel you know what need have you felt needing the most yeah I I grew up in a very nice Alien Swarm family where my father worked when my mother was always there for us because that was still possible and these times and then because of you know the inflationary aspect of fiat currency there we grew in the system we're now parents both need to work to provide for their children and so I still know how it felt to be around my family my parents they didn't lock me anywhere I need to care of me you know when I came home from school my mother was there there was food to take everything and I always loved that part of life so when I figured out that I was becoming this workaholic and was just you know accumulating wealth and my wife even was working and we didn't spend that much time with the kids I wish it that was for us this you notice this switch we needed to turn back into becoming a normal family taking care of your kids and now I've been trapped into four years with my family and you know if I'm with him like 24/7 and I would never turn this back because this is exactly why I took my kids I made kicks kids not just because I love sex but also because I want to you know educate my children and teach them and show them the world and show them an elephant and show them the sea and snorkel and all of these things I didn't take these kids to drop them off at childcare at nine weeks old or something you know this is not my goal this is not my vision of raising children in this beautiful world so for me this life changed we made as a it's just amazing and I need to be honest it's not an easy change we really were a very materialistic family spoiling on kids till they were like ten years old so even the oldest one needed to change back from a kid that had their own quad their own bikes their own everything you know to a kid that now was giving this away selling this to give this to poor kid children and to know hang around your parents 24/7 it's not always easy but I would never change back to the life you would like we were living because that was no life that was just Joe there was jail time if I compared the data with jail time do you think that you're do you think that your kids would go back to the old way we talked a lot with them about this because we always worry are we doing the right thing you keep worrying and even four years off so you're still like you still crab you know you were yours death either proven the system that you're grew up do and you it's still difficult to get long loose from the system so you're always worried okay am i doing the right thing for my kids and the kids are always like no no no we love this life yes we love to go to back to Holland to see family and friends one two months a year but no this is okay we don't want to go to school because we were forced to learn things didn't care about now we can learn things we really care about and you are there to support us and this is what they love and then you know the only thing they missed in this life and that's what brings me back again to how the Dow is the social context the offline social context of course they have their virtual online you know worlds where they spent hours a week with their friends from Holland and in then at the stage you know and the old meet each other there has avatars and they chat and do all that stuff you know but they still need to have this social environment where they can connect with same aged kids where my oldest daughter is 14 I cannot say her first kiss you already had a kiss but she can kiss a guy you know and she can go on a date with a guy and my second daughter is well you know they need these social things this this also social that's called experiments physically you cannot grow up in a very safe environment of only your father and mother because then you're not growing up in a real life because you need to face some trouble as well so that is why I believe this community could provide this environment where they can also have these experiences I had as a as a kid so if that is my answer you know it's it's it's not always easy but they they slowly grow into this digital nomad life and then you can see their mind being way more adult than the kids of their age so they like you if you prepare this in this family dinner my oldest daughter is like okay I'm coming I'm going to help eh I'm just helping with groceries no one cares a 14 they don't do that at this point like here they are just there on the hand a step telling and making fakie and survivor comes with 12 other kids and you know all these kids things and so I can really yeah I can really feel that my kids are slowly growing into it but also miss a little bit of the physical social environment you know to go out especially now let me hold his laughter's 14 she's driving the bike here and on the whole violin you know this is beautiful and ha you need to be 16 even then you need to get a driving license now she's 14 she was driving the bike she do God does groceries she does everything she wants and she has this this freedom feeling like whoa I'm not a baby anymore you know all other Western societies they pamper do you see it like this pamper their people you know the unique treat like little babies yeah whoo there is a flu stay inside you know all these things they push on you this pressure and also the pressure on the parents to treat your kids in that way even if you don't want to that is completely different way or digital no no family no pressure no rules no nothing you just do it the way you like it yeah it's interesting because I know statistically it said that we become the average of the five people who spend the most time with and that's really scary I think in light of what we're seeing right now you talked about you touched on kovat and you see people not knowing to stand up for themselves not knowing that they can maybe question these orders not knowing that maybe they can use their own judgment and the reason this is is because they spent you know like you're saying to John Lennon's point you know it takes four years giving you four years with a child and I'll embed us see that you know they'll never be able to break out it now imagine what twelve years of traditional schooling does to someone you know and it's because they prepare they prepare the jamaat's public for them going into these factory like behavior type jobs you know what you do what you're told and you don't question and it's really scary you know and I would say that here at house Dow that's we're using the same science of programming but in the opposite way programming to create individuals that are independent that have ideas for projects and are in an environment where this can become actualized realize so that that that there was a little shocker for me but so if you turn into the five people that you're surrounded with I am slowly turning into a woman because I like for three daughters and the wife wait I need to check that's still there it's still there still another maybe boy yet important to spend time with people that you feel that they are in line with your vision of life and one could argue that it's the monetary system the inflated monetary system that then makes it extremely difficult for families to be there for their families that they created because they have to work harder as money's worth less you know so much how much how you see a nature and this is just a general role across all all nature is that things that unfold from the inside out you know a seed becomes a tree you know ideas become reality you know a child is grown from the inside out you know so I think in the same way that the economic situation in the world as a whole and our society's fragmentation fragmentation is a result of our monetary system that's inflated that's broken you know it's corrupt in the same way or in the opposite way rather you know what we're building here at house adele is based on Bitcoin that's our seed that's our foundation you know that's deflationary by nature it's only gonna go up in value it's decentralized you know it's censorship resistant it's it's the exact same but in the opposite direction so I think that's so powerful and it says so much for what we're building yeah somewhere along the line we just lost sight of the fact that you know if you just look at right if you look at the baby and baby you know it's born and then it it teaches itself everything it teaches itself how to crawl it eats itself how to walk if we can guide them a little bit and help them in a bit a little bit but they develop themselves so where summer and the point we just invented the system where we need to take over what this beautiful wonder needs to know at a certain age this is read at a certain age needs to calculate at a certain age need to have a certain level of knowledge why just to become part of a system that is you know needs to run to become oil for this huge business called the Dutch government of the Dutch and V or BV whatever you call it so I think it's like I can see it the youngest one has never gone to school she's a bright girl she had taught herself to read to write she's not as fast as other kids of her age but she knows other things very fast she is very fast if you if she she reads people because she has traveled she has been around with different kinds of people so I think at the end what does it matter if the kid can read when she is 20 or five because when she will start to work really work she will be 2000 people will like graduate from school around their age and if they have the same level of knowledge at that age that is the goal the path to the goal doesn't matter it where she leads where she starts to learn something it's just that the goal is that she needs to learn how to read or whatever even if that is still a goal you know because if you look into the future into ten years times now even closer than two five-year signs have been telling this know long but I still have this 10 years life and five years time I don't need to educate myself in languages anymore I have this Eve earpiece that is wireless and I just speak Dutch and this Japanese guys has the same earpiece and he understands Japanese and he speaks Japanese and Google Translate will be translated in my ear into touch and we can have this conversation without even ever learning to speak a language my daughter is not learning to calculate it anymore because she's like she learns the basics but still she's now like yeah if it's too difficult that he's like Siri 1,250,000 times 7/4 two seconds in you at the end we are living in an age of no we are living in an age of information information you can grab the information in a second from all of the internet why would you need to repeat all these things by learning it like at the top of your head if it's already there yeah that's such an interesting point because it's also said that there's a saying I don't know who said it it sounds like if the quality of your life is determined by the quality of your questions and if you think about creators much like yourself you created master ventures creative several other companies different projects now and anyone in the space that's an innovator what makes them different is their ability to ask good questions and then follow that question with another question until they get the answers you know what does it matter like to your point if you have all this information you've memorized all this information but what are you gonna do with it right so for your daughter it's only gonna matter what she learns and as much as it's in line with what she wants to do with her life that's all that's really gonna matter it's not gonna matter if she learns all the science all this math and look for what she ends up becoming an artist you know like everything that we learned is only as important as it's relevant to what we're doing so I think you know and then it also makes me think about I was reading somewhere about how the schools of the elite they have a totally different paradigm they don't they prize leadership they prize and they were more kids for asking you know challenging questions you know for they they have a totally different paradigm you know problem solving creating and so I think it'd be interesting to incorporate a lot of that into the schools that we booked because that's also part of Casa del you know like to your point we're trying to raise communities so part of that is gonna be the school system that we design you know and have people have people have an opinion because that's what the traditional school system is doing it's creating opinion and like I always used as an example in Holland there is this test and all the kids need to do at the end of the year and then one question in this test was if you see an igloo like built from ice what color fits to the Eagle is it blue or is it red so the word kids mm red and then this answer was not correct like because it's not red it's blue they do this coat then this kid responded by cold is red because people who sit in the middle to heaven one tequila provides warmth for the people so why is my answer wrong so this free thinking this is what we need to provide children why is something blue why can they be red because it's providing heat for the people that want to live in it so this is the the hole in it this is one example of the whole education system that is completely wrong it's just forcing people to believe something it's the same way that I would force my youngest daughter friend from the day she was born and if I show her a banana they would tell her this is an apple and I will keep telling her from the day she's born doesn't have the whole world can tell her no that's banana she says she will always believe with appearances for them she always says nah man this is an apple my daddy said that's true you know and this is what you need to do like as parents it'll take control of the knowledge of your kids because that is knowledge you want to find them because you believe in something so in the news a few days ago JK Rowling asked in Twitter she has the crypto community community in general I think you know what is Bitcoin and everyone jumped in trying to help her understand they were using her novel and the characters and you know everything to try to explain this to her and they failed miserably Elon Musk jumped in and he said it's magic Internet money she responds with Bitcoin is you know all I understand is like Bitcoin is blah blah blah blah she said and I think that's so sad and really speaks to the social responsibility I think everyone in the crypto space has to the rest of the world because everyone who's in crypto right now we're comparable to the founding fathers but like every other major movement or nation you know we are laying the groundwork and I believe that we could have done better you know how I don't know and that's my question to you is how would you have answered how would you have addressed a question you know what is Bitcoin where do you start I answered the tweet with with a tick-tock for you my daughter made she she made this tick-tock for you of her being three people one sitting in the chair looking at Angel and looking at a devil and they were both explaining what bitcoin is in a very simple way so this is how I answer to JK you're my daughter and I will try to explain it to you in a very simple way no bitcoin is a peer-to-peer there's no cash that will include the excluded into the new monetary system people can set to each other without a bank accounts it's going to change the world flow that's cool bitcoin is decentralized which means nobody controls okay it's 24/7 usable and borderless which means you'll be using 24 hours a day seven days a week all over the world that's really awesome it's also uncomfortable which means nobody can take it from you yeah that's important and it's a mute which means nobody can change or hack it whoa that's really cool thanks voices in my head straight to the moon because that video is about two minutes yeah it's really nice video it's a she did her best in creating and that's also you know she's she's 12 and she created this beautiful thing and she loves to make these big bucks which is a very creative way of using the telephone instead of just watching Netflix and at the same time I answered a tweet where as well like the more there is another author a huge are the best allows or Robert Kiyosaki I think is his name and he wrote poor man rich that and he's a huge bitcoin believer so I said man check and just text your friend and ask him and yeah and now also to my mind comes this guy we met together Amazon sports yeah I think he's the founder this huge Bitcoin or this record this huge Harry Potter fan site and I think even visited JK at her home to just to write one chapter of the book so JK just call Emerson and you still have his number and ask him because he's also truly even a Bitcoin an investment Bitcoin so ya know Emerson Emerson stay with us at house of Dow and yeah no sir Emerson sports a means he's really not human he's a supercomputer in a human's body but a credibly charming and like he's what I'm one of his biggest fans I guess and and so Emerson when he was 12 years old but to Harry Potter books in one night I don't know how it's possible I think it would take me at least a year to read one property and and so when he was 12 years old he there was a competition who had the world's best Harry Potter site and an emerson created a really shitty site and but figured out you know how to hack the system essentially by lock me out bogging in and you can vote for yourself every time you log out log in and log out okay a lot kind like it so I did it like for two days or something just long hop all day long and then he was at number one and and then he got to number one he realized well I definitely don't have the world's best Harry Potter site its just a piece of so he really just focused on how do I make the world's best website now and so he learned how to do that real quickly and then within a short amount of time actually built an incredible Harry Potter site and then very shortly after that sold it for 12 years old I think it was something like a hundred million dollars or something that wasn't even selling the whole psyche it was just a an ownership I don't know for the majority or minority but it was it was a really significant I mean and what a cool huh and that this is just and emerson was a middle school dropout by the way and you know has gone on to you know being he's like Forbes 30 under 30 he is the you know the the Forbes calls in the king of morality he's gone on to build something like thirty other thirty other viral websites that all have millions of unique visitors every month and this is just a testament to the fact that you really don't need school and he was one of the people who really you know I mean I already knew this but you know it just his story is so so inspiring you know he just learned the things that he wanted to learn and I mean granted the kid has a brain unlike anyone else I've ever met but it but it goes but there's plenty of stories of people out there who you know who felt that school was slowing them down and created their own way to success you know and yeah some person was incredibly inspiring yeah I need to admit the beautiful part of the Emerson story was that was in the house of Dow like into an 1818 wood and then his whole family was there so his brothers but also his parents and Tom and Maggie's far as I think it was and his aunt Betsy yeah and this was like I get boot goosebump the goosebumps why because I got time to spend time with Tom and Meggie to parents that already raised all the gifts in a freeway without educational without school education so I had a lot of question of course and it was an amazing time Tom I'm like I'm still I'm still no I have your invitation to come and visit you guys I will when I set foot in States in your beautiful house yeah yeah they're they're amazing parents the whole family is incredible yeah them as soon as there's two brothers and they you know traveling the world and and you know I know that when when they're ready to disrupt something it's going to be full power yeah full power Emerson drew Dillon then yeah then yeah cool guys see you guys bring up a really interesting point it's me you know you know what it's right you know what I used to do like you know how people have those bracelets like WWJD what would Jesus do yeah I used to think I used to think of self what would Emerson do what a situation like whatever to do okay that we saw so many conversation at the table I was like there was another dude there was also like very Chavez the other guy was like a like a small robot and if they started to come in and he wouldn't like like like it was like two two dictionaries talking to each other and hi Nevel I mean I was just laughing and eating official intelligent robot do you think the chances no the chance is do you think if I calculate no you cannot call me ever since thing is reading reading one book a day and he does it every single day and so it's time to do incredible amounts of other things which is mind-blowing but if you want to know a little bit about what Emerson's mine is like something I always recommend to people it's incredibly inspiring incredibly it's one of the most moving documentaries for me ever is is called the Internet's own boy the story of Aaron Swartz when I met Emerson within one minute of meeting him the first person I thought about was Aaron Swartz because there'd have incredible incredibly similar stories and they had incredibly similar brains glamour and then when I met Emerson I said I said like within five minutes meeting of it I pulled him aside that men do you know who the Aaron Swartz was and he goes yeah mm-hmm I'm like man you're risking that story then sure that's one boy because mm-hmm just kind of smiles at me and then I go to do you remind me so much of Aaron he doesn't I know right like I always thought of myself as like the slightly less weird and like socially awkward Aaron you know and but why I'm such a big fan of air Emerson if you watch that documentary the Internet's own boy you'll see what an amazingly talented incredibly gifted person Aaron Swartz was and how he had the power to move the internet and move masses he was just knew how to do that and you know we lost him due to the year us political and justice system that was incredibly unjust and you know and there was an incredibly sad story but then release inspiring and it was actually one of the most moving stories for me to do what I what I want to do you know leave America get out of that ridiculous system and you know ultimately conquer it's in the way that we're doing it you know so this is something I recommend to everybody to watch yeah we'll put the link in the description below so you you both make me think about something I heard Mike Novogratz once a which is that mass adoption will happen once once we master storytelling for Bitcoin for its use case in the real world and it's interesting because now that JK Rowling jumped in you know with her question and she stirred the water basically even though it was not done right or in the most you know best way nevertheless she stirred the water and how you said didi you know you and your response to her you know you asked her to go reach out to her off their friend robert kiyosaki because we all like because we're the average of the five people we spend the most time with we listen to people like us right there's so many studies on this so and because mass adoption yes it needs to happen on the top to your levels you know with our older generations in use and ease of use the way you're talking about you know it's like things people who don't care about the fundamentals of Bitcoin have to be able to grab the apps or the damps have to be able to use crypto currencies and not care about how this vehicles driven right they just need to be able to use it easily so I would say that approach is for the the primarily more the older generations because they're kind of not too tech savvy but for the younger generations which is like the biggest opportunity to create to program for the lack of a better word maybe that is the right word to program them and leaving in the power of the Bitcoin and how it can be used and and maybe make an example of someone like the Internet's own boy or like someone like Emerson sparks you know that's didn't girl up and wasn't educated in a traditional school system you know but is this shining example of what a human being can become like if they have parents that support the unschooling that support following your passion you know I think it could be quite amazing if a novel like Harry Potter something super engaging if there's characters and it's interesting you know to Mike Novogratz point it's you have just story tell it in a way that engages everyone and tell us the big picture but also within it there's use case scenarios there's the bad guys know the government's you know and then there's the the opposition that rises up and this is their solution but it's peaceful like Gandhi you know be the solution don't fight but use peaceful methods which is provide an alternative so I think it could be so interesting if someone JK Rowling or to write a novel that explained Bitcoin in a way that would just in one sweep educate everyone you know all I can think about when you say Mike novigrad says have you seen this video mean thing where like Meester know that said like it was like like something and the second is like it's his head spinning around as it VidCon please gold dome or stop goin sideways out on if I say we goin down to one gay but mr. Novik let's say we have [Music] [Music] [Music] no agree it would be amazing if we get an order I had a Harry Potter book where Harry Potter is hollering it's a magical when now with Bitcoin and stuff like that you know there is a Bitcoin book I think the book is called Bitcoin money and it's already translated in more than 20 languages and it's to educate children about Bitcoin that's a beautiful book it's also translated in Dutch and Jeremy the children and grandparents I would say yeah probably children grandpa yes but it's a it's a nice book I can yeah maybe we can add the link to it and they'd be nice if they bought some pizza with it I mean hey it's two days away from Bitcoin pizza day yeah is it two days yeah yeah we're gonna have we're gonna have toasted our family pizza 90 tonight yeah yeah Carl crystal paper it's okay we volunteer there we'll get some peanuts with M&Ms and we will take the pizza to the moon on that note it's getting a bit late coming up borrowing buried in their time so we'll wrap it up and we'll carry on I think a later time I think there's so much to be said but thank you both so much and you're being passionate in the space and wanting to bring about the change and being that example you're very welcome can you leave us with a basic instinct move [Laughter]", "Bs-Zg9vhN14": "finally got an alignment what's up guys see us welcome next year sorry about breaking the news so late um i was over at uw taking photos with my family and obviously family first but anyway the seahawks um traded for um offensive guard gabe jackson so that's good finally improving that o-line because obviously we got to keep russell here man and then next we um got tight and gerald everett who is from our division rival la rams and obviously i've seen we've seen we play we play the rams twice a year and every time you see them and we play against them you all you'll always see gerald everett um make some clutch plays i mean yeah i get it he was probably behind tyler higby most of the time but whenever he did have the chance to step up he really did so it's nice to see a replacement for greg olson and hopefully a better addition than greg wilson as last year greg wilson didn't do that much and daryl everett it just gives me that wide receiver vibe so that's really good because obviously we um i would love to have like a quick tight end quick powerful you know that kind of thing the all around titan that i would love to see that as for gabe jackson it's about darn time we got an old um offensive lineman in the in free agency um obviously a guards um very important position damien luz already has the other side the right guard so i'm expecting gabe jackson to probably play left guard um as mikey potty did retire um earlier this year so that's a big plus to our awareness i feel like gabe jackson is better than mikey potty and so i feel like the only part we gotta really fix is center and right tackle and i think hold on we'll be fine right tackle not really but we'll think about that later but for now yep gabe jackson and gerald everett welcome to the hawks and yep i'm out go hawks", "CaryjOdYFa0": "[Music] what's

Click CC at bottom right to turn off. Sometimes it feels like DNA gets all the credit. Yes, the structure DNA is amazing. It has a beautiful double helix structure! A twisted ladder! It has its own emoji! DNA stores genetic information and codes for\nyour traits. However, sometimes what gets left out is how\nimportant RNA is. Without RNA, you actually couldn\u2019t get that\ngenetic message out to your cells so that they can start producing proteins. We talk about this in protein synthesis. RNA is a very important biomolecule \u2013 just\nas important as DNA. In fact, RNA is even hypothesized as coming\nfirst before DNA in the RNA World hypothesis---something we need to make a separate video about. So let\u2019s compare and contrast DNA with RNA. First you will find DNA and RNA in all living\norganisms. In eukaryotic cells, DNA tends to be found\nin the nucleus while you can find RNA both in and out of the nucleus. Prokaryotic cells don\u2019t have a nucleus. Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, which\nare a type of biomolecule. Nucleic acids have a monomer---which if you\nremember from our biomolecules video, a monomer is a building block. The monomer for nucleic acids is a nucleotide\nso both DNA and RNA have nucleotides. The nucleotides of both RNA and DNA have three\nparts: a phosphate, sugar, and a base. Let\u2019s draw 6 nucleotides of DNA and 6 nucleotides\nof RNA. DNA is generally double stranded, and if focusing\non these two strands of nucleotides here, you can see they run antiparallel to each\nother. RNA is generally single-stranded so you are\njust seeing one strand here. The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose and the sugar\nin RNA is ribose. This makes sense because DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic\nacid. That\u2019s helpful to know because the \u201cdeoxyribose\u201d\nis a sugar, and \u201cnucleic acid\u201d is that type of biomolecule it is. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid as its sugar\nis ribose. The bases in DNA are adenine, thymine, guanine,\nand cytosine. It helps to remember the popular mnemonic\ndevice: apples in the tree (that helps you remember that A goes with T) and car in the\ngarage (so C goes with G) to understand how DNA bases pair. The bases in RNA are adenine, uracil, guanine,\nand cytosine. Notice the different one? It\u2019s uracil! So you have to change that popular mnemonic\ndevice here\u2026instead of apples in the tree\u2026maybe the apples are\u2026under? Car in the garage still works. We mentioned earlier that DNA codes for your\ntraits, but it couldn\u2019t do that without RNA\u2019s help. In our protein synthesis video, we talk about\nthree different types of RNA and their very important roles. mRNA, which stands for messenger RNA. mRNA\u2019s\njob is to carry a message based off of the DNA. In eukaryotic cells, DNA generally stays in\nthe nucleus but mRNA has the ability to leave the nucleus to take this message to a ribosome. Ribosomes make protein and RNA is actually\na major component of ribosomes. This type of RNA is called rRNA, which stands\nfor ribosomal RNA. Finally, we discuss transfer RNA or abbreviated\ntRNA. Its job is to transfer amino acids to match\nthe correct mRNA codon. Codon charts using mRNA codons have been developed\nso that you can actually see which amino acid is brought for each mRNA codon. When those amino acids are joined together,\nthey make a polypeptide chain. Proteins are made of one or more of these\npolypeptide chains, and proteins have tons of different roles. But we don\u2019t want to spoil it---check out\nmore in our protein synthesis video. Before we go, let\u2019s try a little 3 question\nquiz shall we? Just pause it after the question so you have\ntime to think about it! Question 1) If I have 8 DNA nucleotides, how\nmany DNA bases do I have? How many base pairs? The answer: Each nucleotide---regardless of\nwhether it\u2019s a DNA or RNA nucleotide--- has a phosphate, sugar, and a base. So 8 DNA nucleotides would have 8 bases. DNA bases pair like this- and that\u2019s 4 DNA\nbase pairs. Question 2) If one strand of DNA has these\nbases shown here--- A, T, T, G, A, C--- can you complete what the complementary DNA bases\nwould be for the other DNA strand? The answer: So remember those base pairing\nrules for DNA and the popular mnemonic. If placing the bases in this image, reading\nin the direction shown on this image, they\u2019d be T, A, A, C, T, G. Question 3) In a process known as transcription,\na complementary RNA strand called messenger RNA has to complement the DNA. More about that in our protein synthesis video. So if I still had that original portion of\nDNA here, what would the complementary RNA bases here be? The answer: So remember it\u2019s asking for\nRNA. No thymine here; it\u2019s uracil instead. Apples under helps you remember A with U. Car in the garage helps you remember C with\nG. So in this portion, reading in the direction\nshown on this image, we\u2019d have these RNA bases. Notice the answer is similar to the last answer,\nbut there are uracil bases here instead of thymine. One last thing. Our models here--- they\u2019re unable to show\nthe beautiful 3D shape, the exact number of bases per turn, the chirality---but we\u2019ve\nleft you some links to explore because the goal of our videos is always to introduce\ntopics so you can discover all the fascinating details and exceptions. Check out our further reading description\nto keep that curiosity going. Well, that\u2019s it for the Amoeba Sisters and\nwe remind you to stay curious.", "FBGprgoGc8k": "Hi, everyone. Aaron here for Zollotech and the iPhone\nse second generation and the iPhone 12 mini are both the smallest phones offered\nfrom Apple in either the Apple store or apple.com. And so I wanted to help you decide\nwhich one would be best for you. And so we're going to cover everything\nfrom the price to the storage, to the speed and the cameras and\nmore. So the first thing is the price. The iPhone se starts\nat $399 and goes up to $549. The iPhone 12 mini starts at\na much more expensive $699. And it goes up to $849. However, if you want the iPhone\n12 mini carrier unlocked, meaning you can use any SIM\ncard to use it around the world. You'll have to pay an additional $30\nunless you get it directly through a carrier. So that's something that's a little bit\nnew this year on the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 mini, both of them are offered in the same\nstorage options of 64 gigabytes, 128 gigabytes or 256 gigabyte options. They also have a little bit\ndifferent color offerings. The iPhone se only gets three\ndifferent colors, black white, and this product red where the iPhone\n12 mini comes in quite a few different colors, black that I have\nhere, white, red, green, and blue. The blue is\nthe new color this year. Now both are made out of aluminum. They have an aluminum frame or on the\noutside edge and they have glass front and back. But the iPhone S E is sort of the older\nstyle where it has the rounded edges and the buttons are a little bit\ndifferent. So what I mean by that, as you can see here, the iPhone 12 mini is more\nsquared off and has a much larger, more pronounced power button. And then\nbelow the power button on the iPhone, SE is the SIM card tray, but below\nthe power button on the iPhone, 12 mini is the 5g millimeter wave antenna. That's specific to the United States. We don't really have a standard for\nmillimeter wave too much around the world right now. So it's only in the\nUnited States and mostly on Verizon, somewhat on a T and T. Now\non the top of the phones, they're exactly the same on the\nleft-hand side of the phone, you'll have your silent switch\nand your volume buttons, but below that on the iPhone,\n12 mini is the SIM card tray. We don't have anything else on\nthe iPhone S E on the bottom. They're also a little bit different this\nyear. So I'm the bottom of the phones. You can see that we\nhave lightning on both, but we have symmetrical speaker\nand microphone holes on the iPhone. S E whereas on the iPhone\n12 mini they're asymmetric, meaning the microphone has two holes and\nthere's four holes for the speakers on the iPhone, 12 mini. So it's something\na little bit different there. Everything else is basically the same. Now the weight is also a\nlittle bit different as well. The iPhone 12 is a little bit smaller\nthan the iPhone se coming in at 4.7, six ounces or 135 grams\nversus the iPhone SE at 5.2, two ounces, or 148 grams. You can see there is a slight size\ndifference with the iPhone 12 mini being a little bit shorter. And if\nI put them side by side, you can see that it's also\na little bit narrower. The iPhone 12 mini is narrower. It\nseems to be about the same thickness, but it's also narrower and shorter\nbased off the overall dimensions. So fitness-wise, they're very similar,\nbut with the squared off edges, the mini is easier to hang on to and\nless slippery, at least in my opinion. And like I said, they're\nboth glass front and back, and they're both fingerprint magnets. This is just fingerprints from\nfilming the video already. And the iPhone 12 mini has\nthe new ceramic shield, which makes it four times less likely\nto break in the event that you drop your phone. Now, if you're not\nusing a case, of course, it's still four times less likely, but it still should be a little\nbit more durable that way. Scratch resistance\nshould be about the same. There's really not a difference there\nwhatsoever. Now, as you can see, we have touch ID and face\nID. Both are very subjective. Meaning if you really like touch ID,\nthat's going to be better for you. Face ID works well, too.\nThey're both very secure. Technically face ID is more secure\nunless you have a twin for example, but they're both equally fast and it's\nreally just comes down to preference as far as what you like\nthere. Now, of course, another huge difference is the\ndisplays, the display on the se, despite it having larger bezels and the\nphone being larger overall is actually smaller at 4.7 inches.\nAnd it's an LCD display. It's 1334 by 750 pixels with a density of 326 pixels per inch. The iPhone 12 mini actually uses an\nOla display or a super retina XDR display. That's capable of HDR\nwhere the iPhone se is not. It's a 5.4 inch display\nwith 2340 by 10 80 pixels or 476 pixels per inch. So it's a much more pixel dense display, both look great and go to the\nsame 625 nits of brightness. They're plenty bright, but\nwhen playing HDR content, the iPhone 12 mini can go all the\nway up to 1200 nits of brightness. So it is technically a little\nbit brighter, but in normal use, you won't see a difference.\nBoth have great viewing angles, both are phenomenal displays, but the iPhone 12 mini being that\nit's OLED has PWM or pulse with modulation to control brightness. That means it's flickering\nthe display faster or slower, depending on how much the brightness\nis set to the top or bottom. So meaning if the super bright\nit's going to flash faster. Now this is something you\ncan't see with your eyes, but can cause some people\nto feel nauseated or create\nheadaches for that person. And in the newer phones\nwith the iPhone 12 series, it doesn't seem to be a problem for me, but if you are sensitive to those things, you'll want to go with the iPhone se or\nan LCD display because it is always on, it's not flickering at all. So that may\nbe a consideration for some, of course, with the display, with the iPhone 12 mini,\neven though it's a little bit bigger, you do have the notch that may\nbother some people personally, it's never bothered me, but if it's\nsomething that bothers you again, you could go with the se.\nNow, when it comes to specs, both are very fast phones. They\nboth have great processors in them. The iPhone se second gen has the\nA13 bionic with three gigabytes of Ram where the iPhone 12 mini has the\nA14 bionic with four gigabytes of Ram. Now that extra Ram helps with the display, but also helps with the newer\nprocessor. So both are phenomenal, both are really fast. So let's go\nahead and open up the phone here. And if we open certain apps like music, they're going to load basically\nthe same. So if we go into music, it's the first time I've opened it\non the 12. You'll see it was fast. If I opened weather, for example, it\ntakes a moment to load and refresh. Both are equally fast. That way,\nif I open a game like Minecraft, we'll run it here on both.\nWe'll wait for it to load. We'll get to the main loading screen\nhere. And if we hit play on both, then we create an create\nnew world, create new world. And then we hit create at the same time, we'll let it process and load the world. Both we'll play it just as fast\nwe'll hit, proceed on both. And they should both load about the same. Sometimes you get surprised and\nthe older phone will load faster. So they're very similar, but you'll\nsee now it's building the world. It says, generating\nworld. We'll wait for it. And you can see in real\ntime how long it takes. Now, this is the first time opening this\napp. So this should give you an idea. This isn't really a general overall\ntest of how fast it is per se, but it gives you an idea of what's\ngoing on. And it is taking a while. [Inaudible]. And like I said, the older phone or the iPhone se is\nactually a little bit faster this time. So it's kind of strange that\nit's doing that, but there we go. It took a moment that could be\ninternet. It could be other things, but both should be equally fast. Sometimes that can just be\nthe processor ramping up. And it was opened for the first\ntime on the iPhone, 12 mini, but both will play it\njust fine either way. You'll have smooth frame rates on either, but that's kind of an interesting result. And I do see that from time to time\nnow, other than games like Minecraft, you have among us or call of duty. And if we just go into\nfree play here and there we go, free play select. And of\ncourse, we're in very quickly, it's going to be fast on just\nabout anything. Of course, there shouldn't be an issue there.\nI'll just close that for now, but anything from call of duty\nto Minecraft should be fine. So no issues with playing\nany of the most recent games, you can use an Xbox controller.\nYou could use a PS4 controller. It really doesn't matter, but\ndoing something really intensive, such as exporting 4k video should show\nus the true power of either processor. Now, it's really hard to show you the actual\npower of the processor with the neural engine, but exporting a 4k video is\npretty intensive. So let's try that. Now I've opened, I'm moving closed\nall other apps and created a movie. So you see, I movie is\nthe only thing running. I've imported the same clip into\nboth recorded from an iPhone. And then what I'll do is\nI'll just add a title here, just a simple one that says Zillow tech, that way it has to do a\nlittle bit extra work. There we go. And again, we'll do the same\non the other phone here, the same exact title. Okay. And it's a little bit difficult for\nme to type on the small keyboard, but you get the idea. It has a\ntitle there's me in the video. So we'll set it to the beginning\nof both. We'll hit done, and then we'll share slide these over. And then I'll bring in my iPhone 12 pro\nmax is a stopwatch here and we'll go save video. Start. And let's see what it does. So this is\ngoing to save it and export it in 4k. Let's see if there's a difference between\nthe two of them both have the clip downloaded and it's moving\nalong pretty quickly on both. So if you've ever exported video, you know that the iPhones\nare very fast at doing this. They're both almost done. And you'll see that the iPhone 12\nmini finished maybe two seconds before the iPhone se. So it's really not that\nbig of a difference between\nboth of them and after doing an intensive task like that,\nthey're not very warm on the back. There is a little bit of heat on the\nside of the iPhone se and the iPhone 12 mini feels basically a little bit\nwarm in the same sort of area. So no real issue there. It's pretty impressive that they\ncan export video that quickly. Now let's talk about the cameras. The forward facing cameras\nof both are very different. So on the iPhone se second generation, it's only a seven megapixel camera with\nan F 2.2 aperture that can record up to 10 80 P on the iPhone mini\nor iPhone 12 mini it's a 12 megapixel true depth camera.\nThat is an F 2.2 aperture, but can record 4k 60 or HDR. So\nthey're very different cameras. And I'll show you some samples in\na moment on the back of the phones. That's where it's very different.\nIn fact, the 12 mini is leaps ahead. When it comes to the camera on the iPhone,\nse you have a singular camera camera, that's actually a 12 megapixel camera\nwith an F 1.8 aperture and can record up to 4k 60, which is actually quite good. I filmed the entire iPhone se review with\nan iPhone se, but the iPhone 12 mini, like I said, is leaps above. You\nget two cameras, both 12 megapixels, but you get an F 1.6 aperture as\nwell as an ultra wide F two points for aperture. Both can record 4k 60,\nbut there's extra features as well, 4k 30 and Dolby vision HDR, as\nwell as some additional features, such portrait modes and\nnight modes as well. So let's first go into our camera\noptions so I can show you the difference there. We'll go down to camera\nhere. There's camera on the iPhone, 12 mini camera on the\niPhone se. And like I said, you have 4k 60 on both, but if you\nscroll down on the iPhone, 12, many, you have HDR. You can record up to 30 frames per\nsecond in 10 bit high dynamic range with Dolby vision, which is really phenomenal. If we go into the cameras themselves\nagain, you have different features. So you have portrait modes on both, but the portrait is a lot\nbetter on the iPhone, 12 mini, and it can recognize objects,\nobjects where it can't on the iPhone. Se you have to recognize a person. You also have slow-mo\ntime-lapse and you have night modes when it's dark as\nwell on the iPhone 12 mini. So let's go ahead and take a look at the\nphoto and video from the forward facing and the rear cameras as well.\nSo you can see the difference The forward facing camera of the\niPhone, S E two, and the iPhone 12 mini. And so you can see how it's handling\nthe background with the sky. And also you can hear the audio from the\niPhone se two and the iPhone 12 mini. Let me know what you think sounds\nbest in the comments below. So hopefully that gives you a good\nidea of what the cameras are like. Now, internally, these are very different\nwhen it comes to the cellular modems, the iPhone se has a 4g Intel\nmodem. That's capable of 4g LTE, where the iPhone 12 mini has a\nQualcomm modem capable of 5g. The Qualcomm modem seems to\nhold onto connections better. Doesn't seem to drop phone calls\nand has faster speeds. Overall. It's just a much better modem in my\nspecific use or anytime I've ever used it. Wifi is about the same though. Now, when it comes to the water resistance\nof both, both are IP certified, but the iPhone se is IP 67\nrated for up to one meter for 30 minutes. The iPhone 12 mini though\nhas a much better rating of\nIP 68 for up to six meters for 30 minutes. So it seems to be a much better sealed\nphone and more resistant to dust and water. Now, when it comes to the battery, you would think with the iPhone se being\nlarger and having a lower resolution display, it would have better battery\nlife, but the battery is actually smaller. It's an 1,820 1 million power\nbattery in the iPhone se which Apple says is good for 13\nhours of video playback. That means just video downloaded and\nplaying that back with the iPhone 12 mini though, you get up to 15 hours of\nvideo playback where the larger 2,227 million power\nbattery. In my general test, when I did a review of both, I got about four hours of\nscreen on time with the iPhone. Se some people may get more, but that's generally what I got four to\nfour and a half hours with the iPhone 12 mini. You get about five\nhours in my general, use five to five and a half hours,\ndepending on how you're using it. So you did get, do get a little bit more. You've got a little bit nicer\ndisplay pushing a lot more pixels. So that's basically the difference there. Now when it comes to charging them though, both don't come with a\ncharger in the box anymore. If you buy an iPhone se there will no\nlonger be a charger. If you buy one new, if you find one used, you\nmay have that charger, but charging using a 20 watt adapter, Apple says you'll get\n50% charge in 30 minutes, and it will take a little bit longer\nafter that both will wirelessly charge, but with the iPhone 12 mini, you\ncan use mag safe accessories, such as the mag safe adapter and\nwirelessly fast charge for up to 15 Watts. So it does help. It's not super fast,\nit's slower than just plugging it in, but you can fast charge and\nyou have this magnetic adapter, which helps align the charger. You also get MagSafe accessories such as\nthis leather case that also has magnets in it to help secure it to the case.\nHold it on a little bit better. Although I don't see much\nof a difference there. I don't think it's the magnet securing\nit as much as the lip on the case, but again, you can use MagSafe\naccessories that are magnetic and hold, hold it to different things such as car\nmounts that you've seen from Belkin. For example, with the iPhone se you can use mag safe\nto center on the back and it will start charging. You can see it's\ncharging now, and it will charge, but you won't get the\nfast charging from it. So you still can wirelessly\ncharge through that, but you can use any cheesy certified\nwireless charger with either of these phones now, which one\nis right for you? Well, that really depends on a\ncouple of different things.\nFirst of all, your budget, the iPhone se second gen is definitely\nless expensive for the same storage options, but you don't have some of the nicer\nthings such as the forward and rear facing cameras or the battery life of the\n12 mini also size is a consideration. The iPhone 12 mini feels more\npremium to me personally, with the squared off edges and\nis much smaller in your hand. So it feels different. It feels more premium and has more\nsimilar to what you would have with say an iPhone five, for example. So it reminds\nme of that quite a bit. However, with the iPhone SE again,\nyou're getting touch ID, which some people would prefer over face\nID. They're both secure, like I said, but they are different. And if you prefer touch ID or you\nprefer LCD displays because the Ola displays bother your eyes. Well\nthen obviously go with the iPhone. S E both are great phones. They're both very capable and\nthey both work really well, but it really just comes down to whatever\nyour personal preference is with the things I've already mentioned. So let me know what you\nchose in the comments below. And I would love to hear which\none you chose, which color, and maybe you decided to stick with\nan older iPhone or pick up something different, like an iPhone, 12 pro\nor 12 pro max, something like that.

the ramp now and the numbers game is real nbk flash for a brief time but he's still able to hold some kind of crossfire although valde is threatening to fall away going back there such as a pistol round reading that the push wasn't quite happening i think he maybe read that they were trying to get him to overrotate towards that ramp or b bombsite and look what he's got by going back and repeating two kills unanswered by mibr now with 45 seconds on the clock valdez so good in that ramp room man if that's mobr's game plan here i'm a bit worried for them he's so reliable in that spot he proves it there and now alexi b with the dollies and mantu with the usp gets caught now there's a chance to go down towards b alexi b will hear that only one man dropping down but kng comes in on the flank and kng's got three how is he getting away with this the one-man army in this round but founder's still alive he's got three kills of his own and he's looking for the fourth finally trk shuts him down and with 15 seconds left on the clock mibr have got to figure this out and mbk is on the right side of the map he spots the first man damage done to both of them nbk hungry for action he wants this kill but kng denies him a quad kill for kng to kick this game off it will be in many as it's called in north america or maine for some europeans another thing you see that actually maybe it's a resurgence a 2k from isa very very easy as well i'm not sure if a shot was fired that's what the cz can do sometimes alexi be caught in the back though mantu wasn't covering his teammate he might get a chance for a free kill but it's only a tag with the scout now vsm has a chance but that's a headshot through the box and all of a sudden mib are in real trouble here leo and trk have to try and save the day and they're gonna go in towards ramp position's gonna be a problem for mibr two versus three they may feel compelled to push something versus these players although perhaps that would be too difficult you can see mantu lurking on the ramp with the scout while the remaining two are buy double doors in control it might be well positioned for the time being no one here to open decon and offer much more threat leo drunky avoiding the flashbang oh there's an instant trade now which makes things harder for trk and nbk will delete him and indeed og will win the fourth fight a great start with the caesar 75 and a great finish as well yeah that man you pointed out is already showing his value on that a bomb site the defuse is very close but mbk just about has it alexey b has an incendiary there we go another delay for mibr another situation where og can look to reposition players 30 seconds now it's got a flashbang there we go let's be blind for a second things get better for mibr but a spray down from east side good for two but a third man kng will trade and now nbk's alone one versus two 19 seconds on the clock to fly the bomb which is in no man's land finally making it to cover as nbk swings from heaven looking forward to kill will they go for it yes kng just around the corner in time it looks like mibr would rather just have vsm in the back lines relying on their teammates to win them this round which i think will be fine there is a hefty rotation down to b from og but they're not really that on the site itself leo jumping around the corner that's why he's the man with the ump apparently running in first but the trades aren't terrible for og they've actually made it uncomfortable valdo arrives on the site alexi with another shot and all of a sudden it's a 1v1 and alexie b oh it's another fake it's another fake one he's going for the aggression though the kill not gonna happen alexi b wins the round not like this surely oh that's a rough way to lose the round hey guys check out csgo net the best place to unbox your dream skins if you use my code vlad you'll get the biggest 35 bonus to your deposit so if you deposit 100 you will get 135 on your website balance here is an example from my stream where i opened a terraria case for four dollars and managed to unbox a usb kill confirmed for seventy dollars bro three dollars case good luck with your openings and now enjoy the rest of the video if kng is going to have one of these days where he's just unreal that could honestly be a huge difference in this game especially because he hasn't even really got the op yet with how the money's been going he's just been rocking the ak and loving it that's such a cool play what would i do if i was a sniper on a ct side well let me just pull up this smoke grenade oh my god they're all getting deleted nbk walking into a sandwich doesn't realize that he is the meat where less communication is required that might not be the case for these mi br plays which can cause problems like that where things just don't come out fast enough consider moving into the a site now patience is paying off they've got 30 seconds left so far so good kg has been great with the ak i'm saying so far eleven for one make it two bombs been planted leo drunky trying to protect these weapons and positions could manage to do that but yeah i think i looked that first game was i think it was the second of november so that that's actually a really short amount of time lots of players dying at the end of the round here but honestly mibr don't really give a damn they've got a ton of money silently now deacon openly has an angle kg just running past looking for information again spatial awareness from kng looking real good right now but this clock isn't for mibr and then there were two electricity of a very strong angle we've got cover from valdez as well i can concentrate on control here comes isa stereo frags for og and they're finally on the board and all five survive he's just cleared t vents now takes up position oh my god look at these pushes from og and mibr do not realize how much map control they don't have vsm and trk remain two clean rounds from og with no one dying would be such a turnaround for them they could still get eight rounds out of this half which i think they'd be happy with the way this has started so mibr really have to have some impact whether they lose the round or not it doesn't look that way though they know that molly wasn't from trk so they should have all the information see start looking to swing with nbk two man on road here hard for vsm to see through the flames there we go he's uh he's not peaking squeaky 100 of the time which can be to the ct's advantage when he goes to another peak again because they've cleared it already manages to get a kill and information as well nbk round the back trying to stay alive not over peeking waiting for his team to get into position you can see him looking to cover valdez back oh it makes his way but indeed they are going down to the b bomb site now 12 seconds to plant this bomb can't mess around lucas waiting for leo to swing as lucas is the bomb carry up planted just in time he's going nowhere though he's screwed mollied out of position at least leo's been given a chance to maybe do something it just goes for the swing trying to get aggressive with it indeed those walls are paper thin still lurking kg covering the rotation through a which leaves mantu and valde as the last two players now again the money is inconsequential they could risk dropping an awp to kng but apart from that they don't have anything to well i suppose the ak or an m4 but that's it the whole position for now and uh that might make it doable for for them invited the peak suggested they were saving two versus three could be done mantu's quite far away however so might be a solo play from uh valde and again he could just make it as expensive as possible for mibr see if leo can survive he'd be the only one at this point oh no it seems not oh he's all right yeah that be sight the bomb does not do much damage you can actually be on the site still on 100 health and survive from it kng with the ak has been great on this map kind of reminds me in some ways of uh chris j when he used to go the ak just run out on train used to be so dangerous with it awp not always necessary that's something we've seen from kng at least on this map on the t side for mibr something for him to think about in review perhaps five versus three years mantu looks to make a difference now leo running out of bullets will look like be able to finish things off he's got a trade if necessary and then there was alexi b in the last round of the first half we'll see what he can do looking to rotate now bum not planted just yet but vsm will finish the round out for mibr nine rounds in the first half for mibr u250s again we've seen great demonstrations with it it is uh i think i must have in most cases can't say all because if you're going to use utility to close the distance and those glocks come into their own with the extra bullets um but if you're taking a duel at range those p250s are absolutely essential the numbers game being used here by og nbk doing what he can as a swing there from isa not successful because kng is all over this game thus far good shot from vsm lucas trying to run and gun but mantu gets the close range kill with the glock and it's into a 2v3 that means alexa b is going to get that kill and it is a wide open b bomb site here a 2v2 post plant about to come through leo's creeping looking for a lurker convinced somebody was on a ramp and he'll be exposed to the site while he's staring at this to the side which leaves trk alone that defuse kit now top of the ramp trk having a look needs to avoid a double peak if only he had the kit that would be the round surely man two of a swing there's he knows what both are now the one tap has he got another one though he can charge all the way up again the kit is around the corner there alex would be running away but that's fine i'll pick up the kit and go back and defuse the bomb no problem but the chase is on here comes alexi b coming back again looking for those taps and he's just about going to make it that one worked out quite well for mibr almost lost it towards the end but trk should just get a defuse and make it to double figures og looking to combine their forces they're trying to make a megazord but i don't think they've got enough plastic stuck on the roof now shadow advantage will allow lucas to do what he can well og achieved something from this round the reason this round went on for so long is because they're trying to make it expensive there's the shot he was looking for oh goes back for more but mbk with the orc will get the kill leo's already moved into an advanced position though this bomb plant will remain difficult they don't have nades for it the bomb being flighted as we speak but it was a fake and mbk is dealt with only valdo remaining nice headshot onto trk but he's not got the bomb right now and there are plenty of ct's swarming the site as we speak oh dear valdez not even got his gun out kng arriving all the way down onto the b site get me out of here five aks for og alexi b makes his way into a smoke but when he go upstairs or down trying to find something in a he's the only person at present so far so good we've got flashbang support strk tries to make an effort from heaven down 22 hp and kng is here as well the push from vsn will be disastrous and maybe it's not over for og just yet now this is what i was expecting to see more from og on this t side alexi b just exploding out through door and really testing some of the more inexperienced players on mibr leo wasn't able to deal with it in this round there is perhaps still an opportunity for mibr they're thinking about going for this retake trk plopping down the smoke which will work as a one-way he can throw this flash in as well a couple of flashes coming through in fact kng oh how does he get that he's blinded he gets the no scope it's still an opportunity here they gotta smoke the bomb kng not gonna land the shot and that means mantu can spray him down i love that kng gets that noscope dropping down onto the site it's down to half health 30 seconds remaining og are hoping they can perhaps flank on towards this a site alexey b gets the one kill he was looking for but kng confidently peaking it's not going to pay off for him though leo drops the bomb that could be crucial he wants the ak he desperately wants to pick it up he's finally got it and trk is still on the site another kill for mibr leo with the free fight he's going huge in this round he's got a triple kill and mibr have got their 15th round could be the man to do it 28 kills turned into 29. kng sniper has been so good in this game drops a smoke defensively to try and stay alive the flash is reigning in but kmg doesn't care he's going for more he's missed finally but he's done enough for his team to have the advantage you know i believe mibr have all the information now where the remaining og players are which means that they can take liberties with their positions on the remaining players it will be hard for og to press on as these players could be anywhere got some pre-fire from nbk off esm a rare miss from him trk is being spotted as well the quick reload and it's 1v1 nbk maybe ends here shadow advantage for leo drunky but he can't land the final bullets only one more required i've spoken about is clutch as well that was on a ct side that was referring to t side maybe more difficult again that main position will have some shadow advantage if og looked a wrap still with a minute on the clock so many angles for them to deal with as well i look to isolate some fights at the very least then there were two oh god kng start as you mean to go on 33 for 14 an outstanding performance so far finally taken out by nbk 30 seconds and 22 hp lucas is here giving another one versus one running out of bullets though down to one hp now and that will be that trk to finish off the job a great game of nuke from mibr the forces back and forth at the beginning too difficult for og to start off well would come in handy anyway doesn't mean what they're doing is wrong of course trk will have the high ground but for how long i want to stop people getting into oh my god that flick was disgusting well that's a great start from trk sharp as ever and already this bomb site is surrounded it might be on not far to push and speaking of pushing oh gee trying to abuse the numbers while they can believe drunky says no absolute and utter denial vsm ntrk with perfect uh sorry trk with perfect kevlar gets a cheap helmet lucas took one damage not the same for him the ak's autopsy you can see there's a base set up as well so even if he goes down vsn doesn't even need to necessarily engage the first player who peaks you can see them falling back if they didn't that could be the uh the bomb the objective has been seen now in the hands of mantu and he'll lose his jewels with vsm of course oh my god another self grenade causes some panic but og are not in position to do anything about it nbk lurking but trk has made no assumptions he is ready for the duel on short despite the bomb being down on banana 20 seconds remain for esa to do what he can some taps to the old car position some of you newer viewers might not know what that means but there used to be a car there essentially well some extra damage towards the end but it will be 3-0 for mibr and bsn would just make sure mibr defending from the site leo drunky with an off angle now to tell him what might be going on his teammate's been lost so he has to stay alive here for as long as possible the rest of mibr being contained on the a bomb site with nbk holding the rotation with six seconds the bomb is going to be planted and there's nothing else for mibr to do and it is a nice way for og to out position their opponents to win their first round he's so fast with awp does he consider the off angle being played now they've got to stop peeking kng oh my god he's so close again valdez in arch playing on off angle more or less there we go he'll finally be paid off for it but the remainder of mibr already on short bombs not planted just yet leo's swinging there's a headshot can't follow up though neither can trk og survive they prevail and there's a quick response from og they might be setting up some fast aggression towards b yeah there's some aggression for you bsn they're lining up for him with the org though manages to avoid the third player oh that's such a tight angle for mantu but he manages to keep hold of the bomb and nbk will do even better in mid and shut the round down the score is now tied for og i wonder how many surely most of the viewers even like young people will know cotton eye joe won't they i feel like it's played at every like we're not doing this okay we're not doing this we are not doing this according to james i will oblige kng is up close mac 10. this could be nice alexi's not ready ak recovered maybe there is a chance for mibo to get something going here the bomb's yet to be planted kng coming in quickly with the ak and he's got three kills for it it's only manci remaining and this has gone horribly wrong for og they thought they were having a party on the b site but kng was not invited to it he's got three kills and kmg's getting up close as well bomb planted for mantu he's only on 30 health though as he backs off towards ruins he's got to get a quick reaction and it's not going to happen kng with a quad kill suggesting a retake trying to delay but again we can see vsm just had a quick look and he's seen that there's no one top mid but there's no rotation from mibr either 16 seconds now and there's the bait taken by kng the bomb site's been lost mibr may not have responded in time but 3v3 you can see vsm is already here trying to oh my god the angle not high enough however but man he knows his angles two versus three now for mibr that kill would have won them the round there wouldn't have been enough time but unfortunately the spray is slightly off what do lucas and trk have to say about this though two players stacked towards ruins for og that could be a pretty solid setup shadow spotted as well from valder trk gets the first but val is there for the trade he doesn't realize lucas close five but issa is still waiting in the corner still two players on the b bomb site and look at these flanks even if trk just sits here he would have the sound cues of the rotation but he's gonna do more than he's gonna make his way up and he's gonna get a frag immediately kg now stuck at the back of the site he's looking for it might not be a good idea though and kmg just comes out again this man is so aggressive he's got support from lucas with a flashbang as well and deletes the rest of them 16 for five had the 30 bomb on nuke and he's halfway there already that's insane they've got combined eight hp but trk could still have a colossal impact can kng help him though ctrk trying to survive down he goes as does vsm oh my god that is quite a combo oh gee have to be wondering what just happened as well a double molotov kill from alexey b the sunday roast is here ladies and gentlemen get your knives and forks out mibr have had a couple of incredible round wins based off individuals they had that strong start where they took a four nil lead on the ct side but og have still fought through all of that they fought through the treacherous waters now they're out to the other side they're out to the oasis and it is looking lovely for them in this round valder doing even more damage he's got 20 kills at the half it hasn't felt like valdez had any real highlight moments he's just been consistently putting up solid numbers there we go some mollies around the back as well and now it's one versus three for trk that bomb is too far ticked anyway to kill three people and there we go nine rounds for og at half time a great first half of info no we'll see how it continues on the other side seven multi kills so far for valder 132 adr just consistently putting up kills and he's set to continue that in this second half but it's the a play we have to look at it spots the shadows found he gets one it's mantu with two though and it's kng who's alone oh surely he gets he goes for a knife kill here if he gets an angle he's not going to get the angle djz for life let's go mbk with the mp9 goes back to a safer spot and mantu is here to help him oh that molly's doing damage as well really nice shot from trk even getting one kill there is pretty impressive considering the circumstances that that will be all she wrote for mibr in that round it is now 12-6 for og 40 seconds on the clock all of them mibr dude look at the nades for og holy oh look at these molotovs for mibr about to get biblical on this b bomb site as they look to push through the smoke like to be avoids the flashbang but can't avoid trk however his teammates will have a massive cleanup leaving kng he's still looking for a rotator at the very least and one may come eventually 20 seconds to look to have some kind of impact there must be someone on the back surely finds a kill escapes knows he has to do it before time that much is cool however look like they might cruise to victory here on inferno unless mibr can do something in this very round are getting aggressive mantu there to follow him up at least valdo will be traded out but it is still a one-man lead for og ready to try and deny this bomb plant 10 seconds alexi gets it and the time is so low surely mobr can't win from here they want the bomb but they're not going to get it in time there is no time remaining it is og 15 at 6 up on inferno yeah they really took a while i guess coffin plant was impossible with the smoke up a failed attempt from mibr looking to respond quickly however towards the a bomb site leo leading the charge as he often does won't be able to get the entry this time is sir with a solid spray down onto those two players and mbk is in a really nice position here this off angle is so difficult to deal with kng is not ready and lucas is also going to follow his teammate to the grave mbk closes it out 16-6 for og a very decisive second map goes that way mibr hammer fisted into the floor by og in the second map it's all to play for in the third one there was a fast play-up show that would have been or could have been disastrous for mibr and maybe it still will be val they will get a kill in that smoke a quick exchange of pogba just sitting on the ledge for now cloudy having a look top mid that's kng with that p250 had a great performance on both previous maps and there's vsm with a p250 of his own now though the reload could be costly vsm is gonna be careful here that is closing the distance the bomb could be dropped but vsm swings again p250 really paying off in this round it's only nbk remaining and these shots are really hard to hit but he's hit the first the bomb goes tumbling mbk has given himself a great chance by dropping the bomb can he get both of these kills though 35 seconds left at least mibr have some time and they've got the flank but the steps are being heard mbk knows this man is coming but he misses the shot kng comes through with the other p250 nbk had a chance but mibr win the pistol you can see that og are looking to swing it might be off made this very awkward for themselves i haven't boosted anybody on blue either which surely they should do at some point especially people still in the ramp but they will take care of them this will be dealt with they'll only lose one player however trk the only man with health is the closest player the players behind have been tagged and one of them's been fragged mbk with a second surely he can't get away with this and he will not trk finally puts an end to the madness trk coming in by the door looking to use utility to try and limit where isa can hide but this opportunity for og now in spawners and xtv gets a kill onto kng and eso makes it a little easier for them they've got a man advantage before this bombs even planted lucas will tied up once again but which way is he going to go now jumps up not ready to shoot as he gets the two man facing him which leaves leo drunky alone a strange turn of events considering mibr's advantages leo's got a molly here which could come into play as this clutch continues to play out og are going to struggle to clear him from this position that quickly but they're walking in they've walked in already both with their backs turned leo lines them up the transfer comes through og had no clue what hit them as leo gets him from behind so you were pointing out that sometimes that author has to throw flashes for his teammates mantu's not going to have that problem here because valde has long on lockdown right now the issue could be that mantu is the only man defending this site and he's dead that is a huge problem that gets even bigger as alexis b is lost and maybe the round is as well perhaps valde being long may invite og to make their way over but surely it is doomed and from the radar it doesn't seem that og was sure as to what mibr were up to was it a or a b split i feel like i can slowly see my pinnacle points starting to slip away from me james i am concerned right now not looking good for og yeah but mibr could certainly struggle on the ct side as well i'm scared oh my god mancy's got half a chance leo's got no idea you can't be serious leo what are you doing again how on earth does he survive that that leaves nbk alone on the b bomb slide the split is coming once more or is it valde good for one lxd b denied again two one two twenty seconds it's a race to one of the bomb sites somehow og is still in this one isa could play the time now 15 seconds a race car towards the a bomb site he's hiding in situ how on earth could kng even trade in this situation no trade necessary vsm with a strafe cancel straight in the face of esa npk's got to go for this never mind he's dead even before i can finish my sentence it might be i've done well changing the pace from round to round as we saw in that round prior some fortune there with leo drankie who seems almost indestructible at present there's a swing from valdez so much information seeing the bomb they can see he was committing to the a bomb site so many players here they've got to speed up now mibr molotov for the short area we've got ct's hiding in the smoke grenades shrapnel flying over manchu of the awp he's been seen by leo drunky who's making no mistakes here and alejo to try and delay the bomb from being planted a smoke to create some space distraction being run for sure all kinds of junk being thrown at the a bomb site and mibr are falling we might see our first round on the board for og up at first 1v1 3hp for mantu there's still time for vsm to plant this bomb this is chaos carnage no one knows what the hell is happening but vsm knows he can get the bomb down and he knows that mantu was on short does he still know he's there though he goes for it he gets it mantu goes down another round for mibr that's another gun at recoverable and maybe og can make some magic happen in this one issa is pushing all the way through big it's good information but two kills go the way of mibr alexi just swinging with confidence but leo's coming back in he's a bomb carrier though he's got to deal with the bomb because there's a flank issa is in ct spawn he's in a sandwich now leo and down he goes but the bomb's been collected he's run distraction but short's been taken in the meantime by alexi b and now we've got two ak-47s in the hands of og aks versus ak's helmets won't matter too much you've got one long one shot bomb still waiting to get planted and issa just swinging all the way just about misses though as it might be i get behind the box we've got jumping alexi b as well this is absolutely madness 40 seconds on the clock trk one versus two 22 hp waiting for the swing from alexi b where is he so buy the car through the box finally there is a round from og the nbk up close to lining up for him the trades will go in their favor as it's issa to defend this bomb site kmg looking to catch the rotation the red mist from him oh my god that was absolutely beautiful but he's the only one remaining the bomb's been lost 45 seconds what does he choose to do he's got two and a half grand in the bank and then getting a free kill on nbk who can't have expected to have see him holding that angle he is playing some career best counter strike he's gone past the angle but i think it lets you be seen him surely he's seen him in the meantime it might be i've managed to catch up well down goes the flank but mibr making it to the site with no flashbangs and no one falling you're looking for the brazen peacock to validating he knows he knows he's behind the smoke there's no util now for mibr the awp is in long that's gonna be very important for them it's the last round og have to go for it but who is even left nbk with the mp9 won't last long either with either with that have a look at mibr though alexi b is spotting for this he's carrying the bomb he is oh god he just looked to his right hand side even though his teammates are there oh man the timing and counter strike is crazy and there might be i gotta go back again here they come with first a surge of ct officers you know drunky has to go back now the numbers not really favoring him vsm has been dropped on a b bomb site which will be secured by valde and leo drunky moon walks to his doom so it seems that oh you have a fair chance of winning what they need to p 2000 for trk nbk up close and that'll be a okay for og as they take the pistol march needed my other awp is a deagle they really do make that sticker true to form off esm surely gets two here i don't think he's gonna be checked for i don't believe it will he be checked for the flashbangs as well still nothing's happened completely by and there's one looking for the multi fragrance psm there it is is it enough though maybe it is because lucas is coming in from the back and valdez got seven hp one versus two the peak from kng the oh my god a star how could you not be impressed with what they're doing oh boy they're lining up for vsm as well looking to stop isa from making it to that door the bomb lies in weight now for the mibr players on the b bomb site alexey b swinging into his doom 12 match points for mibr what a game of dust too mibr for og i don't know how they'll sleep tonight there's still work to be done however k g's had a lot of sound cues towards this b bomb site from his position oh that was a noble effort from nbk mantu now with no kevlar and valde was six hp now it's mantu running naked in the b bomb site there'll be no mercy given to him by mibr support flashbangs are here and it's all over 16 to 3 from mibr absolutely smashing og on das 2 taking the series in spectacular fashion it must be said [Music] so [Music] you", "i2liG0OT468":

Okay so for the salad, we're going to need lettuce, cucumbers and some tomatoes! No! [Karina} Ronald, you better Be Watching because you're going to have to make a salad too. What? I thought you could make a salad for both of us! Ronald this challenge is where you have to copy what I'm doing! Of course you have to do it. Okay, what are you doing? Okay, I'm separating the lettuce here, and I think that's enough lettuce for me. I'm going to wash it now. (water splashing) (lettuce crunching) Alright, I'm done washing the lettuce, now I'm going to put it in this bowl. Good. There we go. Okay, perfect. Now I'm going to cut up the tomatoes. Okay welcome to Ronald's Kitchen Professional! And today we will be making a gross salad with lettuce and tomatoes. Yay! Okay, so first what you're going to want to do is throw this away.. No, I'm kidding. You have to split up the lettuce. Boring! Okay, so the other two ingredients of my salad are going to be tomatoes and cucumbers! Its a very, very simple salad so Ronald can follow along. I'm still doing my lettuce. (slapping sound) Okay I think I'm finished so now lets wash it!

But what is not good is that I don't know what Karina has up her sleeve. Wait you don't have any sleeves. (Karina and Ronald laughing) Um, I think today we should do some exersize.

No Ronald, you have to build a house with me because you have to do what I'm doing. Okay fine. [Spongebob Narrator] Two hours later. Ronald, enough with playing. I'm hungry, so I'm going to go to a restaurant. That means you have to come too. Yes! I'm starving. I'm going to have a nice crispy burger inside my tummy. So we're at a restaurant and we're here to have dinner because you can't just have one salad for the entire day. So, I'm going to look through the menu and see what I like. Um, I'm going to head to the salad section. They have a salad section here. Salad? Salad. I want a burger, Karina. I don't want a salad. I think I want to get the green salad. Oh my goodness, that's literally the worst option, Karina, no! Lets get a burger, come on! No Ronald. Burgers have too many calories. I have to get a salad.Ive got to stay healthy. Two salads today. Yeah, this one has chicken in it. Yeah this one comes with chicken, so it has a little bit of chicken. Okay at least some calories today. Alright so, I guess that's what we're going to order.

Since we're right next to the mall. No! Come on! We can get some nice dresses, some cool shirts, girly things, you know? So guys! We're at the mall and I got some shoes so Ronald had to get some shoes too. And we're going to continue shopping , maybe walk around, get a few more things. Wait, Karina, can we please go home? I had enough today. Please! Fine. I guess so. Yes, yes! Finally you said yes! `Yes! Alright, lets go back home, I guess. So guys. We're back home and I'm kind of tired, so I think I'm going to go to sleep. Wait, what? You're going to go to sleep this early? Its like 9 o'clock, Karina! Ronald can't do anything about it! Because If I go to sleep, you have to go to sleep too. I'm going to get payback. Some day I will get payback! So guys, I think I'm just going to give Ronald a break here, I'm going to go to sleep, he can go to sleep, have rest, and when he wakes up tomorrow he has a full day of not copying me. And right after that, you're going to copy me for twenty four hours! No, no! I'm not doing that! Yes! Give a like is Karina should copy me for twenty four hours! Its only fair! No!

monday thursday and saturday at 4 pm eastern discussing various men's lifestyle topics such as style grooming and dating i invite you to subscribe tap that notification bell and join us and to my returning friends like dr gary johnson salute now whether it's due to societal pressures self-induced pressures not wanting to be embarrassed or feeling like it's just something men don't talk about

style g channel is a safe haven we can talk about these things without fear of judgment and that's exactly what we're going to do we're going to talk about 10 things men don't admit but probably wish they could so without any further delay let's hop right into it now the first thing most men won't admit we're gonna go a little light-hearted on this one men love to gossip just as much or maybe more than women i firmly believe this to be true think about it when you were back in high school if you got a kiss or anything else from a girl you ran to tell all the details to your friends and your friends were all ears to hear it not only that think about how excited we get about sports trade rumors how we're just as much into pop culture as a lot of women don't let any man tell you any different we enjoy gossip just as much as women do we love to stick our nose in and hear and spread other people's business whether at work or play trust me men like to gossip now next up we have a little bit more of a serious topic and one men definitely don't like to admit but i'm here to tell you they most of the time feel this way we're much more concerned about losing our hair than we care to say now i've heard many guys say if i start to lose my hair i'll just cut it all off i won't try to keep it i call bs and i'll admit i was that guy when i started losing my hair i said man i'll just get a baldy who cares here we are years and years later and i'm still doing light tricks and angles to try to get you guys not to see i have the hair struggle men really do care about losing their hair we're a lot more vain than you might think and it's the one struggle we have much more than the ladies do this male pattern baldness we want to hold on to our hair if we can nothing wrong with admitting that now if you're someone like me who has dealt with or are concerned about hair loss i highly recommend you go to keeps.com style and check out today's video sponsor keeps did you

get started with doing something about your male pattern baldness today another thing men definitely struggle to admit but i'm here to tell you a lot of us do experience it men don't admit that they get lonely now for a lot of us especially as we progress through adulthood we lose some of our older friendships but it becomes more difficult to get new relationships especially because we're not in the same environments where you make long-lasting friends most of the time in school but as we get older we don't lose the need for male bonding so as some of our friends start to fade away loneliness can creep in and on top of that guys that are single most of them don't really want to be they'd rather have a girlfriend but in today's culture a lot of times guys would get called ascent for even expressing the idea of wanting a woman on a side note that's not what a symptom is as human beings we're not meant to experience life alone but as we progress through adulthood it's harder to keep and maintain good friendships and relationships this can lead to loneliness a lot of guys are experiencing it but don't admit it now right along with not wanting to admit loneliness there are other emotions that guys won't express but i'm promising you they do experience them we have a full range of emotion as human beings and an emotional a lot of times we don't get to express what we do have is sadness so a lot of guys including myself from time to time enjoy a nice cry now i'm not saying we're crying every weekend or boo hoo anytime someone hurts our feelings that's not what we're doing but every once in a while we do enjoy a nice cry it's cathartic you feel better afterwards a little secret between me and you we're friends here i'll occasionally watch a sad tv show or movie just to get a good cry out i don't cry that often about things that happen to me but i'm an empathetic person if i watch a sad tv show or movie the tears will come out and i feel better afterwards and i'll admit it for all of us a lot of guys like to have every once in a while a good cry now on a lighter note there's something especially if you're watching this channel a style channel that a lot of us guys really like but may not admit all the time just like the women do we like nice things now pop culture is usually shown that the women like nice things diamonds fancy clothes purses but if you're a style guy like me you like nice stuff just as much whether it's a great pair of shoes a fancy car the latest oled tv we like nice things too but being as though normally we're shown as providers not receivers sometimes we don't like to admit that we like nice things for ourselves just like we like to give them to others and i'm here to let you know it's okay to one and strive for nice things for yourself nothing wrong with that most guys won't admit it but we like nice things too now piggybacking off that last one i mentioned how a lot of times we won't admit we like nice things because first of all we're supposed to provide for others and one of the things sometimes men won't admit the ability or the lack thereof to provide is something that's really important to us and when a man doesn't have the ability to provide it makes him feel emasculated either by others or by self-induced pressure that's why a lot of times it's such a big deal about how much money we make we want the ability to provide and when we lose a job or aren't making as much money as we would like to we don't feel as good about ourselves i'm here to tell you that's okay and i actually feel it's natural as i mentioned i believe a guy's drive is to be able to provide and protect when a guy isn't able to do it to the level he would like it bothers him he might not admit it but it does the next thing that i know a lot of guys won't admit but they do quite often many men compare themselves to others now this comparison can come in negative or positive ways if you're comparing yourself in a negative way it can come off as jealousy or envy but if you're using comparisons in a positive way it can be inspiring and motivating to see what other guys do just think about it most of us guys came up playing sports we like to compete so as life goes on we're still competing with others whether they know it or not that's where comparing comes in we all do it sometimes in a healthy way sometimes not i would submit and encourage you to compare with one person first the guy in the mirror you should want to be a better version of you than you were the day before that's who you want to compare yourself to but i'll be the first to admit it a lot of times we compare ourselves to others now one of the things that i believe is universal for guys whether they admit it or not we all fear rejection think about it most men we can't avoid getting rejected whether it's for a job we want a school we want to get into but more often than not we will face rejection when it comes to the opposite sex and i found that many guys won't even approach a woman because they fear rejection even the guy who has enough confidence to go up and talk to a woman he's afraid of rejection too i want you guys to know that aren't as successful with women even the smoothest flash guy in the world gets rejected a lot no matter how cool a guy may seem to you life gives us all more no's than yes's so although it's natural to fear rejection it's unavoidable it's part of being a man the ability to face your fears and endure these rejections to get the yeses that's part of the process but we all must admit we do fear rejection now next up is another thing i feel a lot of guys don't admit but i believe it's universal every guy wants to feel appreciated especially if a man is going about his life doing the right things he wants to feel appreciation from the people in his life that matter i just believe it's a human thing it's a natural desire to be appreciated for the hard work and the things that you do and as a subset of this for my guys that are in relationships a lot of times we would love to receive more compliments from our lady yes men like to receive compliments and this is one i bring up to my lady i don't have a problem seeing it most of the time we're used to giving out appreciation giving out compliments it's the gentlemanly thing to do and no i don't expect my lady to compliment me anywhere near as much as i compliment her but every once in a while it feels good it's just a form of appreciation we all want it we all desire it even though we don't admit it men love to feel appreciated next up we have something men definitely don't admit very often but i guarantee you they experience it all men have insecurities i don't care how successful unsuccessful happy or unhappy a man is he has some things he needs to work on and he doesn't feel that great about definitely doesn't feel good admitting these shortcomings to other people in actuality i'm not a firm believer that you're supposed to share these insecurities all the time with other people but what i do advise you to do admit these insecurities to yourself committing your insecurities to yourself allows you to identify them and thus be able to work on them if you don't first admit them you can't fix them although a lot of things we talked about admitting in this video they were more about admitting to others insecurities need to be acknowledged on the inside and from time to time sharing these insecurities with others can be beneficial as well but at the minimum i want you to identify and admit your insecurities to yourself only then can you acknowledge them work on them and reduce them now admitting these things we talked about on today's video whether to others or to yourself can be very healthy very beneficial it doesn't make you any less of a man to admit problems or concerns that you may have yes some of them may be embarrassing but just sometimes getting them out makes them a lot better and i promise you not only you but me and most guys experience some of these things on this list they just don't admit it now as always i love to get your input let us know something in the comment section either you or other guys hate to admit but we all know it's probably true", "0i2rqmIb5Go": "i don't know purge i'm just so excited that we have a game three here going on and we already got some action might have a first place yeah we'll get vision of it here there's a lot of stunts here right back in throughout illuminated scenes a little bit longer but they might be able to turn this around they might be able to get a kill on no tail although boxy going and throwing out that uh astro imprisonment gonna have them to split off and this is not looking great now for mickey's he's supposed to use the very fire one right here still gonna go down top so he gets himself a double kill looks like a great mid lane for him to start off with but they could turn this back around thompson did he get 17 hit points he's gonna be able to survive this should be able to go and get this kill tiger's gonna be able to walk away he goes and pops his own stick foxy waiting does not of course have that meteor hammer just yet going for the dive here look at this look at all the tp's coming out they're saying god why is boxy allowed to do this he should not be allowed as thompson who fakes his rotation gives himself a kill the fall of the lyric right there five boom speed one can they go and take down tiger fast enough it's looking like they'll be able to find it from the back lines he's just having such a dangerous time here as he's just getting chomped away by all those weapons but over the back like that he does fall no tail still trying to play ring around he's trying to get away he's like please help me assembly another spell so i think it'll be fine [Applause] opening up they have the rupture with the blood right foxy making his way over here nice step down over to the bottom side but people keep dodging around stepping forward they get them linked up here with the gripsy double sided coming out as well so quickly here nice thing coming out from fox he's gonna be able to keep him alive goes down over on the side mid one thinking he wants to go back in again but he's getting kind of mickey might need a little bit of help here he has to be here he'll get the first life of the great king they turn right back around tyga roll it on out kill also kind of lucked out he rolled through some neutral creeps therefore mickey could kill them and then re-engage with more hp it was really sick what a fight for liquid and now let's take it in ages even better here he's taking too that gets taken down here we go get the full bind out box because bkb hasn't just run out this is not looking for the others he's gonna get sliced apart from the back lines tyga he's not gonna be able to roll away from this one thompson getting himself a nice double kill they have to deal with the illusions and then the blow sticker is going to be fine basically but they kind of just like went all in right away he got completely surrounded and they ain't trapped doesn't have facebook he wants treads on bloodseeker so i think he just got stuck in there nobody wants aegis uh yeah question mark a wraith king doesn't want it ck is probably comfortable not having it all right mid one oh mid one he wanted to you should do [Applause] coming out though from the side of og they're hoping that they can get themselves a nice pick off here no tails just charging at koi spa immediately though the bkb coming out rolling in over onto the back lines tyga trying to make things happen here gets off the magnetizer gonna be able to go they take now they're turning their attention over here a little bit to foxy and they talk down over on tops and koi says up they're running around they take down boxes they'll chase down again he's doing so much work here coming up don't take down step can they grab ned wonder look at mickey he's a race car just running over there they need something to cancel tv never mind they don't need anything off the tv because they're just gonna take him down for his first flight they'll go back in a second time can they get the kill again i'll bring him in one yesterday on a killing spree hiding in the trees he says oh please god please no it's just a circle of chains down he goes in the forest the buy-back coming out now from seb over here on the chaos tonight the kids forward at the brush should be coming up but they have the abyssal blade coming out here from the mickey oh the hammer gets dropped sadie is just taking him out here as they chase after no tail no hope for him tower is under attack that's a die back it is indeed maybe it's fine look at the way that liquid is just chewing through these buildings jumping onto the back lines going onto boxes the ball's good though we'll leave them together hold them in place with the blood right here tiger rolling around they have the bkb up and running over here on to mid one but they still take that bouncing he is gonna fight back over onto the ground there's one chalking away tyga is just going to roll on out they can go back in again that's true coming out they have another dark portrait just running out to the back like this is looking like a first time dead here for the side of this race king and it's looking like he's about to go down right here right now double kill buy back coming out from racing he's going to be very careful he can't afford to die back radiant they're going to hit the kick they're going forward they're going right for it they've got the creeps radiant stretchers are for they've got the damage by god they're sending the boys out say hey get these guys off of our buildings a little scary for liquids not terrible and they're controlling boisterous so easy got another dark portrait up they just they're just you know what they're just painting for just left and right mid one jumping in though immediately the silence the save coming out from boxing trying to get them off of these buildings it's so hard there's a big crate coming out here mickey backing off they have the offensive plate that they go they jump right back over at the top midfield can they kill tyga no they have not been able to take him down just yet okay now he goes he follows but boxie goes down thompson goes down the five bags are coming out foxy coming right back and so is tyga mid one he's got that reincarnation again coming back up can they kill boyfriends he's locked down it's looking pretty good he's trying to run he can not midway gets himself a double kill no buyback over here on this lichen they have to do this because if they don't buy back lycan their opponents can maybe posture for it midwives oh they have five euros he's in the pit they see him he's not gonna jump on him just yet they're gonna put the ink swell out they'll just go turn around they'll take down the vision tyga though rolling forward here that finds box though mickey jumping over really good stuff he dies down and now it's looking like they'll get stocks uh they'll wait patiently here for mid one he's trying to run away he cannot escape liquid they go and they banish him up yet again with the meteor hammer no-till tries to do anything that he possibly can to try to save his kingdom no tail gets taken down team wipe over on the side of o.g and that is almost surely going to be the game unless you can defend yourself they gotta be so amped with this game they played it very well they had great hero counters they dealt with the pressure of their boat and they had to win the series this was their only chance to make it to the major was

into this mental health checking so mr health is doing good i had a good conversation with my mother today um i'm in the process of doing something kind of big but i'm kind of nervous about it um but i'm enjoying it but i'm nervous and i probably talk about that a little bit more um probably over there in miss patreon and where i feel like i'm at home because girl the haters don't don't watch patreon but if you are a hater you need to watch patreon but uh yeah like other than i'm doing really good this weekend was good for me um i you know used my time wisely i sat and thought and did some stuff that i need to do um but i hope y'all had uh actually this weekend was not i think about it see today is better so since yesterday and today has been better that made me forget like this yeah it was some drama that happened this weekend girl i was not here for it uh but i got in the battle spirit um sunday so that's really good so i only by the time i had got by the time i was gonna tell you all about it i had got better because i know a lot of y'all was like girl what's going on because i had two i said it was the worst day ever i had misplaced my wallet it was something my wallet was missing with some other drama going on um it was just and i was running late for this thing it was just like oh my gosh remember i told y'all the last week when you get a sign like you trying to leave the house and everything is going wrong it's like you might sit down that was happening saturday and i was just like what's going on like what's the t girl like i got to do this stuff like i can't so what's going on so maybe i should just sat my hands down see i didn't listen to myself and see what it got me but i'm doing better today um i hope you are doing better um and um let's go ahead and get into the tea for today the tip of the day is i don't even know where to start at i'm gonna start at the grammys so the grammys what was it the 63rd annual grammys came out she came on girl and the viewership dipped almost 50 percent the girls are not watching the grammys um the grammars did everything they was like they were trying to do to get folks to watch and people still were not interested i cannot wait for these institutions to fall apart i am loving it but it seems like the grandmas might have a trick on this week because it seems like they're trying to do a duet or some type of thing with tick tock for next year because they're losing viewers remember i talked to remember king's garb when i told you all about how tv is um you know dying how cable tv is dying and they're looking for stuff that is online streaming remember we had that conversation on patreon this is that so the cable that cable tv gram is that the institution is falling apart so they're reaching out to tick tock like that's where the content is at nobody's watching the cable like folks are watching tick tock um so they're trying to pull them to save them when tick-tock don't need the grammys tick-tock don't need it make them feel good make them feel a little bit more established but they don't need it so i had that conversation for those who can go go to picture and check her out so that's what we got what's going on with the grammys um they gave out some nomination they snubbed a whole bunch of foes let me tell you something i'm not going to talk about um the white folk stuff i just don't really care um i don't i didn't listen to taylor swift's album i'm not going to ever listen to no taylor swift music unless i'm shopping at a shoe carnival that's probably about as close i would get while i'm in h m and i can't fit anything in hm so i can't really see the need for me to be listening to taylor swift's music um so that's just that on that um so she won something billy eyelash billy eilish won something then said that she should like make it should have got it i'm tired of you you white girls doing that like you know if you don't do it just do it just do it if y'all want to be bold say hey girl come and mix up this war i don't deserve this that's that on that and leave that's it like that's it like do that and move on about your business but y'all know what it is like y'all are trying to be the the uh y'all are trying to be the gentrifiers that are the white gentrifiers that shop locally to make themselves feel better or the folks like well i'm gonna be vegan to uh i'm gonna be a white vegan and i'm gonna save the planet girl no ma'am it's just like it might make you feel good but it's not really doing anything um it's just about it's a vibe it's a vibe that's about it that's how it's giving um so talk about that i am shook at queen bee beyonce on that stage when trevor noah was like we made history we made history we made history girl he had said that one more time i was going yeah i was gonna blow up but beyonce was like hold on this ain't in the program that look that she gave beyonce gave me a look because she's like girl i don't like surprises i don't like speaking publicly i just like to give up and give y'all a look and perform and i ain't doing none of that so don't be trying to have me do nothing like and she said oh okay so she broke um you know her story okay uh as being like the first person to have as many um you know um awards as anybody like which what the [ __ ] does that mean excuse me what does that mean at the end of the day when she still has been snubbed when it comes to album of the year or record of you like what does that mean whichever ones that she didn't get because i can't remember what does that mean like what does that mean when she got slowed like two times over there like girl come on like let's let's stop y'all can't keep talking about the impact of the culture how influential black folks are and then the white folks accept the wolves and then y'all it's just like girl i'm tired i am tired but you know what i'm even more tired of i am tired of the grammy institution period i am tired of the grammar institution i didn't even watch it to be honest when it came on sunday i didn't watch it when i i didn't even watch the monday i watched it today and i went through all the black performances that's all i wanted to see that's all i was interested in getting into girl um and some folks gave me life and some folks did but i wasn't like i you know i'm just i'm tired of the grammys i'm tired it's just like every every year i get so tired of this conversation about the grammys like oh girl they did this wrong they snubbed us they did us wrong like they need to do better they need to them white folks don't care y'all say this every year it's so weird because when your favorite artist doesn't win an award you're dragging it dragging a dragon but then when your artists win the war you talk about the importance of it i'm even to the point i'm talking about this like there's a lot of artists who are extremely talented who missed who did not get a grammy who are extremely timidly put out nice bodies of work doesn't take away but we're still integration but we're so interested in this validation from this white institution saying and we do understand the monetary value of it that's why we should be that's why we should be entering capitalism anyway because folks should be creating content and creating stuff because they want to not because they want to make money and getting accolades for white folks period but they understand the monetary value of saying grammy award-winning honest artists and all the other stuff grand grammy-nominated artists actually someone wrote a sickening article talking about that and talked about how black artists don't show the support to these other shows who are giving them the the representation they are so seeking like that that's what what confuses me and i think there was an interview or something that um there was something written about beyonce seeing how she didn't show up to grammys one year because she felt disrespected actually should but she was there this sunday but i think she was mainly there because of meg and nostalgia but beyonce you look good girl i will say that baby you served a love baby her and her favorite capitalist husband they look beyonce looked good she looked gorgeous and she was giving oh my god she was giving um but yeah so um enjoyed that shout out to megan the stallion for winning her awards i'm so happy for her she definitely deserves it there's some folks who press i think rodney rich is pressed about his stuff and then little baby was pressed about his stuff and all that other stuff um i really don't care about male rappers just really dog y'all ain't been moving the bar y'all been selling stuff but the influence is not it has not been strong to me and compared to a mega and the stallion like it's just it's not been no cultural movement for me it's y'all selling stuff and then honestly male rappers it's so easy for y'all to sell like it's so easy for y'all to say like y'all don't have to do much work don't even y'all don't even change outfits when y'all perform like y'all perform y'all even dancing y'all stuff y'all walk around doing this the whole time shut up y'all ain't doing no work these female artists are here changing outfits wearing 8-10 pounds worth of clothing to give us um give us looks because the show with no performance but to give us something y'all rap don't do nothing but digs and girl majority of the folks probably buying y'all albums and buying your music white because they want to be close to blackness without being pulled over by the police so i really just don't care to be honest um so yeah so i think megan definitely deserved um tmz tried to debate megan and asked her about you know how she feels about the you know black folks not winning awards or something she was like black folks i win it was i got my award they tried to make it seem as though she was trying to like snub folks and say i'm like girl i just can't stand tmc for that reason maybe trying to all type of stuff but congratulations to megan stallion um let's talk about some of these performances i want to start off with girl it's a couple um megan stallion making stallion loved the performance i love the performance maybe you did good you did really good you looked good i loved the um tap dancing um the homage i paid everything i felt that love those two women tap dancing i love that the outfit everything you looked amazing your makeup look good your hair everything you just looked gorgeous loved the performance love the men and the um in the nike shoes with the with the suits it was just like the dances looked good the dancers were dancing they was getting megan was giving one two stairs let me see yo megan was getting it uh we moved over to cardi b um's performance uh for what the setup the stiletto pump heel big dancing i thought that was so sickening the big bed i was like yes give us stage give us everything girl because the performance was not there girl it was just not there now let me because i know y'all gonna drag me but y'all know i don't give a damn anyway um cardi b that performance wasn't it girl like their performance was terrible i don't know like you had some headlines like cardi b ripped the stage ripped what i thought i had read i thought she had ripped the outfit or something because she damn show that rip don't stay there like girl she ripped her hair what happened because she ripped on stage if anything is it's a tear like she might have but girl not a little bit of tear like we can we can cover her up but it wasn't tore she totally staged up it was a real a little a rip you try to rip it the drink because she can rip the stage up girl it was like she even shred it was just not a good performance like every when she was moving just seemed like she was one two stepping when i said one two stepping i mean she was like one two step let me everybody get on the floor it was given one two three four she was lip syncing for her life like since with lip syncing for her life as she should uh but it was just sloppy it was just sloppy she looked amazing the hair gave me bone like i loved her wig she had a little short wing and she was moving it i said yes cardi but the performance was just not there the performance was terrible it was bad it was just so bad and she and folks were saying well she was um probably tired because the outfit that she had on was weighing eight to ten pounds we taking this [ __ ] because how she performed and the performer was sickening y'all would have said yes look how cardi ate that and while when uh wearing a whole 10 pound outfit she should have been dancing and practicing in the outfit honestly the outfit was cute she could have just did a one-two and took that off and performed but it's just the performance was just terrible it was garbage and i'm not gonna let this slide because there hadn't been anybody else who did that you know exactly what i'm talking about had there been anybody else y'all would have been eating sis alive y'all have been eating them too [ __ ] as you should but girl it was given um girl it was just bad it was just a bad performance she looked good beautiful gowns beautiful gowns but that's it as you can see this video gonna be gonna be long so it might be a part two because i'm spending like 15 minutes just on the grandmas by itself but she gave moving on let's talk about little babies performance yes groundbreaking honey yes we love to see black death what makes us move more than black death yes by performed by celebrities because girl we have to continue to see this imagery that everyday black folks who are not out here spending two million dollars on chains and stuff are more than likely to experience in real life because because we don't have no security walking us around and we we we out here we are in these wendy's okay we are pulling up in the winter so while you talking about black folks out here and and giving this performance like we are supposed to experience and y'all i'm i'm tired i did a whole video about this on patreon i don't care how y'all feel about it i don't need to see any more black death performed like this i don't want to see it get it off the tv i said the same thing when i saw simone on on rupaul's drag race with this white fascinate on her head with bullet holes somebody remember their names i do remember their names it's i can't remember their names it's too many so what are we doing other than awareness because y'all get to awareness and it just stops there's nothing else what y'all gonna tell us to go to the polls y'all gonna go to the polls tell us to go to the polls again so they can tell us that they can't give us fifty thousand dollars too long debt uh eradicate it so they can tell us they can't get to 15 000 this week or they can't get to this this week what is it after awareness let me know what is it after awareness you have letting us know that this happened what's next how long are y'all going to use this excuse for awareness before we do something what is it because y'all don't have no damn solutions y'all don't have any and the fact that you don't even have to have no solutions to have a point but y'all not proving anything behind some white folks to pretend like they being police in bright gear what does that mean we've seen that [ __ ] all on the tv this year what does that mean what does that mean we're tired and there's a whole conversation happening because my girl chica who i love so much who's a brilliant ass rapper female rapper who's extremely talented revealed that she was turned off by yg's uh music video that he did was just kind of playing up on black lives matter she said she didn't like it and she said she was in a celebrity group chat talking about it she was in a celebrity group chat talking about it i'm like a celebrity no not a celebrity group chat y'all let me rewrite myself in a black lives matter celebrity group chat so you got all these black lives matter folks so you got all these celebrities who are in this black lives matter celebrity girl that sounds like a damn game show and somebody said it's hosted by jamie foxx i screamed i asked people who you think would be hosting somebody said jamie foxx i think somebody else said uh amanda seals but celebrity black live black lives matter celebrity group chat like what the hell so i'm looking like i'm looking at this i'm just like i'm looking at the performance with a little baby i'm just like why i'm not moved by this [ __ ] that [ __ ] don't move me like y'all do that y'all do this and y'all right here getting corn to do all this you got tamika mallory getting her ass up there talking and all that [ __ ] like endorsed by wells fargo endorsed by it's just like girl i'm tired i'm tired of this performative ass activism that y'all be doing these celebrities are making money off of doing these things like they are making beaucoups of money performing this stuff there's no sacrifice and that is what tamir rice mother brought up some um what was her name samira rice brought up is that y'all are out here you know not making any sacrifices y'all making money like the same thing that happened ferguson y'all like oh i have to pull up that video i had watched early like i'm going there girl video i had watched earlier uh um i cannot pronounce let me make sure i'm saying the name elaine brown who is an ex-panther she drafted she said the same thing happened in ferguson when folks built a platform built a brand off of the bones of ferguson and then turned around and there was nothing done that was like they didn't take care of people the people um turned around and unfortunately elected another um you know another white mayor in the city that's 60 70 close to black so it's just like girl since went in she said because ain't nobody offended pigs like they used to but what is that what are the consequences when these folks out here doing some of these when the state is out here doing it what are the consequences but they ain't gonna be out here doing that they're not out here doing it they just give us a performance it's just a performance rescue beautiful gowns beautiful guy and i'm just tired i don't i don't want to see that number one like i like it's just it's too much every time i turn around if somebody hands up don't shoot and y'all do a music video y'all doing like it's just i'd understand the need to to to react to the sign of the times in music and your art and all of that but some of y'all do it to the point that it is like for profit it is y'all profiting off of it like it's it's just a mess and and you know it's always this to sean king period um sean king out here responding to mira rice and then trying to drag her and use you know misogyny to justify his his his read like it was just it's got i just i'm so irritated looking at that girl i moved and went down you see how they went down because i got pissed off talking about people um so yeah girl that's that's a whole mess but those are my thoughts i think on the grammys and all that girl like i might want to be a stand-alone video for the grammys but it's not just kangaroos video because now we got to talk about kurt franklin and this whole cussing out his son stuff so girl go ahead and head to part two cause we finna get it [Music]", "aO3xqs2A2-M": "yeah you know jeffy's been somebody's [ __ ] for the past three weeks right i know hey what's up cj

hot topics y'all we have a lot to go over so first things first i want to give you guys a royal family update prince william is coming out and he's telling the world that his family is not racist all right then i want to get into some real housewives of atlanta t y'all's favorite og miss joggers herself mr ray whitfield is coming for kenya more hair care on following her on instagram and i have a feeling that this is a ploy like i said before to return to the show and then i want to talk about some basketball wise t um in my tyra voice oh gee we were rooting for you okay we were all rooting for you but at this point girl you're just becoming annoying okay and then last but not least can we talk about raw housewives of beverly hills star miss erica jane and her husband it's looking like tom has officially lost his law license okay so we're gonna get into that and so much more if you guys like the video give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to the youtube channel and let's get straight into the video so let's dive right into the mess first things first can i give you guys a royal family update okay y'all know me when the harry and megan interview first aired i really didn't care much about it i was just like okay it is what it is it's gonna be what it's going to be until after it aired okay and a lot of the drama started popping off that's when house aaron got interested okay and so um you guys know that megan and harry made some explosive claims basically saying that you know megan's mental was in decline she went to the palace for help and they refused okay they refused to give her any resources and then they also said that there were conversations and concerns about how dark their baby arty would be once he was born well that got everybody talking y'all and everybody's looking at queen elizabeth the second like hmm is the monarchy racist okay is the royal family racist well reporters caught up with harry's brother prince william to ask him the question himself and prince william said that the royal family was very much not a racist family in his first public comments on the interview given by his brother prince harry and his sister-in-law meghan markle okay now this isn't very surprising okay this is very typical because do y'all really think the royal family is gonna come out and say yes we're racist okay do you think whoever had the concerns about how dark baby archie was gonna be is gonna come out and say yeah i said it just call me rihanna all right do you think they're gonna come out and say that absolutely not and so like the queen said they're gonna deal with this privately but i wouldn't be surprised if they don't deal with it at all and if they just sweep it under the rug all right so let me know what you guys think about that situation moving right along child can we talk about miss cheray whitfield okay now cheray has been in the blogs a lot lately okay she's been getting a lot of attention and i came on here a couple of weeks ago and told you guys that i feel like charade is on a campaign to be back on the housewives of atlanta for season 14 because not only did she you know commentate on an episode with dwight okay that aired on bravo not too long ago but she appeared on watch what happens live and she's also been all over tmz with her man mr tyrone that recently got out of jail well cheray is making headlines again because it's looking like she has unfollowed one of our season five queens okay miss kenya more hair care and i'm not confused okay about this situation not today because i know exactly what sheree is doing so i got when that charade unfollowed kenny moore hair care recently um i'm not going to put up the screenshots you can go to kenya and charades page and type in everybody's name okay and see who's following who but uh we know that cheray has recently unfollowed kenya and kenya soon thereafter unfollowed charade back now you're wondering why okay what would be the reason well maybe it has something to do with charade's appearance on watch what happens live all of a month ago where cheray caught herself being messy asking about walter and then kenya combated her with the fact that you know you have a whole man who's in jail hmm check this clip out can you say three things that you missed about walter [Music] you have to give me something about your guy in jail now you guys saw that okay you saw how messy charade was being and kenya in that clip looked kind of shocked okay she was clutching her pearls like did this woman really ask me about an ex-boyfriend from seven years ago okay and kenya got her ass back together talking about some girl you have a whole jail bird as a boyfriend so don't try it and so maybe that exchange has something to do with the fact that now in today's time sheree has unfollowed kenya but it is super obvious that charade is fighting to get that peach back okay let me know what you guys think about the situation down in the comments below all right you guys so let's move on to something a little bit different can we talk about the basketball of the wives okay can we talk about basketball wives now o.g if you're listening darling um we were rooting for you okay we were all rooting for you but um you're kind of fun with the bosses and at this point i kind of need you to walk away okay i'm going to need you to walk away from the show because it's just not meshing it's just not happening and um we're not getting anywhere now i do think that there was a colorism issue last season i think the ladies uh didn't like og because they thought she was ugly they didn't like the way she looked these are their words not mine because they definitely called og ugly and they definitely called her a monkey right and so i do think colorism uh played a part in why there was such a divide between og and the rest of the ladies uh they just didn't like her african features okay and we do know that features is a faction of colorism with that being said um on this current season of basketball wise i kind of feel like og is so you know uh disgusted by the rest of the ladies and i feel like she's very disconnected from the rest of the ladies that she kana is unaware that she has this chip on her shoulder which is making everyone old and new cast members not like her okay and so very quickly i wanted to mention um oh gee is now upset with jennifer okay she's upset with jennifer because jennifer called kristen noble for being brave enough to come to the other house and have a civilized conversation with ogee and when jennifer said that kristen was noble for that og got upset okay og got upset and started saying um girl no okay kristin isn't noble you need to stop coddling her and hold her accountable for what she's done and i'm looking at og like girl i'm gonna need you to take several seats okay not one not two but several seats because at this point how is you gonna control what jennifer thinks and what jennifer says okay i was just a little bit confused at the situation and so it seems like og is trying to control the narrative right we know that she's on instagram after every episode complaining about the editing and complaining that they're making her look this type of way but oh gee they're not making you look bad you are just bossy and you want to spin this narrative and it's not working out for you okay um the editors to me are capturing what is actually happening in the house right so don't be upset at the editors be upset at yourself or with the other ladies okay the editors ain't got none to do it is but with that being said we know that og also got upset with the twins uh because i guess the twins were speaking for her and brought some of the revelations from og's past to the other ladies which i could kind of understand where og is coming from like don't speak for me if i tell you something don't go run back and tell somebody else but they did it with good intentions right and at the end of the day this is a reality television show and so everything you say is going to be taken and ran back to the other group that's just how this works okay if you don't know how tv works by now i'ma need you to go back and watch the previous seasons of basketball wives now i say all of that to say that og has a problem with the twins jennifer shawnee kristin malaysia evelyn okay at this point and i wouldn't be surprised if jackie is on the list of people that og does not mess with and at this point it's just kind of like oh gee you cannot ostracize yourself you know from the entire group like you have to play this you know in a strategic manner and right now you're just not okay you look crazy okay you look crazy you look like your claims of colorism are just you spewing things just to spew them when i personally think that they're legitimate but you're diluting your message because you're being bossy you're being kind of mean and you're being very controlling of the situation okay so i don't know those are my opinions definitely let me know what y'all think about the situation down in the comments below last but not least i didn't want to mention erica girardi and her husband tom um their situation is very crazy and i actually stopped talking about it on the house of aaron because i just kind of felt like every day it was something new and i just could not keep up like i didn't know what was true what wasn't what was rumor what was fact okay it just became too much and i'm just like okay i can no longer talk about erica and her husband tom because it's just a hot ass mess but i didn't want to mention this to you guys according to some sources tom girardi the husband of housewives of beverly hills star erica jane has had his law license okay revoked amid allegations he embezzled from his clients girardi who is 81 has alzheimer's disease and is unable to participate in court proceedings according to a psychiatrist assessment filed in the case that was obtained by the rep okay girardi is of course accused of misappropriating more than two million dollars in funds and so um i don't know okay i don't even know what to think of this because it's just all a little bit too much she has a lot of explaining to do on this upcoming season of beverly hills and i really hope the girls get into her [ __ ] okay i don't want the girls to bully her i don't want them to gang up on her but i do want them to hold her accountable and really kind of make her talk about these things because she's been at the forefront of trying to force and pry out information from everybody else and so i just want erica to be transparent and honest with the viewers about what the hell is going on and you know i feel bad for tom if he has alzheimer's disease like that's pretty serious so let me know what you guys think about the entire situation down in the comments below i'mma wrap it up right here okay let me know what you guys think about basketball wise and og at this point i'm just giving up on og like girl i cannot defend you anymore if you are just going to walk around this mansion being a tyrant to any and everybody also do you guys think cheray is now unfollowing kenya to get attention and then uh what's going on with the royal family are they racist or are they not okay historically speaking my

forget to create a great day bye you guys", "uKLN8-y1LuU": "Hey guys, it's Karina from Sis vs Bro. And today I'm making Ronald say yes to me for 24 hours! No! Why? I have loads of things planned for you to do. All right?\nPlanned? So you have like, a piece of paper and you write down, okay, so what is Ronald gonna do for me today? Yes! (laughs) So first thing I want you to do is clean my room, 'cause I didn't make my bed this morning so I need you to do that. So you did that on purpose? (laughs) Yeah! Just so I can do it? Okay fine, you know what? Fine, fine. All right! Go make my bed while I just sit here and relax on the couch. Why? Okay guys, so this is the way to Karina's dirty room which apparently, I have to clean. Okay, hopefully it's not that dirty. Okay, she just wants me to make her bed. I'm not gonna listen to that 'cause she didn't say to clean that up. I'm gonna make her bed 'cause she on purposely did not make it this morning. Let's do it. I'm not the best at this, so she might be disappointed. Oh, she just threw all this on the floor! Okay. (hitting pillow) (hitting pillow) (hitting pillow) (hitting pillow) (upbeat playful music) Okay, now her big bear. And, there you go. Okay, emoji right here. And a frog. Why does she have a frog? I don't know, okay. Maybe in front of her emoji, like that. Okay guys, so the bed is made. Hopefully Karina doesn't torture me again! What is that? Hopefully she doesn't ask me to clean that! Karina, your room is finished. Or, your bed is finished. Okay, well, I'm pretty hungry, can you make some lunch? Aren't you gonna go check it? No, that's fine. (video game jumping) Maybe I should check it. No, no, no, no, no! Okay, I'm gonna have to see what you did because I don't trust you. You left one of my shirts on the floor. It was always there. I asked you to clean up my room. Okay. I just made your bed, that's all. Okay, not bad. Not bad? I bet you cannot do better! Actually I bet you can. I can, but you know what, it's fine, so. Yes! Now I need you to make me some lunch 'cause I'm pretty hungry right now. I don't know how to cook! Just make a sandwich. With what? Hummus, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and cucumber. Why do I do these things? Okay guys, so we are in the kitchen and I forgot what Karina wants for her sandwich. Ronald, I want a sandwich with hummus, cucumber, avocado, tomato, and lettuce. Okay, avocado, tomato, lettuce, hummus, and cucumber. Why do I do these things? So guys, Karina wanted a sandwich. I have a bun here now let's put it in the hot stove. No! No! What? I put it like all the way to the end of it! Why did you do that? 'Cause I didn't want it, okay, I need. How are you supposed to get it out? Pray for my hands. (pounding heart beat) (victory trumpeting) Yes, yes! (oven slamming shut) So guys, the bread is cooking, and now, what do you want on your sandwich? Ronald, I said,\nI want hummus, avocado. Wait, wait, wait, let me guess. Okay, hummus, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and cucumber. Yes! You see, I have memory. And also add salt. Don't forget salt. Salt! Okay guys, so welcome to Ronald's not-so-professional cooking show. I'm just gonna use a cut board to make it more professional. Okay, so first we need a cut board to make Karina's sandwich. And then we need all our ingredients. But first we need our bread! This won't be too hard. There we go, we have a crusty bread. Okay, don't drop it. (oven slamming shut) (screaming) (beeping) (bread crunching) Is that what we do? (laughs) So the next step will be hummus. Okay, we're doing work. Okay, what do we need next? Avocado would be nice, right? Ronald, hurry up, you're taking a long time.\nCalm down! I'm hungry! This is a professional show, okay, don't hurry me. Avocado is finished. Just the finishing touch, there. Uh, small slices. You know what, I might like this. I'm bad at it, but I like it. Small slices. Okay, yes. Okay. Okay, how are we exactly gonna do this? Like the full slice? Oh, yeah! Ronald's cooking show has gotten an upgrade! (Ronald squeals) So guys, the second last step, the lettuce. (peaceful piano music) There we go! And the last step guys is the salt, don't forget the salt. You see, I remember things. Okay. (salt grinding) So guys, welcome to the magical land of Not-Ronald's-Slime, Ronald's Sandwich. (laughs) Now unfortunately, I don't get to eat. Okay, Karina, you're not gonna like this, but it still tastes good, so I feel good about myself. Okay. Dinner is served. Lunch.\nLunch, whatever. Lunch is served. Okay, thank you. All right, I'm gonna try this. So guys, so far this challenge is going really well, 'cause Ronald already cleaned my room and made me lunch, so I'm gonna try the sandwich that Ronald made. (bite crunching) Yes, it's good, it's good! Yes, you're dreaming, yes! Not enough hummus. I put lots of hummus! No, you didn't! Okay, maybe you bit in the un-hummus spot. I don't know. Can you get me some water, I'm pretty thirsty. Yes. There you go, missy. Do you like it? Mm hmm. Yes, yes! It's just water! No, I thought you meant the sandwich. Yeah, that was fine. I'm done, Ronald. Could you put my plate away? No, fine. Please help me! (peaceful calm music) Ronald, I think it's time for my foot massage. (dramatic music) What, are you kidding me? I don't want to do a foot massage! Ronald, you have to say yes! Fine. Eww. Eww, Karina, your socks are off, eww! Obviously, Ronald, you're massaging my feet, not my socks.\nOkay, I'm gonna start. (laughs) What are you doing? You have to massage my feet, not my toes. But your toes are safer. The feet's right there. (squealing) Ah, it's yellow. What? Guys, I'm washing my hands right after this. You're not even massaging, you're tapping. I'm pushing, okay. (beeping) Karina, what do you want now? We're in the same house, you know. Karina, why are you calling me? What do you need this time? I didn't want to get up and get you, so can you do my laundry? (whimpering) Fine! My laundry is in my bathroom. Oh no. Okay, so I have to wash it. I've never done the laundry before. Okay, so what do I do. So I just take this to the laundry room? Mm hmm, then turn on the washing machine. Okay, so I am in the torture we call the laundry room, and now it's time to do Karina's laundry. Oh no. So let's open up the washer and let's, sniff test. (sniffing) Eww! Go back, go into that laundry machine. I'm not even smelling the other ones. So guys, clothes are in. I have no clue how to work this machine, so I'm just gonna go. Ronald, I'm kinda hungry. Can you get me some kinda snack? (groaning) Fine! But you have to make sure that I like it, 'cause if I don't like it, you're gonna have to go back and get another one. Don't worry, I'll get you something you really like. Okay. (mischievous piano music) Okay, what does Karina like? Apples, I'll get her an apple. (mischievous piano music) There's your snack. Apple? Not an apple. You like apples! Yeah, but I don't want to eat something healthy now. (sighing) What do you want? I don't know, something that is not so healthy. Okay. Okay, so she doesn't want an apple. What else does she want, or what she wants? (mischievous piano music) Uh, (mischievous piano music) how about Pringles? How about that? Okay, here's your Pringles. Pringles? I don't really want Pringles. Are you kidding me? Just tell me what you want! I don't really want something salty, I kinda want something sweet. Okay, you're so picky. Guys, let's pray that she's gonna like these. Okay, the moment of truth. (pounding heart beat) Okay, do you like this? Crossing fingers. Oh, this is exactly what I wanted! Chocolate covered berries. Why didn't you just tell me that then? I didn't know we had these! Oh my goodness. Okay, at least you have it and I can go bye-bye. Okay. Wait, Ronald! What do you want this time? Uh, can you put the toothpaste on my tooth brush? What? (farting) Did you fart? (laughing) Yeah. Okay, at least this is like, easy, I guess. Karina you could just do it yourself, you know, you don't have to call me. But today you have to say yes, so I thought, why not? Okay, here you go. Thank you, Ronald. And now, I'm gonna leave. And make sure you don't fart in my room ever again! I will, don't worry. (electric humming) So guys, that was the end of the day, so that means Ronald is finally free. Yay, oh yeah! And make sure to comment down below and Instagram, if Karina has to say yes to me for 24 hours. Wait, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that! I really don't want to say yes to Ronald for 24 hours. But make sure you do 'cause our Instagram is right here. No, it's here.\nNow it's there. No, oh no, it's right there. Oh no, it's everywhere! So try to catch it before it flies away! We hope you (mumbles). Slap down that body and whip, see you all next time, good bye! (light peppy music)", "RyiVx3C5l4A": "(upbeat music) - Hey munchies, welcome to\nthe channel if you're new or if you're not I'm\nAlyssia and I'm stoked you're here either way. I have surprisingly\nhad a lot of people say can you do a video that\nshows healthy convenience store snacks, like gas stations snacks. I don't know why I'm surprised by this but I kind of thought gas stations and convenience stores\nhave a lot of options. So, I was confused about why\npeople really wanted this video and I started to think about it. I have some thoughts I'm gonna share. But my first thing I would\nadvise when asking yourself this question or asking anyone\nthis question, because you're on the hunt for healthy,\nconvenience source snacks is, why? So really knowing what is your goal and why are you gonna\nthe convenience store, is it because you're on the road? Are you just, you know, driving\nhome from school or what? So if you're on the road,\nwhich is usually when I go to a convenience store or gas station, that was kind of my\napproach to this video, is it because you're on Whole30\nand paleo that it's hard? Is it that you're trying to be healthy? Is it because you're\nafraid of eating bad foods? Are you experiencing some guilt or or are you judging yourself? You know, all of these kinds\nof change the intention behind why you want healthy\nconvenience store snacks and that intention will\nimpact your experience. So if this is a matter of you wanting healthy convenience store snacks\nbecause you're on the road, and any of those other things\nI just listed are true. My next question would be how frequently are you really on the road? Because if this is something\nlike for me, I don't, especially in coronavirus\ntimes, I don't travel a lot. There's not that many\nopportunities that I have to go into a convenience store and find a snack. So when I do, I kind of\nknow it's not forever. And do I really need to get\nso worked up over what it is. Again if I was doing Whole30\nor something, then yeah it would make sense, but you\nsee how this intention matters. So the truth is, it's\nactually not hard at all to find something healthy\nat a convenience store. And if you start with the fridge, that's gonna be your best bet for fresh, you know, regarding healthy. So whole fruit bananas, oranges, apples, you're almost always gonna find those. And in the actual refrigerator section they usually have like\nchopped, fresh fruit. I went to a 7-Eleven for this video and all the snacks I'm\ngonna show you today are from a 7-Eleven, but they\nhad, you know, chopped fruit that was mixed like the box I got here but they also had melons and grapes. They had some chopped salads and you know, a lot of times you can\nalso find like celery with peanut butter or boiled eggs. My store didn't have those but those are things\nyou can typically find in the refrigerator at a gas station. Uh cheese, I also found cheese and you know, prosciutto sticks and baby bells and that kind of stuff. That could be a great source of protein especially if you're\non the road and looking for something that will keep\nyou satisfied for longer. Now, here's what I realized\nas I started to contemplate why do people really want this video? So what's hard walking\ninto a convenience store is not finding something\nhealthy, it's deciding not to get something\nunhealthy, because we walk in and we're exposed to like a\nheaven of processed foods. It's just like so much stimulus. And I just want to eat\nall of these things. And why would I want to\npick up an apple when they have Doritos, you know,\nand all the good stuff. So I think the challenge\nis really mental, right? This is mind over munch. It keeps showing up every day. The challenge is walking\ninto the gas station and choosing something healthy. This is a valid concern and\nshould still be addressed. So if you feel like\nyou're forcing yourself to choose something that you don't want, it might be worth it to\njust pick the thing you want and give yourself permission to eat it. I did an entire video about the power of permission\nwith food last year and I'll link that below\nif that calls to you. If I go to a gas station and I need and I want or need to get a snack I'll first check in with my inner wisdom. If you don't know what\ninner wisdom is check out that video first so you\nknow what I'm talking about but essentially asking in,\ntuning in how hungry am I? Am I hungry? Am I just bored? You know, a lot of times\non road trips, I am bored. It's actually okay to\neat when you're bored and it's okay to eat junk\nfood because you feel like it. The question is what\nresonates with your body and heart and mind in\nthis moment considering the big picture of any health efforts you may be making or setting\nintentions around, right? So if you're like, well right now I'm doing Whole30 specifically to learn about what resonates with my body. Then yeah, it serves you\nto get really intentional. But if you're just like, ah I feel so guilty if I eat that food and it's coming from that\nplace of judgment, I would say take a step back and think\nabout why this matters to you. So after I check in with my inner wisdom then I can work out to the outer wisdom which is like the nutrition knowledge. So when it comes to outer\nwisdom, I personally will look more at ingredients\nof a snack these days in my life than I will\nthe macro nutrients. So the main thing I'll look\nat on the label is added sugar because added sugar provides\nno nutrition at all. Again, that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't or can't eat it. It's just, if I'm trying to\nmake a very intentional choice considering outer wisdom,\nI would personally look at added sugar, for instance,\nover calories or even fat. So throughout this video I'm gonna go through these snacks. The intention was choosing cleaner items. And by clean, I am defining\nclean as less processed, not good. This is not about, you\nknow, morality in food. I like the word clean because\nit just is a quick way to nod to being less processed. If you don't like the word you can replace it with whatever you like. I'm not saying, you know these foods are good in\nthese foods are bad, okay? So what else is there to eat\nat a convenience store besides fruit and cheese if you're\ntrying to make a healthy choice. Also from the fridge section,\nthese Sabra Snackers, okay? I love this. They're crunchy salty, satisfying. You get the protein from the hummus and you kind of get the\nprocessed food from the pretzel. So it's kind of like\nthe best of both worlds but you get a little bit\nof nutrition out of it. Oka, these kind of refrigerated smoothies, this is Mighty Mango Naked. This one, I just pretty much\nlooked in the refrigerator and this was the one\nthat had no added sugar. It does have, you know,\n68 grams of carbohydrates, 57 grams of sugar, but\nit's not added sugar. That being said it is a lot of fruit. I've joked about this\non the channel before when I did a video about\njuices and this has one and a quarter mangoes,\none and three quarters apples a half an orange, a\nthird of a banana, right? Like, would you eat\nthat much fruit at once? Probably not. That being said, it's\nstill a cleaner choice. So you do you. Okay, Pickled Bites. Yum, I've never seen these before. I was actually surprised how\nmuch healthy stuff they had at this 7-Eleven, but it's\nliterally just pickles. I think they're deal flavored\npickles in a bag, like that's awesome. Alright, so these were some\nlike fruit snacks that did not have added sugar into them. They were just the fruit. So these crispy apple chips, the only ingredient is apples, right? I might not want an apple on the road but if I want a crunchy, you\nknow, processed-like snack then here you go. Maybe that will satisfy you, maybe not. These Orchard Blend, Sweet Persimmon, Tart Apple and Tangy Peach dried chews. The only ingredients are\npeaches, apples, and persimmons. You can't get any\ncleaner than that really. So, and then this is apples fruit squeeze. It's not called apple sauce because actually it's\nnot just apples pureed, this is apple juice concentrate. So that is gonna have\na little bit more sugar but it's not added. So another great gas\nstation food is popcorn. So this is just, you know,\nregular sea salt popcorn. The only ingredient, popcorn,\nsunflower oil and sea salt. I don't know if this\none is air fried or not but you could always look for air fried if you're looking for lower and fat this one's probably not because\nthere's nine grams of fat. And then these Popcorner chips, only ingredients are yellow,\ncorn, sunflower oil and salt. And the White Cheddar Smartfood. I love this stuff so much. It's actually not as bad\nfor you as you might think. And I talked about this in\nmy healthy processed foods video or low, you know,\nI did a video last year about processed foods that\nhave minimal ingredients. So if that's what you're looking for, when you're looking at,\nyou know, gas station foods watch that video because\nI go through a lot of surprising processed\nfoods that have just a couple of ingredients. And this one I compare\nspecifically to, they have like, what is it a Smartfood 100 where it's like a hundred calorie Smartfood\npop compared to this one. And that one has way more ingredients. And it's actually not that\nmuch lower in calories. It's like nominal when you weigh it out. And I actually show you this side by side. While talking, you know, super processed, these are other ones that\nI've mentioned in the healthy processed or low\ningredient processed foods video. Pork rinds, okay? Pork rinds are almost always just gonna be fried pork skins and salt, right? Or, you know oil if they're fried. I don't personally love\nthe taste of pork rinds, but a lot of people do and\nit's actually a cleaner food. Chips, now Baked Lays\ndo have more ingredients but they have less fat\nbecause they're baked. These Lays only have\npotatoes, oil and salt. That's three ingredients. It could be worse, right? So like you have to decide\nwhat's worth it to you. And again, why are you, why\nare you getting this snack? Are you really just like wanting a crunchy delicious thing on the\nroad then why are you gonna force yourself\nto get the apple chips, when are these really\ndoing that much damage? I don't know. I would argue no. I would argue personally now\nmy feeling is the stress. I used to get so stressed\nout about this stuff. The stress that I would\nput my body and mind under, choosing something I didn't want because I was trying to be healthy, actually physiologically that\nstress did my body more damage than just eating the chips. That's me personally, okay? And then pretzels, pretzels are always. I love pretzels so much, you\nknow, it's a could be worse it's could be worse kind of food. Like they don't have too many ingredients. Yeah, it's white flour. It's enriched, but it could be worse. Nuts and seeds are another\ngreat choice that you can find at almost any convenience store. And if you are trying to be\npaleo or Whole30 or whatever, this is probably where you\nshould head to be safe. Watch out though,\nespecially if you're doing a strict elimination\ndiet like the Whole30. You can't eat peanuts for\ninstance, there are legumes, but most nuts are, a lot of\nnuts are fried in or roasted in peanut oil, so you have to check. And sometimes it'll say\nlike canola or peanut oil and you don't know which so\nit's not technically compliance. That gets really tricky. But for the most part,\nyou know, nuts are nuts. What I will say about the\nnut situation is if you go in shell or raw, it's\ngonna be your cleanest bet. Same goes for sunflower\nseeds in the shell. You can't get any cleaner than that. When it starts to come to flavoring, okay? So like these peanuts are salt and lime. The ingredients list gets longer. There's sugar and corn syrup,\nsolids and dextrose, right? And maltodextrin, whatever. There's more stuff in it\nis it the end of the world? If there is some stuff in your\npeanuts and you like them, lime flavored, that's up to you. Like me, I hate raw almonds. I will never eat a raw almond. It just tastes disgusting to me. These Wasabi Bold Almonds, I love these. They're so freaking good. They're not clean. They're not clean at\nall, but they're tasty. And really, you know, it's, I mean, they're not clean but they've\ngot one gram of added sugar. To have sugar is the main\nthing you're looking out for. You can still have a\ndelicious, crunchy snack where you know you're getting some nutrition. Uuhm these Love Corn. I don't know this brand,\nI've never had it before but any kind of like roasted\ncorn snack like this, the only ingredients are\nusually corn and oil and salt. This one also has habanero chili. One other thing I wanted\nto bring attention to was trail mixes, because\nthis is something else you can find at a gas station. And usually this is what trail, I guess trail mixes are technically\nlike for the trail, right? Like you go on a hike, you go on a trail and you've got this like mix\nthat'll keep you satisfied. Well, you know, on a car trip\nis sort of the same thing. If you don't have access\nto a food for a while, then a trail mix should\nkeep you satisfied. Here's the thing, you\nprobably already know this if you're watching this\nchannel, most trail mixes especially if they have\ndried fruit in them they have a lot of added sugar. This is so sneaky. Look at these two packages, which one looks healthier to you? Right, yeah, I mean, you\ndecide for yourself, but yeah this one looks like the branding\nmakes it look healthier. Like look at all these\nhealth claims, protein no artificial colors or\nflavors, no preservatives low sodium, blah, blah, blah. But then you look at the\nadded sugar of each of these. So this one just looks like\na regular old thing of, you know, nut and fruit mix. This one has one gram of added sugar and this one has eight. It's from the cranberries. Usually cranberries are\ngonna have added sugar. This one only has one gram\nof added sugar though. So I would actually pick this one and the ingredients are\njust as clean, right? So you have to read the label and don't go based on\nthe sneaky marketing. That being said maybe you\nwant really sweet cranberries in your trail mix, you know. Eating at a gas station is not forever. At least if you're going\non a road trip, I mean you're not gonna die from\neating some added sugar on your cranberries,\nor even from, you know picking the honey bun or the powdered sugar\ndonuts that I like to eat at a gas station, right? Like maybe when you're on a road trip this is the one time you get\nto indulge in eating some of those, you know, nostalgic\ngas station favorites, that you don't let\nyourself have very often or that you don't have the\nopportunity to have very often. So for me, giving myself permission in those contexts to say, no this is when I really want to\nhave the powdered sugar donuts and enjoy them fully. That's what works for me. The next go-to at a gas station or convenience store would be\nlike protein or meat snacks. So Jerkys is what a lot of people go for for a healthy snack. To be honest, the 7-Eleven I was at had no clean Jerkys at all. There are clean Jerkys now. Like it used to be you couldn't find a jerky without added sugar. You can find it now,\nbut not at my 7-Eleven. So these, are both, you know,\none has seven grams of sugar. The second ingredient is sugar. The Turkey Jerky has\nonly four grams of sugar but the second ingredient or maybe it's third\ningredient is still sugar. The Turkey Jerky has a really long a much longer ingredients list. So by the kind of arbitrary\nrule I gave you at the beginning of the video where I said, I\ngo by ingredients, you know and I look at sugar, whatever, I'm kind of breaking that rule because I would actually\npick this one over this. Why would I pick it? I like the way it tastes. I actually prefer the taste and texture of Turkey jerky, right? So this is the point you guys, there are no rules and any rule,\nhard and fast rules you set around food are only\ngonna make you miserable. They only made me miserable. I should speak from my\nexperience, huh, okay. These rules made me miserable and letting go of the rules\nthat like, I can only eat it if there's this much sugar\nor not, and this can't exist on the label or it has to\nbe this many, whatever. All that stuff drove me nuts. At the end of the day,\nit's one snack, okay? It's one snack on one car\ntrip, pick the one you want. This beef steak thing,\nthis looks so disgusting. I've never eaten one of these, but I had to get it\nbecause it was an option. So it's pretty much just\nas bad as the jerky. I mean, not as bad, it\nhas two grams of sugar but has a bunch of, Oh, it has MSG in it. Ooh, it's probably good. This Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip. I've never seen this or tried it before but I was impressed. It doesn't have any added sugar. The ingredients are\npretty clean and you know, it's a good option for a\nlow, moderately low calorie. It's a hundred calories,\nhigh protein, clean snack. You can also buy tuna at the gas station. Who knew 7-Eleven sold\nlike regular chunk tuna. Now this is not, I would\nsay this is probably not ideal to like get in\nyour car and eat this. Unless you have a, a can\nopener in the middle console, then it's not gonna be\nfeasible or easy to eat. But this little Wild Tuna\nMeal Kit, 7-Select brand which I think that's\n7-Eleven brand, right? It's, you know, pretty clean. I mean, it's got crackers. So, you know, if there's\nenriched flour in there, but this could be a good way to\nget a satisfying protein snack. They also of course have a whole\nlike aisle of protein bars. I haven't eaten protein\nbars in a couple of years but I was like, oh my gosh, there are so many protein\nbars now, most of them, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't eat them because I don't like the way they taste. Protein bars don't fill me up. But I wanted to at least\npick one up for the sake of the video, because of\ncourse it's an option, right? And depending on your health\ngoals and your food freedom it might be the right choice for you. I grabbed this. I don't actually like the way these tastes but they had the best,\nthe best ingredients. You know, it's like six\ningredients and it's pretty clean. Personally, I would\nprobably eat the baby bell or the cheese stick which\nhe gives me, two of these would give me as much protein in this. And it tastes way better. The other thing about protein bars, I said that they don't fill me up. They don't fill me up\nphysically, but also mentally. So a lot of times I eat them and I still feel like\nI haven't eaten food. So if I'm really hungry I wanna\neat something where my mind and body both know, okay, I ate. And if I'm wanting to eat a processed food and I'm just like, oh,\nthe protein bar kind of like satisfies the process, you\nknow, food itch or whatever. It doesn't for me anymore. It used to, now I want the real deal. I want, you know, the donuts\nor the chips or whatever. So I couldn't go into a gas station without buying a candy bar, right? So I have a Twix bar here and\nI also have this healthier Hu, Hu, Hu Get Back To Human Chocolate. So it's dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate. It's also organic, 70%\ncacao, vegan, paleo. I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm not a chocolate person. I like Twix bars, I like snicker bars, but not because I like chocolates 'cause of all the other good stuff in it. So, this would bring me no joy. Would it bring you joy? Maybe if you're someone\nwho likes dark chocolate, I would rather have the Twix bar. So again, intention here matters. If your intention is\ntrying to satisfy a deep desire to have a Snickers bar, right? This is probably not gonna do it. And this is why a lot of times\nwe can eat these substitutes and then still feel hungry or unsatisfied mentally and physically. But if you're just like, no,\nI really like dark chocolate and I really want a square\nof it to just, you know, have a little sweet after\nmy lunch or whatever then maybe it satisfies you. The only way to know is to\ntune into your inner wisdom. No one outside can tell you. Okay and the last snack is\nnot one I would recommend for if you want to eat\nhealthy at a convenience store but I saw them and I\ncouldn't not buy them. So I figured I'd buy it and taste it. These are pop tart bites. I couldn't resist. So there's 40 grams of sugar\nand 41 grams of added sugar. Oh my gosh, look so cute. Smell your food before you\neat it it'll taste better. There's your mindfulness tip. Oh my God, hmm. It tastes exactly like\nyou think it would taste. It's perfect, oh my gosh, that's so good. It's like a miniature\nPop-Tart that's almost better because there's a better\nratio of like icing, icing to cookie or pastry\nor whatever mixture than on a regular side Pop-Tart. Oh, these are so good. Not recommended if you're\ntrying to eat healthy at a convenience store, but\nI went to a convenience. I went to 7-Eleven and I saw them and I could not get them, so. So, that is the spread. I literally walked into a 7-Eleven. I was like, how many\nhealthy items can I get? This is what I found. I hope that it, you know,\nsupports your journey in some way. The goal was not for me to tell you these are the snacks to\nget, it was to help you really start to investigate\nwithin yourself. What are my intentions here, right? Like why does this matter to me? Just my own experience. I spent so much time, so many\nyears causing myself stress and distress around food and health and trying to make the right choice and then choosing what\nI didn't actually want because I thought I\nwas doing my body right and I was actually causing\nnot just like mental stress, but physiological stress\nin my body, dysregulation. I couldn't lose weight no\nmatter how many calories I ate because of that stress. So this is my mission here is\nto help you not stress so much about food and health, because so much of what we thought mattered\nreally doesn't matter that much, if our stress isn't under control.

cause they are just so boring and last season they went through this whole colorism thing with og and that brought them some ratings right so now it's like this season we have to live the aftermath of that and i just really can't stand og's attitude about the whole thing like oh gee i'm not talking about your your color i'm not talking about uh i'm not your teacher from back in the day honey but i do want to tell you that your head is really big and i think because you got all the support from social media that now you just feel so confident and you can take people down because you feel as though you took evelyn down but let me tell you a lot of people been waiting to take evelyn down a lot of people have been waiting to speak against her okay especially coming off the gym thing and especially coming off the patting on herself and all that we wanted to cancel evelyn so don't take that the energy that we gave you you know that smoke that we gave you and then try to come into the season acting like you you you the queen of cancer because you're not okay that was the internet and now you have to go back to the castmates and kind of explain what you meant you know and yeah i do feel like there is some colorism in the group but at the end of the day honey that's not a black woman in that group and all black people experience colorism and when you're trying to explain yourself it seems like you're just digging a bigger hole for yourself because oh everyone has offended me a lot of times when you say that everyone has offended you it's something that you are doing sometimes you have to look into the mirror and i do believe that you have a aggressive attitude and these new girls in this group yeah i heard something about you did speak with one of them maybe before through social media you know about phoebe or the land situation we all know that there is you know a prior build up before you guys come on to but you are running these girls away already and it's like girlfriend you're gonna be separated again at the reunion if you keep talking like that because i wouldn't want to sit next to you because you have so much hate not hey you have so much um so many feelings built up from your childhood and you just spew an amount of other people in your adulthood and that's not gonna work especially on tv when we can see the [ __ ] like you your hair's gonna be in a therapy session next now let's get on this phoebe situation this phoebe situation i mean girl you finally get a little piece of a storyline and you just feeling like oh you risk your life for me and this girl you know how does basketball wife stuff go okay somebody gonna come your antagonizers are gonna come on the show so they can pick a beef with you so stop acting like you are somebody they using it for a storyline what you really just witnessed is that evelyn shawnee jackie well jackie you know she's not your friend but it's all a setup honey they knew it was coming so then they surprised you with it so and thank god you wasn't there because you probably would have embarrassed yourself then secondly i want to go back to the part where you said um you came in contact with somebody who had corona right you you said no evelyn said was there kissing involved and he was like oh no we didn't kiss but you never say really if it was a male or a female so were you really in contact with somebody who had covey i don't know why would you lie about that i don't know but at this point i'm thinking that you probably lied about that so you can avoid being in a house with a girl expose your business let's think about that that's it that would have been a good episode girl you miss your chance you stupid girl can't stand phoebe and what happened to her rapid career she's trying to challenge tammy tammy who out here doing her making all that money while you about to get your butt handed to you on the season of bbw so um i guess i'll just park in and wait till next week and see if they spice up my life or see if they get this situation right with og because i'm sick of the storyline everybody didn't win so black lives matter so activists and all this in these um in these seasons because of what was happening in in early 2020 and i'm just uh just give me some tv okay i want some tv we didn't live through that struggle already i don't want to see it again and they're doing it for reason it's killing me okay so let's get back to some trash tv let's get phoebe in that room with that girl and get down and dirty y'all make sure y'all like comment and subscribe and i'll see y'all later", "xMX7eTfBRHU": "all right guys we got some new action cardi b versus candace owens round like 50. i don't know if you guys have been following but there was just a twitter exchange between candace and cardi following cardi b's disgusting grammys stripper set i don't know what we're calling it candace and her exchange some words on twitter we're gonna cover all the action pick your fighter are you on the side of candace owen self-made lovely free thinker or you're on the side of cardi b former stripper prostitute can't spell choice is yours this episode is brought to you by flekus talks the store shopflekis.com i'm rocking the og pink fleck as hoodie if you know you know if you don't catch up all right let's get into it so the whole thing started with this tweet right here it says candace owen says [ __ ] a acronym i'm not going to define in the show being performed at the grammys signifies the corrosion and end of an empire makes sense sounds about right so then cardi said yay we made it on fox guys [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and keep in mind [ __ ] is wet ass i thought you weren't gonna tell people i'm gonna censor it after which you can't even say in the song so on tv she wasn't even able to sing her own song because the title of the song has an obscenity in it and some people are coming in saying like oh this is her embracing her sexuality nothing wrong with this it's not embracing sexuality when you're on national tv prime time on cbs doing porn basically right that's not embracing anything so candace replies just at me next time directly you are cancer cell the culture young black girls are having their minds poisoned by what you are trying to package and sell to them as empowerment i'm one of the few who has the courage to tell you the truth you should thank me and instead of thanking her cardi b who can't spell like we said decides to engage in a little bit of twitter beef so let's see what happens cardi b replied was something that she i guess deleted since then and candace replied to that saying the reason my comments always get you and your feelings is because deep down you know what i'm saying is true you are in a position to empower young women to aspire to something more than taking off their clothes but you don't feel you can be more this whole argument is made political but it really shouldn't be it isn't political it's just truth versus deception truth versus lies candace isn't candace in this case is speaking the truth the seller of the lies in this case is cardi b and also the media look at cnn look what they wrote about it cnn said cardi b and megan the stallion served up a very sex-positive performance that's who's selling the lies that and what do those lies cost your soul and is anyone going to correct cardi b is cardi b's family going to stop the money from coming in and the new life they have no where's cardi b's brother during this and my sister wouldn't be dancing on stage doing any sort of [ __ ] thing but i guess if my sister gave me a bentley she could do whatever she wants maybe that's what i think cardi b's family's doing i think that's what's going on so cardi b responds matter of fact i'm just gonna thank you candy she put my performance on fox news giving it more views that boosted the views on youtube and is counting towards my streams and sales stream up and [ __ ] remember grown parents only you can monitor what your kids watch no one else except when it's on cbs like if you make the video yourself and you put it online for sale or whatever fine this is cbs prime time like a few years ago there were actually some restrictions on like what kind of things were allowed and they had to always like check in they had us they had a standard that just doesn't exist anymore so candace replies i don't work for fox news bill collis buckhollas is cardi b's real name cardi b is calling her candy candace is calling cardi b belcalis nor do i take issue with you having success i take issue with you being used to encourage young women to strip themselves of dignity men typically treat women how they treat themselves you know that which is absolutely true we saw that with offset cardi b's husband or whatever i don't think it's husband but off said she done cardi b a bunch and she took him back he's trash she's trash she doesn't respect herself he doesn't respect her and that's what happens you live a trash life kind of how it works and i think the problem with feminism too where it used to be like women had high standards and brought men up to their standards but feminism was like you're a man you do whatever you want men do it and then that brought women down and they started doing groceries like us and now the society has to pay for it moving on very fair so cardi b replies with a picture of melania trump i guess and some like kind of like a skimpier outfit and like from her modeling days uh which the tweet was once again deleted uh and candace replied to that saying what is your obsession with the trump family you were digging up modeling shots of our former first lady from three decades ago she has evolved you have not what you did at the grammys was disgusting own it which is 100 true cardi b constantly is trying to find things that like she selectively remembers that help her argument but then she won't take the issue head-on of like what you did the grammys was gross and that's just like the back and forth we were seeing here pretty much the entire time so cardi b replies um about melania trump saying i'm i'm obsessed she's my idol she showed me i can be naked perform [ __ ] and still be first lady one day wait so only white women can be naked and show their sexuality and evolve in their 30s but i can't wow america's so unfair to think this is the land of the free canis replies you are insecure and i irk you because i see right through the facade you are part of the larger cancer that is manifesting in black culture there's no person in america who can look you in the face and honestly say they wish their daughters turned out like you absolute headshot absolute drag absolute headshot and it's that's just it find me the guy find me a guy do you want your daughter to be like cardi b let me know in the comments i'll pin it and like all this wouldn't really be an issue if cardi b was a normal performer who was kind of raunchy and like lived in her own world that way cardi b's being promoted by the entire music establishment the entire media she's being propped up she was a billboard 2020 woman of the year the former hooker prostitute who like drugged and robbed people and admitted it that's the woman of the year yeah that's the problem that's the problem let's keep it moving let's keep it moving let's get upset let's keep it moving and then cardi b replied and black women should be more like you after all the fighting for equality and freedom they should be submissive to a white man after years of abuse and rape making them a sandwich while pregnant because in your words that's what a woman should do interesting and she showed a video of candace making her husband a sandwich and saying that's what woman should do which you know i'm fine with that the world would have you think women shouldn't be taking care of their families and cooking and at home and doing what you know doing that if that's what they choose to do the world will have you think that cardi b and megan stallion or whatever on stage is like acceptable cbs is gonna show it to you cnn's gonna tell you it's great so it's like those are the two options those are the two worlds i don't like the world if the if not living for the world is having a family and a wife who like likes to make you sandwiches and you don't have to go outside and deal with all like the hookers and stuff i mean that don't sound so bad then kenneth says making my husband a sandwich is not submissive cooking for your family is not submissive yes a good woman should take care of her family and yes a good man does the same my relationship is healthy you can't stay the same so maybe take some notes which is true okay this followed up with if you think making your husband a sandwich is a sin by popping your vagina into another woman's vagina in front of the world in front of the world is power you are a lost soul which is basically what this whole thing comes down to cardi b is a lost soul she's a puppet she got paid money she doesn't know what she's doing and she's promoting things that are subverting the what's best for this country like subverting american values subverting traditional values and it's like creating this toxic world where like women are going to grow up and have this bad image of what good is and it's really going to ripple badly in our society if you don't call it out that's how i see it rap boy do you agree don't bring me into this but yes i agree rap i don't want to come into this one so then canis replied again uh to the original sandwich tweet about her husband um from cardi b saying you always love to mention my husband's skin tone so let me ask what color are the people that are encouraging you to strip in front of the world who owns your record labels who owns cbs and the grammys who makes the most money off of your [ __ ] you sold it to who so then cardi b says as a black woman you should know better than that you know dm d-e-u-m for damn when we said she can't spell and she's not literate we weren't just saying that dume i'm gonna read it how she meant it so as a black woman you should know better than that you know damn well america made a caricature of a black woman only being good in the kitchen and taking care of children also known as the mammy okay so if you're saying because candace owens is supportive of her family and provides for them and cooks for them that she's a sellout and she's a mammy and that's her caricature was your caricature cardi b some sort of yelling prostitute yeah some sort of shouting former prostitute being used by the elites to enact a satanic agenda i don't know and then candace replied with buchalas i will literally make my husband a sandwich every single day of the week you're struggling right now to change the topic because you're ashamed of your performance and you should be you look foolish trying to make your onstage lesbian simulation about a sandwich once again cardi b can't take the issue head on diverting to here diverting to here cardi b replies candy stop blaming my label for me being sexual before i got signed to a label i was very much open to my sexuality you knew i was a stripper you watched me in love in hip-hop you knew all that other stuff yet you still endorsed me in this tweet you did case close case it's not closed it's an old tweet where candace said that her cardi b and denzel could be people that are like freedom-minded and woke and could become like red-pilled this was years ago obviously didn't pan out and then candace replied you're all over the place trying to make people look at anything but the issue at hand your performance was grotesque this is not about love and hip hop this is not about my husband's sandwich this is about you and the vulgarity that you espouse that is ruinous to our youth ruin us ruin us to our youth you think cardi b is doing like dictionary.com in between some of these tweets like during the beef i don't think cardi b can esp so vulgarity that you espouse that is ruinous to our youth espouse that is ruinous to our youth cardi b is like what this mean with her nails and she's probably like typing oh man so then cardi b replies saying how candace basically like endorsed her at one point so that means she endorsed her forever and candace replies with every time you and i get into a twitter exchange you keep bringing up this tweet so let me reiterate i still think you have potential you are entertaining and funny but you are not being that anymore you have transformed into a stain on culture and what it means to be a woman so it's like saying you're funny you have potential there's a redemption arc it's not a cancellation it's not oh let's get rid of cardi b she's horrible let's put her on the shelf forever and forget about her stuff and delete her music that's what the left does there's a redemption arc here saying you have potential you have a huge responsibility you have a huge platform millions of girls look up to you do the right thing or at least like get on the track to do the right thing and know that you need to do the right thing by them cardi don't think like that yup so candace replied to that with millions of young girls follow you at your best you are self-deprecating and humorous at your worst you are naked and shoving your vagina into other women's vaginas while thrusting on top of her you were at your worst on the grammy stage do better so here's the reply from cardi b which is the ultimate diversion we're saying how she's diverting all night this is the ultimate diversion and it's the ultimate double down in a bad direction so cardi b says not you talking about two women thrusting their vaginas together while your husband and brother slap [ __ ] and together well would you look at that and she tags a photoshop tweet of candace allegedly saying yes my husband did cheat on me with my brother yes he said no when i asked to join them so like clearly it's a photoshopped fake tweet but i don't know is cardi b just like the stupidest person or is the person in the room with her just an idiot too they went for it they fully went for it which you'll see gets a little tricky when it comes to legal stuff too but if you look closely you can see uh the tweet says view tweet activity which you would only see on your twitter for your tweets and is underneath candace's tweet so the fact that it says view tweet activity shows us that it's a photoshop tweet and the person did a bad job because they selected one of their own tweets to copy model wise so candace says i'm literally laughing out loud cardi my dear that is clearly a photoshop tweet only one of us has a husband who sleeps around another head shot the body's just a mess on the floor right now we're gonna need someone to clean this up so then cardi replies with this isn't a photoshop tweet you were trending the whole day when you tweeted this it was published on a lot of blog outlets your right mind sleeps around you're right mindlessly it's hard to read when you do the grammar isn't right because you read like a normal person and then you don't know what people are saying and you have to read like a dummy to understand how cardi b thinks sometimes so you're right mine sleeps around and yours sleeps at yours at your sleep at your home with your brother boxing while you tweet me cardi please and then candace replies what in the actual hell are you talking about are you dead serious right now trying to substantiate a photoshop tweet asking one more time before i get the lawyers to make you probably publicly admit you're lying and embarrass yourself which is the action i like to see i love when the lawyers get involved just not against me so the final tweet of the exchange canis replied to someone who said just sue her already uh candace said yes just spoke with my family i am 100 suing cardi for that nonsense you can't just start throwing out wild lies against private members of my family because you're upset someone called you out for your degenerate performance i'll keep you all posted and it's like if you're wondering where the line is who's right who's wrong obviously it's candace is correct but if you really wanted to think it out imagine there's like a 13 year old girl at home watching is this good or bad for her to see is this good for society or bad for society is this helpful and pushing us in a good direction or is this degenerate knocking us further from god we all know the answer to that so all in all really good action really good twitter beef candace once again wins cardi will never really beat candace in a twitter fight because the truth is on candace's side and that's really what this is a battle of so 4.25 out of 5 stars on the flecca scale let me know what you guys think in the

all the good stuff thank you richard rap boy for joining me as always we'll see you guys at the next one that was a good episode are you done you done", "u3uhTb-Chdg": "hi guys welcome to the m1 show now today this is like a kind of education on sneakers and i guess the world of trainers because a lot of times i get asked questions what does this word mean for example what does the sneaker head mean what does ds mean what is it what is a retailer all these kind of questions here and there and even though some of them are kind of self-explanatory i understand why you might not know the definition so today guys i decided to do a video on 15 words every person should know if they want to become a sneaker so um with that being said guys make sure you like comment and subscribe and if you like this video let me know we might make it into series but yeah let's get into this one [Music] okay guys so the first word on my list here is ugly now if you guys know about phineas and feb you know about the song a g l e t agreed don't forget but some of you still don't know where the ugly is so i'm going to show you i'm going to make this one visual for you guys yeah cool so today we have my drawing 6 infrareds these are the 2019 versions i believe the 2018 yeah 2019 yeah 2019 versions yeah so an aggregate is this plastic tip that is found in the laces in plastic with some changes might be metal um and yeah so that i know a pair of jordan 4's that have them as like a stainless steel sort of metal thing but these are plastic and these protect your um lace tips from actually splitting and becoming difficult to put through your lace holes obviously self-explanatory placeholders yeah you know you know what that is but yeah ugly first time on the list so term number two b tech b tech um usually used to refer to resellers who are quite inexperienced they're quite young in the game of retail and they don't really know how to hustle and if you happen to come across them and you know your stuff you can definitely get a good deal out of them so yeah btech can be used for that term it can also be used for trainers so some people when the mockers were first rumored people were saying that the mocker jordan ones were a b-tech version of the travis jordan one some people might agree something might disagree it's it's really depends on what side you're on but i think the mic is a great shoe so i don't necessarily see them as a b-tech version but i can see why people think that sometimes so yeah term number three beta so a beta is a sneaker that you pretty much wear every day whatever then you should go to your shoe um and you don't mind getting them dirty so at the moment these are my pieces guys so these are my beauty sneakers um yeah they've seen better days i wear them to work all the time um sometimes when they're going shop maybe i'm going back to the gym or something i went to the gym but yeah these are my beer sneakers i might even get a new person i was looking at some new balances that look kind of hard um but yeah bs sneakers are just everyday sneakers you don't really care where you're wearing them to they they're not really too um fashionable sometimes they can just be pairs that you like and you wear them every day so you have to be a sneaker number four colorway now i know you guys see my unboxing videos you always hear me say university blue colorway infrared colorway anthracite colorway but essentially what colorway is is a combination of colors used to differentiate the styles that's simple it's not really a difficult thing to pick up when you have a colorway it's the identity of the sheet the color it makes the sheet because the silhouette obviously is the shape of the shoe the colorway is the color of the shoe and that's what gives the shoes title typically so for example these university blue colorway nice simple it was the color of the shoe that defined the shoe and then it was a jordan so jordan one university that's kind of the identity of the shoe like um like a possible you know you have your first name then you have your last name you have the date of birth for this things that's kind of how it kind of works for shoes as well so yeah cool number five dead stock now denzel is the term that's evolved throughout the years but it generally means a shoe that is 100 new and it comes with its box so for example how many desktop changes i have here right now i have a couple i have a couple all right cool so guys this is an example of deadclock trainers now i know the paper is crinkled but that is just naturally opens and closed in the box i can't really do much about that however i have never worn these shoes out this box is here and the shoe is in great condition perfect conditioning in fact like it's on one two it's almost to the extent like it's better than one i just tried it on and that was about it but if i was to sell these i would sell them as the s trainers which is dead stock so whenever you see somebody say diaz that's dead stock if somebody says vnds that means very near that's a very nearly dead store so that's basically like when they sell you a shoe and they're like oh i mean it's basically brand new but it's not exactly brand new to get it so that's that's the nds whereas ds is dead stock purely fresh unworn yeah next term fnf fnf it means friends and family so we all know designers make shoes for example we see travis scott making the shoes and traffic isn't necessarily a designer but he has definitely got a strong hold on the game right now so nike are giving him whatever she wants to put the traffic effect on the traffic effect being that whatever she travis touches turns to literal gold does she will drop come out somebody will buy it they should not go for a thousand plus crazy absolutely not but there's a travis effect and that's simple so travis has for example a pair of friends and family jordan 4's they're purple these shoes are hard but they're only given to friends and family who travis scott has selected for them to go to again we also have um dj khaled with his friends and family shoes again he has multiple there are so many designers and people that have worked in that have multiple friends and family pairs of shoes even with mx mx month happening yeah the ms masters they had the original version that they released in but they also had a friends and family version and um the friends of the family will go out to a list of people whether that be chosen by the creator side of the shoe or chosen by night they'll go out to individuals who who they believe deserve the shoe or are close enough to them to get a shoe so yeah that's friends and family then full size run fsr now you might see like somebody post that's the source player post full size running like what the heck does that mean full size run is very simple it just means that the size is going to range from kid sizes all the way to adult sizes that could be as far as toddler sizes to about size 11 12 maybe and that is a full size run in all sizes as it kind of makes sense it's very self-centered so yeah pretty simple one really um then next up you've got gr gr is general release so general release is a shoe that's been mass-produced and is available at most retailer retailers it doesn't typically sell out but sometimes it does there's been a lot of gr air forces that have touched the streets and somehow sold out so far it's a bit more difficult to explain these days how gr's work especially with the rise of resellers but more or less is a shoe that drops for example a typical gr is like a nike react um that is a that is a gi shoe at the moment that correct vision i believe that she dropped came out um obviously it's out in most retailers and it's just they're chilling like it doesn't sell out it just gets constantly stocked and people constantly buy this general release nice and simple so number nine guys we've got grail now grail is a sneaker or a train you've been trying to buy for years and um this is a pair you're currently striving for so these definitions are getting all from kitchener so shout out to them because this list is very competitive but yeah yeah see grail cradle fam my girl at the moment that i've got a couple i've got the jordan 4 um cause in grey beautiful shoe i need that but expensive expensive all my days second shoe jordan one rust pink peek press peak but there's a gray or shoe when i eventually get rich and i get that shoe y'all know about it everybody will know about it even mama charlie will know about it bro third one i want to say the court purple 2018's for me personally an amazing shoe ever since i saw that she um i think i saw lance you feel wearing the shoe don't watch the rams i'm just it's just the accident but i saw that seafood wearing the shoe and it just looked amazing honestly it just looked amazing ever since then and as i learned more about the quality of the shoe and how much like black just how great the shoe is i just need that shoe that shoes around like i want to say five six pills right now i need that shoe that's so i'm putting my bad penis actually i don't know how i'm gonna get it i'm gonna get and you guys will know about it again yeah and then obviously holy grail is then like the grill or grails like it's like everybody has a common consensus that this shoe is amazing so there's grails then there's holy grails that make sense so yeah now we're going to get into the next term number 10 hypebeast hypebeast is a term used to describe a sneaker who doesn't own their taste so then they're like they buy shoes because everybody else buys them they don't buy shoes because they like the sheet they buy shoes because oh do you know what if i grab that shoe everybody will love me if i grab that shoe everyone else is bad at you a good example of that is the royal toy jordan ones a lot of people grab those shoes because they don't necessarily like the shoe but twitter hacked up yeah but obviously everybody has their own reasons buying shoes at the end of the day in it but obviously some people just bought it because it was in hype in fashion they could take pictures which is cool you can do that to you like it doesn't take away from you being a sneaker or person that likes trainers it's just that everyone's everyone's reason for buying the shoe is different so some people buy it because they love the shoe other people buy it because they love the hat that comes with the sheet and just have to kind of know what side you're on and be firm in your side and if you want to switch that that's cool too but yeah then le limited edition now this one i like recently only because i've been seeing ellie and s e on shoes and i didn't really understand what it meant i just kind of if i liked the shoe i'd get invested in the shoe and buy the shoe but usually i didn't really pay attention to it but limited edition is a shoe that's produced simply in limited quantities and exclusively available at select retailers so for example there's been foot patrol collapse where it's only been available that she's not even available at foot patrol or for example some puma rsx's that my brother owns um they were foot locker exclusive so early foot locker got that shoe in that colorway even though the shoe as a silhouette came out everywhere else it only came out in that colorway at full look on that's an example of limited edition um the other version of the ellie is essie so that's special edition so that could be like to celebrate an event for example um the all-star game happened recently um and some special edition shoes dropped for that the s there would be title or something something s e for example yeah then og so og is a word obviously you've heard a lot of times og isn't a new term it's not a term that is a foreign people people might urge you to describe their orders people might use og subscribe people that have been doing stuff longer than them and so for example you can have og sneaker heads they're much older than us they've seen so many more silhouettes than us they've collected so many more shoes than us and because of that you regard them as an og in the game so you can also get og shoes og shoes refer to shoes that originally came out back when the brand first started and so for example this this fiery journal forum holding was an urgent colorway um it was the first four colorways of the jordan 4. so that was the fire red the military blue the black cement and the bread those are the four o.g colorways that came out of jordan ford's um and so yeah when you hear people say oh geez just reverse the original colorway rather than anything else that you might be thinking it was so yeah all right cool 13. so yeah guys i kind of lost count so i wasn't really counting as i was going but i'm on number 30 right now so next time prm prm is simple just means premium it's a term you subscribe night trainers are made with premium material so when you see me say tt material 10 out of 10 that's probably premium material when i say premium level it's quality level it's not that level that you get on your small boys shoes it's whatever that you get on some shoes at night don't last your respect and they just try and give them a poke of this level this is prm quality quality control i'm giving you some examples of prx shoes so yeah y'all can see that i don't even know where this american accent came from i just got a bit bored but yeah that's what premium means premium is prm so you see air force one prm premium quality shear which means that the quality of the shoe is good and you'll get your money's worth basically cool number 14 retro now for example deja jordan 11 concordes these got released multiple times over the past um i wouldn't say 10 years i think it's been at least twice maybe maybe one more maybe three times but i think it's twice over the past ten years and um basically retro is literally a trainer that's been released so when the trainer comes out the first time access to og version then this is retro og and so they just keep retro retro in the shoe i'm bringing it out so for example this year we saw the 85 jordan 1 neutral gray unfortunately i didn't get that shoe but it was an amazing shoe and that's actually the first time that she's been retro since his original form came out in 1980 five i think could be wrong but that's the first time we've seen that shoe get um retro since his original form came out so um yeah like when you see shoes come out and they say retro it just means that they've had their original before and they're coming out again you know night for that shoot bang so much we're going to spin that book again and that's simply what it is literally and then yeah sp so this is number 15 guys so we have you know we kind of went to three is kind of quick to be honest but number 15. sb sb means skateboarding and it is a subdivision of nike from the early 2000s that focuses on skateboarding basically so when you see sp dunk that's not the same as a normal dunk it's not the same as a gr dunk that they are sb dunks focused on skateboarders and that kind of skateboarding community so they tend to have a thicker tongue they tend to be better quality material than the typical dunk that comes out even though last year the doctor came out had very good quality on them but the sv dunk store tend to be consistently good quality all the time whereas this year we've seen a drop in the quality of dunks at the moment so yeah just so you guys can kind of get an understanding of things like that so guys those are the 15 terms you need to know if you want to become a sneaker and finally guys a bonus one what is a sneakerhead a sneakerhead is a person that enthusiastic about trainers they love trainers live on blue trainers tend to collect trainers they might trade trainers to get better ones that they wanted or trade to get other ones that they were kind of looking for um and they tend to know a lot of information about trainers typically they they know their stuff like if you ask them certain questions about shoes they will answer you in a few minutes just like that and yeah guys we've come to end the video i hope you guys have learned something um and even though this is a bit different for me i feel like as a person that kind of knows about trainers and enjoys like collecting sneakers as it were it's kind of it's sort of my responsibility to teach other people why i love training so much and to understand about trainers more and more so that's why i kind of decided to do this video again a bit different but if you enjoyed it then it's great let me know in the comments guys if you learned a new word let me know in the comments if you enjoyed this video i might even make this into a little series and just do like how to become a sneaker kind of thing and give you guys little tips and pieces on how to actually learn how to become a sneaker to learn new things but with that being said guys make sure you like

met this girl in a subway walking my way it must have been my day seemed like the perfect match for me so she said to me craig can you give me what i want i don't know about you what is up i am crypto mason welcome to the greatest crypto channel on youtube we only do it big over here i want to thank you all for the uh growth on the channel we're almost at 10 000 subscribers i know in no time we will be at a hundred thousand um and everybody will be able to get the best information ever now what is this video about this video is about a hidden gem project that i have just found and i need to let you guys know about it so in this video we are going to learn all about this hidden gem project we're going to learn about their token model as you can see at the bottom of the video this video is broken up into sections i hope it is if i remember but we're going to cover their token model we're going to cover their entire website all of their partners which they have some notable partners um we're going to cover who's on their team and we're going to connect it with some other cryptos some other cryptos uh that we love so the title of the project let's get to it this is planet watch now before you go and try to buy it it's not out it's not out yet um that is what i found it is not even out yet but we're gonna go over this i believe this is a very very hidden gem right here let's start off with where did i find this project i found this project on linkedin now definitely go check me out on linkedin we can have a little connection on there they don't call it follow or you could just follow me but let's uh look at this so this project is heavily connected to algorand it's actually a utility token issued on the algorand blockchain so when i saw that i love al goran by the way i love love al grand um like i i think it's an absolute tech tech giant right there um planet watch launching their planet token a utility token issued on the algorand blockchain this is very exciting news and it is fantastic to see projects projects uh building economies on algorithm let me give them a follow i didn't even follow them oh and then i clicked on it and it says great news planet watchers the planet watch token model will be published on march 11 at 7 pm so that's already out because it's march 18 right now and i noticed they only have 389 followers um so now we know kind of what it is just a very general it's a utility token issued on the al grand blockchain then i went to their twitter and they only have 1 200 followers so it's very small very small already it says planetwatch decentralizes incentivizes and gamifies air quality monitoring your planet needs you so this is one of them green projects from green energy projects and i'm going to show you um some more let's get into their website now so it says air quality affects your health look after the air you breathe earn rewards and help us build a global air quality monitoring network to detect pollution hotspots and protect everyone's health so basically this is kind of like helium mining um if you were in the og discord server um you would have seen that we were talking about helium mining and actually i have an old video where i looked at helium um as the token as the token so this is like i'm gonna get into it in a second but let's keep going down on their website right um yeah we just got cern right here do you guys know what cern is you guys know what cern is cern is absolutely so this is called cern spin-off actually basically spin-off cern spin-off what that means a new spin-off policy to promote certain technologies so basically you can like you can like work with cern basically um and you're like a spin-off company who qualifies for technical support and you get access to equipment infrastructure um so basically you're like working with cern you're working with cern if you guys don't know what cern is hold up not cern png go here cern is this right here they're the ones like who people think are gonna like blow up the universe with like an a nuclear something the european uh organization for nuclear research that's the logo hold up yeah that's the logo all i see is a lot of sixes but we'll move on um cern's main site this is in switzerland right here okay they've got all this stuff hydron colliders particle accelerators it's crazy stuff so guess what cern has outside of their outside of their building they have a giant statue of shiva they have a giant statue of shiva you can see these all these people outside they have a giant statue of shiva and shiva if we go and look shiva is a god look right here um one of the principal deities of hinduism is the supreme being um and it's it's the uh god of destruction god of destruction meditation yoga time and dance the destroyer of evil so very interesting that they would put this outside of their their building um but let's go back to here so cern is working or planet watch is working is a spin-off of cern then they list algorand right here of invest horizon they've got three algorands listed right there foundation and europe accelerator so basically what you can do with this is you can buy a sensor right here if you go to products you can buy these sensors and put them in your house or outdoor and you'll actually start earning planet token that's the token that's launching is called planet um so you can get one of these i swear i might get one i want this one though the indoor i want the indoor because background mode only with an android device i don't have an android so let's keep covering the website why planet watch air pollution kills seven million people every year worldwide what really i think that's bs but okay because there are too few air quality sensors on the ground many dangerous pollution hot spots are not detected by deploying more sensors we will be able to understand pollution dynamics and suggest more blah blah blah blah so basically you you put the sensor and you just earn tokens for for it just working you just earn planet tokens um so here's they list some bs scenarios very good this is i love this i love when you can do something like this and merge it with cryptocurrency so you've got the atmo tube that's a weird ass name atmotube pro and this gives you 0.02 planets slash measure i don't know what that means default streaming frequency every two minutes connectivity bluetooth so you can get that one or you can get the ariana now i haven't ordered one of these yet because i i don't know i might wait for this one they're still haven't released it but you get 0.07 planets per measure per measure so they've got an app on your phone as well for to to link up with the um to link up with the i'll keep wanting to call it a miner it's a sensor so and basically you're giving them you're they're you're giving them error data from where you are that's all you're giving them like that sensor is in your house and it's sensing the air pollution quality and it's sending it to them and you're getting paid for that data basically so take a look at their team right here right we've got daario which is um where is he dario de la liglio and i look i click on his thing and i see he's at oracle or he was at oracle for 10 years and 10 months now if we go to quant if we go to quant because these all link i'm basing my whole basically my whole thing is based off the iso 2022 and this circle of like interesting companies so we go to quant right we go to their partners and we see oracle oracle is there as a partner on the quant also amazon so that that is interesting that that this guy used to work at oracle and now he's on the team for planet watch and then we've got claudio which is the main guy up here the ceo and founder wow ceo and founder of this he used to be at cern five years and eight months he was at cern head of knowledge and technology transfer so he's a smart guy so he was at cern that's so crazy what did he move on terribly unico looks like a bunch of failed stuff honestly um but now he's with the with the algorithm boys and he's making planet watch so they've got advisors right there al goran mentor they've got their press listings which every coin has these nothing special let's get into their token model um this just released on march 11. the token is not out yet it's not out yet so don't be asking me where can i buy this um also don't buy everything i say don't when you hear me mention a coin do not buy it you will get wrecked if you just buy every coin i mentioned i am full spectrum i'm here for all of crypto so which means i can i i talk about every crypto my portfolio was logged on youtube it's logged at that certain time you could see what i hope what i held so here's their token model document cern spinoff they list it first right there um okay let's go down so we already know it's a utility token on the algorand blockchain the name of the token is planet and the maximum token supply is 4.5 billion 4.5 billion i really really like that as a i really like that as a max supply as we know ripple or i mean xrp is a hundred billion um okay so this and look look why they did that this figure was chosen as it corresponds to the estimated age in years of the earth that's so dope i like that all tokens have been minted at the start of the project a number of tokens corresponding to five percent of the maximum token supply was given to planet watch the remainder of the tokens are being released over time and allocated to reward data streams this sound that sounds like what hbar does i think with their supply during the test phase of the project two million planets that's what they call them so you can earn planets now we're allocated to reward data streams as soon as this allocation will be exhausted the project will be officially launched then the present token model shall apply and the total amount of tokens allocated to data rewards shall be 4.2 billion okay um for technical reasons there's a transition period um okay there's the little pie graph of it and here is their plan following the the launch the token release schedule is set at 534 million planets per year this rate will be halved every four years okay the hard cap is 4.5 billion so they have a 60-year plan folks this is what you gotta look for this is what you gotta look for hbar has a hundred year plan lehman baird has said multiple times that he is they're trying to build a 100-year plus company that's what i call generational wealth generational wealth where you know for sure you're going to be holding some planets still in 30 years because they've planned for it they planned it plan it um that's what i look for i look for the the longevity i'm here to like you can really make generational wealth off this stuff especially someone if you're my age if you're 20 oh man you're on the right path if you're if you're with me right now in this moment in time and you're 20 years old shout out to you we are on the right path or if you're any age any age and you're here right now that means your eyes are on on on the prize uh planet tokens can be redeemed against products and services by first converting them into earth credits that sounds dope carbon credits earth credits planet watch is building a network of sensors blah blah blah and then they cover the sensor types right here i haven't really got into this daily streams each sensor type we set a default streaming frequency which determines the maximum number of streams per day which can be awarded the number of actual data streams sent to our platform may be higher um okay here's the reward pool honestly i don't really care what i earned from it it would be dope like it's so beneficial in many ways to get one of these so i might actually get one i might get one or a few can you get more than one because i could place one outside then i could place one i could get an indoor one i don't know um okay they got this pixel stuff scroll down i probably have to read all this but this is more about just the sensor um and the reward pools but i'm really focused on this as an actual investment too like i might drop a bag i probably 100 i think i will drop a um a bag on this as an actual investment now we have covered their token model and we have covered their website there's the planet token planets our utility tokens on the agaron blockchain planets are earned when a sensor sends valid air quality data to planet watch earth credits are needed to obtain planet watch products and services earth credits are non-exchangeable and tied to a single user fixed in euros in fiat money earth credits are 0.10 okay if planet tokens that makes sense so how many tokens can you earn per day depends on the sensor basically when will the token be listed and where the token will be listed on a major exchange what does that mean we will disclose details in the coming weeks that's all that's all they want to say about that wow okay token will be listed on a major exchange um sensors uh region okay why iphone users might earn fewer tokens if you have an iphone dang so really you can't send background data that's annoying that's annoying man i might there's one person in my family within with a android okay let's move on to um this right here this is all the same people this is a circle trust me or just you don't have to trust me but just know my thoughts on this are these are all the same people the world economic forum blue united nations blue cern blue ripple blue international monetary fund blue world bank group blue something is going on there's a circle of people they're rising something up to the surface also planet watch of blue and green of course um so i don't know why i put this i just put this to show you that i think these people are all the same people so i choose to invest in what they're doing because they're gonna do it anyways they're gonna do it anyways right here they've got two projects already the city of milan and the city of taranto toronto uh tyranto connected sensor 76 22 so this is really like this is super fresh super fresh so these sensors let's check out the sensors now around you does this one send background data wi-fi and bluetooth for setup required let's look at it let's click on it this is ariana i love how they gave it a name like that out of stock hold up are they out of stock okay this one is in stock so you could get the atmo tube pro that's what i might get um it checks the air quality around you it can be attached to a backpack a bike how small is it i guess it's pretty small then so oh yeah right here oh yeah it's tiny this is really like some future stuff this is some future stuff it's scary kind of that this thing is going to be sending data um you also get 500 planet tokens with it i guess device communicates through bluetooth with your smartphone so this looks very interesting um what about this one in total absence estimated battery life is a week wow this one's out of stock though that's the one i would have wanted because this one looks like it doesn't need the background data thing um so this is very interesting i highly recommend you guys look into into um planet watch and keep an eye on this keep an eye on this because i think this is going to be big i think this is going to be uh big with that cern and on the algorand blockchain is all for this video i wanted to make a video on this um new find that i found on linkedin this is connected to algorand as we saw connected to cern which is very interesting and i think this is going to be big this is going to be big i'm early on this um and once it gets listed on an exchange i might actually get some and i might get the sensor so definitely keep your eye on this this is not promotion or anything i'm simply sharing information with you um but that is all thank you so much for watching definitely keep an eye on this one um make sure you subscribe click the post notification bell on check all the links in the description and walking my goodbye it must have been my day seemed like the perfect match for me so she said to me craig can you give me what i want i don't know about you but i feel so good", "eONNGZ4LBFY": "[Music] i [Music] so [Music] come on in everybody come on in oh hell here we go good evening texas bikers and bikers all across the nation this is texas biker radio my name is male popeye moss mel og robbins we are with sons of liberty writers mc who are sponsors of this show each and every week and tonight uh we're going to start out with with some biker stuff all you got people there waiting for the national stuff hang on your seats we're going to be getting to it we're going to be getting to it but you know we are a political group this is what we do we talk about events of the day the week the month the year and just base basic crap that's going on around the country right now and we we had some interesting stuff today we uh we noticed that uh the folks over in staying throttle were talking about twin peaks and the uh the trials and stuff that went on in waco and really i think uh in the end the jest of his story and we do encourage you to go watch it because it is important because it points out the corruption that exists within our courts within the fbi within the dps in texas even though they weren't mentioned that much it is an incredible thing what we see going on and our courts are as corrupt as hell whether they're at the federal level whether they're at the state level whether they're at the the city level at the civil level whatever you want to call it there oh gee it is incredible the things we see going on by our law enforcement and the courts around this nation right now with stuff we've been witnessing for years call it what it is it always starts at the top and works its way to the bottom it certainly does you got the federal government that's not worth a damn and only wants to hurt the people yep and that starts with the executive branch goes right into the congressional and into the court system the supreme court used to be held in high esteem yeah as did the fbi now they're in the seller yes and look what we got for a president you know their their approval ratings ought to be lower than a used car salesman or congress for that matter [Music] just what i'm saying so you know it it's just like uh watching uh watching newsmax tonight for a little while there was a story published by the washington post here not too long ago during the elections where trump supposedly made an intimidating threatening phone call to the election officials in georgia and the washington post reported that he was trying to intimidate them into finding fraud in the election well first i would submit to you that you wouldn't have to try and find fraud it was all over the place however uh that story has since been debunked and found to be very untrue they did in the same story who were now trying to say they didn't have any part of it so you know and uh it's just blatant you see the public watches this the department of justice is watching it you know there's a whole new term for the media and journalists out there and let's call them what they are they're propagandists they don't report the news hell they don't even give an opinion they're trying to feed propaganda 24 7. yeah and that's all they're doing hey let me check something out here oh gee i see that our our live stream is not streaming for some reason even though everything here shows us that it is uh you guys on the chat line can you hear us let us know and can you see us we're waiting patiently they can't see us can hear us loud and clear just no video feed okay uh should we keep on going with just audio guys or should we uh or should we or should we uh stop and reprogram it uh so uh and i really hate to do that because we're i i can't imagine why this is not working i can try a couple things here let me let me get it going we do have it recording so um okay feel free to keep going o.g we'll we'll do it without the video sorry sorry ladies and gentlemen we there's nothing we can do about this we've got it set up everything shows on this end to be working but we we do see that the the video portion of it is not rolling for some reason don't have it i don't have a clue why that's okay after the last five days i look like a worn out piece of uh road alligator that's true okay so we we finished uh talking about what a piece of crap uh you know the fbi the texas the the department of public safety here in texas it's deplorable yeah and and the people that uh you know our courts our courts are just screwed up and they will they will they will send innocent people to jail and we're talking about the fbi the texas department of sub public safety uh the dea and all these other agencies that will send innocent people to jail just to get a notch in their belt to to try and promote them themselves get more money for their organizations the list runs on and on and on and block by any way in any means any attempt to dismantle the existing corrupt structure exactly and you know people are now recognizing they're now seeing entities government entities that they they thought that they thought was out to protect them and because that's what they will say they're doing is they're we're protecting the public we're protecting the public and that's a bunch of bs that's what it is they're they're there to promote themselves now are there's are there some good guys out there we are sure there are but people at the top the people at the top are corrupt as hell and we're seeing it throughout our government throughout we it's hard to find out nowaday anybody that's not corrupt because they're all in on the game except for us we thought we thought we had a government that was working for us now there's many of us that's known for a very long time that that is not the case we're now seeing it wide open for everybody to see everybody to see and it seems as though half half the country is asleep at the freaking wheel now i just did i just posted a poll while ago at sons of liberty writers mc on facebook asking what you're going to do with your stimulus money and we're going to go there in a minute but oh gee let's talk about our trip uh that took us outside of texas for the first time in many months well we had an opportunity to make a hell of a lot of money i'll tell you that now picture this we had a truck with a what the hell was that about a 20 uh it was a 24 foot trailer 26 foot 28 foot trailer as a toy hauler yeah big son of a gun i mean it was driving like almost like driving a small semi now from here to arizona there's a border check that you go through and from arizona coming back to texas there's a border check yep now they had all the cones in the lanes pulling all the traffic over and lining us all up like the humble little sheep that we've become yeah well guess what even though they love to create traffic jams this guy i'm sure is going to be filing some kind of workman's comp claim on a wrist injury because all he was doing was waving traffic not checking anybody you know i felt like telling the driver of the uh of the truck with the trailer hey turn around let's go back pick up a few yeah a thousand ahead yeah and make some money exactly because we can come back through and we even part of the trip as we were tooling along in new mexico we saw some illegals running on the railroad tracks about uh what is it about 50 yards off the off the side of the road yeah and a border patrol truck came by not too much longer just booking like hell never stopped come on in everybody come on in welcome to america welcome to your free bread basket medical care school and hey while your avid add it spread some disease around yeah unbelievable unbelievable everybody not even a glance into the car not even the glance into your saddlebags on your motorcycle not a glance into nothing we could have been we could have been making some big bucks oh gee oh hell yeah it's a big box but that's not us but there are plenty of people out there that are watching this they're watching this and the opportunity now is limitless if you were to go to the other side now let's let's tell them the reason we went to arizona the reason the reason we went to arizona we lost uh back in late november right our chapter president in arizona uh he was actually a charter member of that chapter great leader great veteran yeah highly decorated he was in the army rangers uh saw lots of action but at any rate he went down now normally you know in a national club everyone goes out immediately uh to honor a a fallen brother but due to the horrendous lockdowns in arizona and new mexico and hey texas wasn't so great at that time either we had to delay and we delayed until march 13th uh when a a last ride was scheduled and that's the reason we were headed out there to to honor our fallen brother and uh we had uh a few members from every chapter show up which was great it was great to get together it was a sad reason to get together but nonetheless the brotherhood grows anytime you do something like that right so we took we took advantage of the trip to view just what in the hell was going on at least in three states uh relative to the uh to the lockdown and how it was being treated how people were being treated how scared were the sheeple that we saw running around with their masks outdoors even and i got to tell you it was something arizona wasn't too bad people there are fighting back a little bit and uh we weren't actually in phoenix we were in an area called black canyon which is a little north and east of phoenix great area of the country and the folks there were just great didn't see anyone wearing any masks everyone had a great time we had breakfast in closer to phoenix the day we left at an ihop and while they had mask signs everywhere uh the way we kind of ran it was we walked in without wearing a mask we had a mask with us if they asked us to please mask up we complied if they didn't say anything we weren't wearing the mask and they treated us great new mexico was a horror story yeah and i'll let popeye tell you about that one yeah uh because because you can't see it right now i had a uh a and i want to say one thing right now apologize to anybody that just joined us that for some reason the video portion of this thing is not streaming we are recording it and we uh we hope that uh you'll be able to if you want to see the video portion of it you'll be able to see it over at rumble later on after we uh load it upload it there and we'll post the uh the link to that at texas like a radio facebook or sons of liberty writers mc on facebook you'll be able to find the link to the rumble upload there and so again we apologize for some reason for some reason it's not streaming uh but we do have the audio so we want to thank you for hanging in there with us now let me talk about new mexico for a second because that was a different a little bit of a different animal and let me say this there are people in all of these states and especially the ones that are in hard lockdowns that are beginning to let up somewhat but it's still a nightmare it's a nightmare to uh to go into a hotel it's a nightmare to get get some sort of breakfast anywhere especially if it's on a weekend because anything and everything is almost drive through and when you go into a restaurant like in new mexico if you saw the advertisement for this video on uh any of our facebook sites it is the uh the restaurant we were in in new mexico and if you look and see how far apart the tables are it was incredible i don't know how they're making it and in many cases they're not they're not we saw a lot of boarded up business there's a lot of boarded up businesses and i we we don't have people are living and we'll get to that here in a minute because oh gee we just had a friend today he lost his job you know what he does they put audio systems in churches wow and because churches have been shut down and not willing to fight back he has now lost his job because they just don't have enough business to to keep their employees and we see this going on everywhere everywhere and while everybody's getting real giddy about their 1400 stimulus check and let me tell everybody right now this year that 1200 check you got that 1400 check you got is not protected from creditors in other words if you've been sliding on some stuff those creditors are now going to be able they can come after your check before you ever get it and that may be what's happening to people that have not gotten their checks yet it it is insane what is going on and there are people out there that are giddy about this check because we have been screwed literally understand they've had two stimulus packages two six trillion dollars and guess what og the money that went out to these entities this time they don't have to be spent this year where's the emergency everybody slush where is the freaking emergency they don't have to spend the money this year that's because there is no emergency it is crazy what's going on six trillion dollars you know what that could have worked out to be for for you and i and everybody else six trillion dollars times three divided by 350 million people that's everybody would have been 18 000 a pop i could get a little giddy over that you could get giddy over that one but no you got to understand where where the where the money's gone however gone you must remember there's an old old lesson that we've been taught since childhood ain't no such thing as a free lunch that's right okay and i'll tell you what's coming at you down the tracks it's a freight train yeah take a look at the new proposed taxes that biden and crew have in mind oh yeah okay oh yeah i mean it's corporate tax individual tax capital gains tax uh you're not only going to pay in spades for this overspending you may well pay with your job because what's that right with these corporate taxes going up and capital gains these corporations aren't going to play they've got contingency plans and if you think they've been sitting on their thumbs uh they had a contingency plan in case trump didn't get reelected yeah and they will be re-establishing corporate offices overseas they'll be re-establishing assembly lines yes manufacturing so you've got jobs they're going to be leaving the country you're not going to be able to afford well if you sell some things and you do happen to make a capital gain they're going to tax the holy crap out of it because it's going to be well over 40 percent so you know there's no such thing as a free lunch and you got a real nightmare coming relative to tax hikes and if you think they can't get by with it watch them do it just like the gasoline prices that have gone up here recently you haven't been paying it attention to the pump shame on you because pretty soon you're going to have to float alone to fuel your car i paid four dollars a gallon to fill that that holly up in uh arizona yup four bucks a gallon everybody imagine if that were a gas tank in a car yeah or even worse a pickup truck with a 40 gallon tank where we're headed this is where we're headed we're we're headed back to the obama economy and walk speed is where we're headed everybody be giddy about your 1400 but let's let's let's say this less than nine percent of that stimulus package went to coven with the coveted relief nine percent is all the rest of it was spread out to all all these crazy different entities i mean it was pushed off to pay the elites is what was done less than nine percent for c-17 27 of it went to state and local governments to the tune of 500 billion dollars yeah 21 policies for uh for uh employment policies for employment 400 billion dollars national endowment we've heard that one before they've been paid before but they got a bump oh gee this time 125 million oh yeah yeah national endowment for the humanities everybody that's got a lot to do with kobe oh hell yes oh hell yes let's get them money let's get them 145 million huh just saying no money for these people out here on the streets these homeless people we've got all kinds of problems and we're throwing money to all these different little pet projects and funds and everything else we're out of our minds for not being out in the streets over this but we do see what's happening they're protecting themselves from us is what's going on they're they're protecting themselves from us 200 million dollars for the institute of museums and library services 200 million bucks we could have done a lot for a lot of people with 200 million dollars going to the right places but you know you know a lot of this money is just going to make it right back to them oh sure they're going to get a portion of it these entities but it's going to go back to them you know why lg because nobody nobody follows this money it's unaccountable yeah and here's here's another thing that people ought to pay attention to that they probably didn't notice in almost everything that has gone up for legislation there have been crossovers yeah between the democrats and the republicans yep you always get some democrats that'll cross over and you invariably get rhinos oh yeah you do crossover we get them every time i would say there's probably more incident of republican crossing over to the democrat side what's interesting is with this covet bill not one republican voted for it yeah in the house not one they all stood their ground and said this bill is [ __ ] it's nothing but a pork barrel and by golly once you get into it and you read what's going on that's absolutely all it is it's a slush fund for the blue cities that are in financial crisis pelosi took care of her people schumer took care of his people and right on down the line any blue city that was in trouble now has cash coming to keep them afloat and that's not what should have happened they should have been able they should have collapsed they should have collapsed into dust and risen again appropriately so uh you know nobody paid attention to that let me say this oh gee if youtube's got a problem with any of this this is stuff that's just already been reported it's already been reported it's already out there huh go fact check it go do it five percent of the 1.9 trillion dollars this time goes to k-12 schools and it doesn't have to be spent this year schools are swimming in money everybody they're swimming in money and just to show you how it works what they're what they're wanting to do in california with with this with their kovic money is give teachers a bonus a six thousand dollar bonus has anybody as anybody offered you a six thousand dollar bonus to get your ass back to work and i know they have it here in texas because we've got teachers that are back to work and i got family members that are teachers they haven't been given those kind of bonuses and this is the kind of crap that's going on everybody this is the kind of stuff that's going on you need to remember this you need to remember this at these next midterms we've got to overwhelm the damn system no matter even if it's corrupt and we've got to get out there and enforce these legislatures to do the job of cleaning up the election process they've got to clean it up because these bunch of criminals that's what i'm going to call them anybody that voted for this stuff in the congress in the senate are criminals are freaking criminals their thieves and their sellouts to foreign governments it includes and og i hate to say this it includes our freaking military because they've gone woke yep totally woke everybody everything is about transgenders and women and everything else all of it's designed to create chaos all of it every bit of it and it continues day after day after day and if you're not mad yet i don't know why you you've got to be able to convince your family members that have been that have been that have been turned against their country especially your children that hey this is wrong this is not right and this is corrupt and i probably will get thrown off youtube tonight but it will be a rumble everybody it will be on rumble and me wheeze where it'll be and let me tell you uh me we is a breath of fresh air because you do not get these damn commercials every five seconds on there we do not monetize our videos and information we put out and really all we're doing is commenting on what's already out there try switching that in try to what try switching that one in like we're showing them something just for the hell of it okay we're going to try something here everybody it's an experiment yeah if we get knocked off about what uh you tell me this one right here yeah okay let's uh all right we'll see what happens there see if it does anything i don't think it will but you know hey like i said this is recording this is recording and hopefully it's recording the video on um still i don't know why it's not streaming so anybody has joined us it is not streaming we have audio for some reason our video is not streaming tonight and uh it's just oh wait a minute did i do that while ago i don't see it over there no you've been here yeah oh my gosh everybody hang on hang on you think it's gonna happen i don't know oh my gosh everybody this is my fault this is my fault oh my gosh so that means that you know what that means oh gee even in the recording it didn't it didn't do okay so that's my fault everybody i didn't switch the cube oh my gosh for that for that oh gee we gotta start over [Laughter] oh my gosh oh i'm sure everybody out there i'm going to put a note up here on the screen switch the cube this side dummy this side oh i'm glad you brought that up oh oh my gosh hey but you know what it gets better everybody there's five billion dollars of uh emergency housing vouchers you think that's going out do you think do you think that emergency housing vouchers are going out to all these homeless people that are out there across the country that's somebody's personal selection we're gonna monitor that one everybody we're gonna go out and see how many people out there have gotten their emergency housing vouchers that's reminiscent of the motorcycle safety fund the motorcycle safety fund thieves everybody thieves they're still stealing from us in the motorcycle safety fund here in texas and that would be the damn dps crooks everybody crooks politicians crooks that make these laws that allows this and we're battling that now in the state legislature and wait a minute oh gee we got 7 billion out there it's going to child care now i don't know so much that i disagree with that but aren't the parents and everybody staying at home well just exactly where the hell is the seven billion going it's not going to parents pockets does anybody know does anybody know we'll have to check that out too yeah i mean it would seem to me if they were going to subsidize child care the money would be going to people that had children so they could afford to pay child support care to go to work yeah now i'm not hearing about anybody getting any extra money for child care so uh you know and these child care centers make their money off of the parents exactly and the fee that they charge to supposedly care for your child so i think that's another slush fund it will be another slush fund and let me say something to forrest stootsman there uh i know who you're talking about there buddy i know who you're talking about he's from the dallas area also yeah he's an interesting character and uh he does know how to he does know how to fight city hall and the government yeah he does interest interesting guy your neons not on are they talking about that yes yes you need to turn on your neon hey you guys i was miss i was messed up by the time change i barely got out here and got got things set up [Laughter] plus i'm still i had my eyes checked today and they're still dilated no wonder i'm missing stuff yeah the last time i saw popeye we were screaming down i-20 last night as we approached our turn-offs in arlington he was screaming like a banshee going about 90 to 100 miles an hour that's right and the last that's the last i saw of him till tonight yeah so god only knows what the hell happened to him between now and then and you know it was it was interesting last night guys because uh i had still had on my dart sealed and i couldn't see crap especially i'd already hit a rubber alligator in the road which might knock my kickstand spring off that was right outside sweetwater yep yep and uh so uh that happened and then uh it was uh i was trying to see the rubber alligator so i had to lift the dark shield up and uh i was uh we were running i don't know 75 85 90 at times uh you know really and i'm i'm looking like crazy for more rubber alligators because i already already had contact with one um and that was the steel cord of a tire and uh so you know i'm i'm looking out through there but my eyes were working good man because i've seen a long ways out there and it took out the spring on his kickstand it sure did it was flying everywhere but it was uh it was interesting but you guys could you have used 18 000 each that'd be forever man woman child baby could you could your child have used a 18 000 college fund i mean what could you expect that on but instead we've got a deal posted up now at sons of liberty writers mc on facebook asking you what you're going to do with your fourteen hundred dollars that everybody's so giddy about just wondering everybody just wonder so go take that survey do it please that that poll so we'll get a kind of idea you know you're going to save it for a rainy day in case things get way worse or you're going to go out there and buy you a color tv they're pretty cheap now a new cell phone oh yeah they're not so cheap they're not so cheap that's right the tvs the the uh the big screen tvs with the fancy 4k screens and all this other stuff they're cheap the cell phones aren't go figure everybody go figure and of course we don't know how much fema got they got a bunch of money too it's just been thrown around everywhere everybody it's thrown around everywhere and a lot of that money is just going to make it back to them we've been screwed screwed and you need to pass that on to everybody you know we've got to fight back against these these media outlets you want to discuss them a minute we need to prepare to resist you cannot listen to anything anymore with the exception of a very few stations and believe what the hell they're telling you uh of course you know it's been a little dead since trump has been quiet as a matter of fact uh they're trying to push polls out there now that say trump has lost his grip on the gop because nothing's happening well he's being very quiet and rest assured i think at least i certainly hope there are some things going on in the background that are gonna come to fruition before very long uh you know it uh we still have not seen anything from this new president other than a hell of a lot of dictatorial executive orders and i do understand he has now scheduled a press conference on march 25th nobody should miss this one there's a pool going as to first of all how long do you think the news conference is going to go now yeah yeah that'll be good everybody whenever trump had a news conference it usually went close to an hour there is no way sleepy joe can last an hour the money seems to be on uh somewhere some people think 15 minutes and others believe that no in order for it to be a credible news conference it needs to go at least 20 minutes somewhere between 20 and 30. now the next question is how many questions do you think he's going to take uh the belief is he's not gonna take many questions because once you ask the dummy a question he will ramble on forever saying absolutely nothing other than embarrass himself and if he's not wearing a diaper i'm sure he's pissed his pants before the thing's over with anyway or or or he will do this joining us live this morning from new york hey good morning wake up wake up wake up breathing okay this is your wake-up call all day nothing okay um i'll tell you what we are going he's yeah he's meditating he's having he's taking a little [Music] joining us live this morning from and the final question is is he going to take the questions directly from the media or is he going to have that garbage truck redhead take the questions you know call on the media this is going to be interesting to see what happens we're going to be able to tell if they're all softball questions that are easy to answer that can be answered in a little short sentence and uh we'll see if he goes off script or he falls asleep one or the other well his meds should keep him propped up for the short period that's true that's true the stuff they put him on is is going to be incredible so let's watch with with such excitement everybody hanging on every word every lie every piece of propaganda that the media puts out and that he puts out and his minions put out let's hang on to it all everybody and then point out what the hell's really going on and let me say this everybody oh oh fouty fouty is out there he cannot refuse a camera anybody he cannot refuse a camera so what does he do he goes he goes on a damn show and i guess it's in a hispanic show because he goes on a show with a hispanic comedian yeah and i'm gonna show this real quick i don't know that i want to play it or not but what this guy well i'll tell you what i'll play a little bit of it let's see if it uh see if the audio is pretty good you guys let us know team technology ever been injected into humans before well this is the first time well this is the first time well this is the first time yes dr fauci so first question which of the kovit 19 vaccines have been officially approved by the fda three of them one from moderna which is the mrna vaccine one from pfizer which is another mrna vaccine and the other one is from j and j johnson and johnson which is a little bit different it gives the same kind of response but it's a little bit different so there are three vaccines that have gotten emergency use authorization from the fda so far there are a couple of others that are still being tested to determine if they're safe and effective but the three that i just mentioned have been shown in very large clinical trials involving anywhere from 30 000 to 44 000 people per trial was shown to be not only very efficacious but quite safe okay so i i i asked if it was approved by the fda uh but i i think that it's a different thing that to an emergency use authorization than an approval so what is the difference between an emergency use authorization and an official approval by the fda yes that's a very good question so an emergency use authorization is based on the criteria benefit suggests to that what happened there was is he uh that comedian got him to admit that the vaccine is in an emergency authorized vaccine that they had done some studies and you know it was uh things were looking good and had not had full fda approval now let me say this i've had the vaccine shot i've had it the first one the first one of course you know they're saying now you only need one since you had covet that's true so now you know but let's say this everybody there's so much misinformation out there by everybody by all sides including the fda including the who and anybody else you want to talk about then we have these morons like bill gates and and uh zuckerberg and all these people that are not viral ologists they know nothing they know nothing about it but yet they're out there commenting as if they do and so is everybody else so the message is so mixed up with what they're trying to accomplish is going to be hell because everybody's throwing hand grenades at it everybody i have yet to hear the same story with any continuity it all changes it becomes a different story every time uh hell the other day they were talking about uh fauci is now looking at and considering uh advising three foot distancing instead of six yeah because of some study that was done by the cdc yeah however that was just a little flash in the news oh now almost a year later they're doing a study on on the social justice thing and a mask and now there's word out about some kind of a vaccination passport there you go everybody that's where we're headed it's being considered that before you can go into a concert and i guarantee you it will if this is really true i guarantee you that will gravitate towards before you're allowed to go in anywhere grocery stores restaurants or whatever you're going to have to show a little passport now you don't have to show any in a lot of states any information to vote you're damn sure not having to show any information to get into the country uh you know so now uh they're talking about a vaccination passport and that can get real ugly real quick you reckon anybody down on the border showing a passport just saying everybody just saying is anyone down there showing a passport is anyone down there asking about kobe 19 or is anyone being tested nobody as far as we know yeah so look uh all these major really really major businesses are still requiring mass even though now it's not mandatory here in texas but they're still requiring it so they're still going along now let me tell you everybody people on our side we know there's at least 80 million of us we have the power of the purse that's the reason we asked you to go to constitutional warriors and join up it takes five minutes to make a phone call or send an email to these businesses and we're going to post the next one tomorrow that we're going after or it may be a government entity where we want to send them thousands of messages hey we're not going to buy your product we're not going to comply we're not going to comply and you know and we may even send it to the military who has now gone woke look women can serve in the military now they can serve in a maternity jumpsuit that's right and with fashion hairstyles whether you agree with that or not you know hey that's that's up to you i got my own opinion about it and i'm sure you know there are millions of us that do but we're going to be silenced if we speak up speak up but we're going to have to get used to that we're going to have to get used to that a lot of the people that we listen to uh you know are are now they've been booted off the channel you can find them in other places it's a little bit harder and i'm sure we'll get our turn too we've already had it once but then again we do not monetize so we're not on the radar as much as much because i do feel we've uh we've we've skated on some things but understand we got a lot going on out there we've got a lot to battle against and we've got to come together and that's the truth of it we've got to come together not in a violent form because they're waiting for us to do that even though even though they are out in the streets in the western states again in portland in seattle in other places antifa's raising their heads again and let me tell you this minneapolis is going to be set on fire again they're just waiting and it won't matter oh gee what the verdict is it's not going to satisfy them that's right not going to satisfy them they are just waiting to rip it apart and they're waiting to they're waiting and ready and willing to rip this nation apart is what they're ready to do and they are waiting for us to take some kind of action that gives them an excuse to come after us and that is exactly what we did on january 6th and now they're they're trying their best to throw all those people under the bus with a rigged a rigged court system rigged by corrupt prosecutors rigged by corrupt courts at all levels at all levels even though all they did many of them just entered the building there are there were people that did things that are that are against the law and wrong yeah well you can see videos still of the capitol police waving them in exactly what the hell was that all about exactly what they were doing it was a setup from the word go whether youtube likes that or not that's the truth and they know it but yet they spread propaganda just as the mainstream media does day after day after day hoping you're gonna buy it hoping you're gonna buy it and hoping that you're gonna love your fourteen hundred dollars it's sickening everybody it's sickening and i'm sorry that i did not start the video with the first of this damn thing i'm trying it's driving me nuts to know that that happened because it wouldn't be the first time but i think we caught it uh earlier the last well it beats the hell out of the old days when i used to get a call from you after the show saying oh hell it didn't record we got to do it again we had that happen yeah back back in the early days and hey just to really piss you off you guys here in texas just to really piss you off it really pisses you off when you find out that you know at one point the governor was out there uh pushing these wind farms pushing them and you know one of the things is it really pisses you off when you find out two of them right now are owned by chinese entities yeah by the chinese government everybody because anything that comes out of china is owned by the government you take that to the bank and there's going to be a third one everybody there's going to be a third one let me see one of them is called the the rattlesnake wind farm now it must be out in west texas i would assume and the other one is called the heart of texas and it's got to be in the austin area yeah and it's owned by goldwyn america a subsidiary of shanghai based zing jiang cold wind science and technology i'll bet they got a back door into those grids listen to this they are the largest the largest windmill manufacturer in the world you can bet if they're allowed to put those farms in they got a back door into them yeah and whenever they're going to want to do it they're going to shut them down and this will really make your peckers stand up basically when you find out that one of them the newest one here is going to be near an air force training base oh my i wonder what other gadgets are going to yeah to watch and see what's going on oh my god everybody just no telling how much corruption there can be had who's been bought off who's real who's not you know we know our governor you know he loves to get in front of the media like all the other talking heads well remember let me throw this out there remember the old i mean while we're going for tin hat [ __ ] here yeah uh remember the old suitcase nukes russians came up with yeah i'm sure they've been refined even smaller uh what's to stop someone from putting a little nuke in one of those wind turbines in several of them surrounding a few military installations boom yeah hey beings were saying come on in everybody come on in everybody just come on here and have your way bend over kiss your ass goodbye that's right we're getting wild tonight oh gee we may get thrown off for sure but that's what uh that's what a ride like that you know they're going out to and visiting with your brothers and seeing what's going on out across the nation and of course that wasn't a trip across the nation but you know what it was far enough to get a taste of what's going on in these other states that are suffering from these severe lockdowns i just can't imagine the stupidity of our government allowing china into our front and backyard and let me say this everybody we're talking about the stupidity of the government we're talking about the stupidity of half the american people that are buying into this crap that have bought into what's gone on over the last four months that have in a military that is buying in also we look for them to protect us and to defend the constitution the oath that they took which they are not doing which they are capitulating to communist and communist sympathizers the very thing we as veterans have been fighting against most of our lives all of mine and all of og's we can't imagine we can't imagine that a military command would put up with this at all because we have people that are selling us out totally lock stock and barrel pissing money away like it's water funding foreign entities that are corrupting this country and if you listen to what the chinese said and what we said in one of the last shows the chinese were talking about how their young men have been wussified and they're going to take steps to change it and that included their military yet we're going to push things the other direction we're going to make sure they comply with all these outrageous things if they're pushing upon our children our troops on us that's the truth of it everybody got anything you want to close with yeah let me uh let me restate something here it isn't the government that's stupid it's the people that keep voting yeah the same people in that are stupid it's the people in government that are corrupt and that's why this is allowed to being happen because they're getting their hands filled with money and their back pockets filled with money to allow it yeah okay i'm done so everything power and money corrupts follow the money follow the money and nobody's doing it nobody nobody it's like i asked a long time ago who watches the president nobody nobody well right now the puppet master is watching the puppet master is in control because nobody right now knows who the real president is and is sure not the sleeping hollow potato head just my opinion youtube just my opinion that ought to do it and how to do it so we'll see what happens everybody we'll see what happens be safe wait wait wait wait we got to say uh let's say uh hi to some people there's uh mindy mindy clear uh randy

talking about this idea of persist until you succeed so towards the end of 2020 my partner owen and i were listening to a podcast that matthew mcconaughey was on and he was talking about how um happening upon the greatest salesman in the world at a friend's apartment this is a book by augmentino was a pivotal moment that changed his life he discussed how for 10 months he was consistent about reading the 10 scrolls as the book explains to do and how this book really helped him gain the confidence to chase his dreams to leave law school to attend film school and i'm assuming you guys know who matthew mcconaughey is and you don't need me to explain the rest of the story to you he's an extremely successful actor and i he doesn't quite fit the mold of hollywood crowd right he beats to his own drum he's created his own life his own way of doing things and the life of his dreams really if you guys haven't checked out his new book green light it's definitely worth the read it is an awesome book uh but that kind of started a conversation between me and my partner we love to read books together and and have conversations about them and dive deeper right more than just the reading so as uh oh and i listened we really thought about reading the scrolls together this year but we're like three times a day that's a big commitment uh really we were hesitant but excited and and none of neither of us really like to go with the flow we we like to carve our own path go against the green that's what they say right so we decided that it worked for matthew mcconaughey hey let's give it a try so we decided to go for it and we started reading the scrolls the second week of january and we just moved to the scroll number three and the message in the scroll was timed so well for me um as usual when things are timed well for me and i share them i hear from you guys that it's exactly what you needed to hear so i was called to come on and have this conversation with you so here we go i will persist until i succeed often in life we set goals we get excited we create plans and then life happens we fall out of routine we lose momentum even worse we feel like we've been trying and trying and we're just not making any progress that whole saying of you know plant seeds and they'll bloom later right it's like i'm sick of planting seeds i've been planting seeds forever right and and sometimes you just get to this point where you feel like nothing's going to happen and you want to quit right and that's where this comes in i will persist until i succeed have you experienced it in life before you're doing you know that just enough to not slip back but you can't seem to make forward momentum i know i've experienced it i know i still experience it right like when when is that break gonna happen when am i gonna reach this goal i've been talking about this goal for years what what is gonna have to happen to make that change right what makes me keep putting one foot in front of the other what makes me keep waking up every day with this passion in my heart and soul to reach my goals what does it mean to truly persist until you succeed all right what does it mean to put in the blood sweat and tears when no one even sees what you're doing you're not reaping the rewards when you're not even seeing the rewards of the hard work you're putting in right this quote is out of the third scroll the prizes of life are at the end of each journey not near the beginning and it is not given to me to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal failure i may still encounter at the sa the thousandth step yet success hides behind the next bend in the road never will i know how close it lies unless i turn the corner i will persist until i succeed i i really think that's an important thing to talk about right it's like we when we set goals like we don't know when when they're going to happen we can set timelines we can have action plans we can have everything mapped out but life happens and we don't quite know when everything's going to run the way that we're hoping it does we're not quite sure when all the pieces are going to fall into place right when we half-heartedly want something we're not going to persist right we're going to quit we'll walk away we'll walk away when things get hard we'll walk away when things aren't fun anymore but let's be real everything worth it is hard staying in shape is hard keeping relationships in a healthy standpoint are is hard right building businesses they can be hard they can also be amazing all of this can be amazing without the peaks we don't have the valleys not the valleys we don't have the peaks we need both right so i always like to talk about goals in three main areas health wealth and relationships right those are the three areas that i always talk about them so let's talk about this idea in relationships right so take my relationship with owen it's not always easy we have um past traumas that come up they need to be healed they need to be discussed we get triggered we have to have hard conversations but we have our eyes on the prize we have our eyes on our future with our feet in the present we know that if we are going to which we know we are create the future of our dreams we need to remain fully present and fully willing to show up in the here and now in this moment we are willing to do whatever work it takes to get to the goals that we have right we always say we are living our dream life while working towards creating our dream we know what we're working towards we have a very clear picture of what we're working towards we've talked about what we want in all areas of life where do we want to live what does that look like children marriage um work business social circles we've talked about all of this because we know with such clarity where we're going therefore we're willing and more than able to keep showing up because we have clarity right so do you know the ultimate goal in your relationships and this isn't just intimate relationships right this is family relationships this is friendships this is business relationships what are you seeking to get out of those relationships is it fulfillment and joy is it because someone lifts you up is it because someone's to call you on your  when you're not doing what you're supposed to do like what are your what are you getting out of relationships why do you keep showing up for them and i think it's something to ask us in relationships too and we've talked a lot about this in the podcast it's like if are you the only one showing up for the relationship so when i say that is like are you showing up 100 for a relationship with the other person showing up 25 well then you need to maybe reevaluate how much you're showing up for that relationship because there's going to be a point where you're going to want to quit because your balance isn't being matched right so thinking about those things but knowing what you're wanting out of relationships all relationships is so important you don't just go into a business relationship and say like yeah let's just see where this goes like no you you're putting time and money and energy and care into something you need to have a clear map of where things are going and i think that's where intimate relationships have failed for me in the past is it was well let's just see where this goes and when you're with someone that's the right person you're able to say where do we want this to go what are we willing to work for what are we willing to persist for and that's important right so let's talk about our health if you're working out because someone told you you should do you really think you're gonna keep doing that when you're tired when you're sore when you're stressed if you're working out just because you know that's like what you're supposed to do but there's no other reason are you gonna keep going my answer is hell no you're gonna stop and you probably have can you relate to that can you think about a time when you're like i am gonna get healthy but you didn't have any clarity really around why and you stopped you have to have your eyes on the prize and that prize is different for every single person for some it's a number on the scale for others the scales are worst enemy others it's blood test results you needed to or you wanted to improve your blood test results right cholesterol was high blood pressure was high blood sugars were high right maybe you want to change that maybe you have an outfit that you love that you want to fit back into maybe you want to keep up with your kids you know there's no there's no right or wrong reason here but there has to be a reason where you will not persist for me my fitness my workouts everything's focused on helping me remain pain-free help to keep my back my core strong those are absolutely essential for me not living in severe daily pain there's few keys to managing my insane back injuries and spinal cord injuries it's it comes down to my essential oils my lifestyle my fitness right i have to get eight hours of sleep or more i have to use my supplements and essential oils on a regular basis i have to keep my body strong i have to keep an anti-inflammatory diet i have to do these things i have to remain low stress like they are so key for me staying out of pain so you understand here where my resolve to persist in working out is so huge i have such clarity on why i do this sure i also like to look really fit and i like to feel good in my clothes and the six pack doesn't hurt i i like to strive to those great but those aren't what's going to keep me showing up for my workouts every single day working towards my pain-free life is what makes me show up every single day on that yoga mat right so what is the reason for you that you want to remain healthy what's your pull what's your drive what's going to keep you persisting to succeed so we talk about business right so we have like health we have our relationships now we need to talk about wealth how if whether it's um working towards a promotion trying to get a new job trying to finish school building a business wanting more than the status quo wanting more than what you have right now sciency stuff i remember when i was leaving my job as a physical therapist and people were looking at me and they're like wasn't this good enough aren't you happy here and now was just never nothing's ever really enough for me because i want to be better tomorrow than i am today i want to be better today than i was yesterday and not better than anybody else better than myself i want to be a better version of myself i i've always heard this saying you know you don't you make me better and i don't think it's that anybody can make us better i think it's that if we surround ourselves with people that make us want to be better that's the key that's the key surround yourself with people who make you want to be better right and then they won't question you as you're asking for more right but wanting more in business in life in your career while maintaining balance in your relationships and your health right it's not for the faint of heart it takes a lot of work how you do one thing is how you do everything you've got to show up in all areas and you've got to put attention into all of these areas each and every day so you have to have a strong reason for me it's really simple i've been through some really really hard i've learned a lot i've learned a lot about chronic pain i've learned a lot about the western medical system [Music] what how it works how it doesn't uh learned a lot about relationships communication high conflict personality disorders emotional abuse codependency alcohol abuse sobriety fitness yoga freaking handstands you name it i've learned a lot i've been through a lot and i've learned a lot right and i've grown a lot and a lot of that time i felt very very alone i could have been around hundreds of people standing on stage in front of thousands of people and much of that time i felt very alone i never want anyone else to feel that alone i want people to know that someone understands them someone's been there before someone's been through it someone survived it someone's not going to judge them for being in a relationship with an abusive spouse someone's not going to judge them for staying in that relationship till they're ready to leave someone's not going to judge them for listening to their doctors for a time frame until they decide that they they are the ones that can control and change their health that's the person i want to be and if i can change one person's life with my video blog or a podcast or social media post or a conversation then i'm doing my job and you know so many different ways it's said but the idea of if you you do each day what you're passionate about and make a difference the money will follow right thankfully i found a way i'm really grateful that i make a living and pay the bills through what i get to do but honestly i would do it even if it wasn't there because the drive for me to help and to grow and to impact this world is what drives me to build my business so what is your why was your eye and it could be financial i have financial ones too i want to get out of college jet from my doctor physical therapy that i don't use other than in the sense that that knowledge and um effort of getting a doctor it has molded who i am right but i don't practice physical therapy on a day-to-day basis right but i will use my business that i'm growing and changing lives with to eliminate that that college debt right so there's financial pulls too but that's not the big one that like pulls me out of bed each day right but i bet you're getting the point now and i bet you um you can see this that you have to know why you're doing something with all of your heart in order to persist till you succeed you have to have a stubbornness about why you were doing that so that when you get knocked down not if you get knocked down but when you get knocked down you have a strong enough reason to get back up have you ever seen that picture of a man he's mining for gold and he's in this this mine he's got a a little like pitchfork or like little whatever it's like an axi thing i don't i don't know what it's called um i'm gonna like finish the podcast and hit stop and i'm gonna remember the name of what it's called but anyway he's like beaten at the wall of this tunnel and he's he's mining for gold mining for gold and they show him in this graphic kind of with that over his back and walking away and he's one foot away from the gold and then the guy under him is hacking away and keeps going he persists and he finds gold so if the guy on the top had just told himself that he wasn't going to quit until he succeeded he would have found goal but his why wasn't strong enough he didn't persist and he failed not because gold wasn't there not because he didn't work hard but because he let quitting be an option i was in severe chronic pain for five and a half years and in that five and a half years i never stopped looking for the next thing that could have potentially helped me decrease my pain five and a half years until i got all the puzzle pieces in order but i was never going to quit it was not an option for me five and a half years can you imagine that guys and i'm not talking like a my back hurts every day i'm talking a 4 out of 10 pain every morning when i woke up and a 7 to 9 out of 10 pain every single night when i went to bed i'm talking severe pain i'm talking could i cook dinner or do laundry because i couldn't do both but i wouldn't quit i knew there was a better way i knew there was a way out i knew i could feel better and i chose to never quit so i want you to ask yourself what goals do you have that you really want to reach i mean really want to reach start with one look in those three areas health wealth and relationships and pick one to start with you know how i like to compound things maybe this month you focus on your goal in health and the next month that's in well and then the next month is in relationships you have to do all three you have to do all three because you don't want to be the fit rich person that has no healthy relationships you don't want to be the fit person with healthy relationships that has no money to enjoy life you need to do all three and if you're the kind of person i can show up and just do all three at once then great do all three but if you need to do one at a time and layer them until you can get steady and consistent with them do that but ask yourself what goal do you have that you really want to reach then you have to ask yourself why is it important to you and you need to dig you need to ask yourself that question a dozen times why do i want to get healthy why do i want to get healthy why is that important to me why is that you know you want to get healthy because you want to look fit cool why is that important to you you want to look fit because you know that um you're gonna feel better when you're fit well why is that important to you you wanna be able to keep up with your kids or your grandkids well why is that important to you why why why why why why dig deep ask yourself why this is what i do with my clients i'm not going to take their first answer of why it's not that's not a good enough answer you got to dig deep are you ready to persist with this goal until you succeed and if the answer is no you didn't dig deep enough you don't have a strong enough why you don't have a strong enough reason pulling you in that direction you need to have a strong why so once you have that if you're stuck just message me on ig say hello take a look at it think about it and if you're stuck message me i'll help you so how do you keep yourself motivated i use a lot of different things i have affirmations that i read every day they're kind of taped all over my house i have a vision board that helps keep my eyes on the prize and i have on their health wealth and relationship goals you i surround myself with people who cheer me on and believe in me the people that get time for me are the ones that believe that my goals are attainable that believe that i

"tb1NE99Srj0": "[Music] sashka the beat so [Music] you", "0Sz5zRCMxXA": "what's going on youtube geosnowright here so in today's video i'm going to show you something pretty interesting i'm going to show you yesterday's athena's basically running on a device with my jailbreak blizzard jailbreak and basically making the jailbreak to run by itself and jailbreak the device immediately after reboot without user intervention so this is actually pretty cool is the closest we're going to get to an antetether at this point but do keep in mind before we even start the video please don't skip this part this is not a jailbreak for ios 14.4 this is not a jailbreak for 14.4.1 do not update the 14.4 or 14.4.1 there is no jailbreak available yet so this sort of fun tether code execution zero click thing that they have i don't even know how to call it it's actually legitimate and it would actually work on 14.4 but this doesn't come with a jailbreak this is just the automation part for the jailbreak to make it run after a reboot by itself it's not a jailbreak so do keep that in mind and it's not even a full untether like it's not an og on tether you know with code sign bypass and persistence and stuff like that it's basically just able to run the jailbreak by itself and jailbreak your device after reboot without you tapping on the application and going to it i actually have a demo with my blizzard jailbreak doing exactly that without me touching the device or anything like that in the coming minutes but please do not skip this information is important so for those of you interested in blizzard it's basically an open source jailbreak that i maintain that i have created for basically my test cases it's not complete there's nowhere near completion yet because really it doesn't have to it's not a competition between me cool star and pound tone and stuff like that they can have the mainstream jailbreaks i made blizzard just to basically learn so i actually improve it as i can and as i have time but really i mostly use it for testing purposes but yeah it does have tfp zero it can basically get the fb0 on ios 13 ios 11 and even ios 14 with securiverosa up to 14.3 but not 14.4 keep that in mind so what i did was to basically take the code from athena's dev team here who these poor schmucks have actually received the most hate i could see ever from you know toxic people calling them fake and stuff like that and i want to set the record straight they are not fake okay what they have may not be an ant tether like they claim here but really i called it the same thing yesterday because there isn't really a better word for it to make you understand what it does because it kinda is like an antetter it makes your jawbreak to basically run by itself immediately after boot without you touching the device so by the time the device fully boots you're already jailbroken but it's not really an untether in an og way and that's probably why they get a lot of hate but many people believe that it's actually completely fake well it's not their method works it requires a lot of mumbo jumbo with xcode downgrading xcode to a very old version to you know take advantage of a very old sdk because apparently apple patched this they didn't really patch their own device side so if you are able to use an older sdk you are able to trigger this into your jailbreak and make your jailbreak run by itself immediately after reboot pretty cool it's a neat trick not a full and tether with an exploit but a neat trick so with that being said please don't update the 14.4 or 14.4.1 and this is not something major like wow a huge anteater exploit or stuff like that it's a neat trick i'm not sure how useful it would be for jailbreak purposes but for me it's pretty cool because it allows me to have a jailbreak that actually read jailbreaks by itself every time the phone reboots but you would still need to sign the application every seven days or to get a paid developer account to sign it for one year with this warnings and you know disclaimers said let's see it in action with the blizzard jailbreak that i have created right so the device boots let's see exactly what's going on here it should run the blizzard application by itself without problems okay there we go it booted now we're waiting for it to start running the things in the background and there you go as you can see it completely ran the jailbreaking application and it got tfp0 you can see it's a valid tfp zero port and a proper kernel base let me try to focus a little bit so it says device is now jailbroken task for ps0 has been achieved cut root escape sandbox and wrote the test file and you can see that it was successfully initialized this should work pretty fine and if i open the blizzard which has a very rudimentary ui here just for testing purposes it says already jailbroken so as you can see it does run by itself so i'm going to clear all those notifications now let me actually do that if i could let me do it off screen all right so i have cleared all the notifications and i'm going to restart this device and i'm going to show you again that it can run so let me restart it um i want to wait for it to shut down completely and okay i think it's the time to redo it i'm gonna restart it and bam okay so let's see it should run again the exploit without any problem so this is basically as close as you can get to an untether nowadays it's not a full-on tether but it's pretty similar so as you can see the device booted and i'm not even touching it just to you know show you ui and stuff and as you can see blizzard started initializing again got the kernel base again you can actually even compare it to the previous part of the video and you can see it's a completely different thing so yeah their thing is not fake actually it does work it's actually pretty interesting it's a neat trick not a full-on tether i'm not sure how useful can this be for a jailbreak but yeah after a reboot i didn't need to press the blizzard application and to jailbreak myself it jailbroke right after reboot pretty cool not a full-on tether it doesn't have code sign bypass it doesn't have you know persistence but it can run the jailbreak automatically after reboot which i do believe is pretty neat so while apple tried to actually patch this they didn't really patch it they basically just took it out of the sdks so it's pretty interesting it can still be done so yeah that's basically it guys thank you for watching it's basically a pretty interesting project it can be pretty useful though i'm not sure how useful it is for jailbreaking in general for you know for the average joe basically it saves you a tap in like a couple of seconds from opening the application and whatever but it's a neat trick that's what i wanted to outline here and the fact that this poor schmucks that got a lot of hate and they they got called fake and all the names possible actually did find something interesting something that really worked which i didn't know about congratulations athena's team it may not be the next on tether of the century but it is code execution after reboot with no user intervention so pretty nice work thank you for watching i'm geosnow till the next time subscribe to stay updated and peace out", "Rqw1Hdez_yc": "[Music] you're not letting me finish and if you don't let me finish you'll be finished okay finish me then [Music] you see what i'm saying you know that's what you want you are you you walk in here with your agenda what is the i want to talk to you about my issues have been here for less than 48 hours and they're already in it with ogi it's really disappointing to see because they've been nothing but kind and supportive of her i mean come on o.g you got to be better than this can i switch sides with you and you stay here the one here said well can you all tell me what y'all talking because i don't even know what you guys talking about and then oh she said you better lower your tone and the girl said no you lower your mother so that was i don't know let me go in here cause they gonna fight look at og making friends everywhere she go and let's just hope that she don't sabotage their lives i clearly had one it's going yes go mia she is not playing well good nia there have been times where you have talked and you have had a tone and i didn't know why your tone was like that okay give me an example tell me when i had another hostile term besides right now nia don't pretend that this is the first time that we have had a conversation about phoebe oh hold on hold on hold on they got history i am blown away when you were brought to me by your friend mm-hmm you were on the phone you were like that i'll that  up let me finish on my fun time hold up hold up last year og hit me up through a friend and was trying to get me to come on a reunion to bring out tea on phoebe i declined because why would i come be your pun and look like a clown for you i came in this group because of jackie who is og like like who she oh lord i can't i can't i promise you i can't og definitely did not mention that she knew nia prior to walking into the house and i'm not surprised ochi can be a little calculated with holding information you never know what she got going on behind the scenes hi my name is nia was desperate to get into the collective so nia decided to offer dirt on phoebe as collateral if i would introduce her to these women i said thanks but no thanks and now all of a sudden she took it even further and said that i invited her to the reunion are you [Music] when i invited nia and nori on this trip i had no idea that nia and og had history first i'm a colorist and now this i just can't if you lie like that that means you've been lying on a bunch of ground here and now it's adding up and i see so coming on this trip i really thought og was gonna be cool i was gonna get to know her even though the things that the other ladies were saying i'm just like i'm not going to listen to them because i got them on my own and i'mma let a person show me who they are but now i see what they're talking about i don't even think it has anything to do with color i'm starting to just think oh gee just has a problem she's just a big bully one lie there goes some other thirsty thirsty real thirsty
