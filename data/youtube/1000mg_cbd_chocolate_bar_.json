{"FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "vKUalt7mcmA": "hi guys I'm back it's Nikki and I have another CBD oil video for you guys today CBD oil CBD products I have tried my first CBD product a few weeks ago over a month ago and I kind of got hooked a little bit a little bit not too much so I had recently ordered another trial of CBD so with all the CBD stuff I tried I tried the vape I tried the gummies I tried the honey and that's it that's the all the CBD stuff I try so out of all those I tried I really enjoyed and felt the most effect out of the gummies it gave me the best effect that I know so that's what I wanted to do I wanted to do a test this is an experiment I ordered two different types of CBD I was just gonna get the gummies but then I decided I saw this syringe oil that I wanted to track that it look so interesting so I went ahead and tried that so let me show you so this is from where's this from I think diamond CBD this is like one of my favorite CBD spots now to buy stuff because they have good promos and they have coupon codes and their stuff that actually works for me with like like it doesn't make me feel weird and it manages pain when I want to have it or I feel good so bubble wrap and box well I got relaxed gummies CBD a few sour bears a hundred mg and a daily boost CBD oil granddaddy purple a thousand 500 mg that's a lot let's just open the gummy seemed to come in these packaging for some reason always comes in this packaging so there it is it's a relaxed sour bears I love the sours I love the sours extreme strength extreme strength CBD a hundred mg's per pouch so 7.25 mg per gummy so this whole package is 100 mg s alright and alright it's it oh so they have take one two three gummies once or twice per day so you could take up to three gummies up to two times a day or as needed alright the amount of time it takes CBD to start working is up to 90 minutes so alright how long does the effect last up to eight hours and this is the other one this I thought was really interesting I wasn't going to get anything but the gummies for the test but look at this this is let me let this let me look at it daily daily high strength daily boost terpenes formulated that has a 500 mg granddaddy purp daily dose fully loaded with approximately 50 mgs of broad-spectrum CBD 18 plus this literally says 18 plus place up to 1 ml under tongue may cause drowsiness okay 1 ml up to 1 ml so this whole thing is 1 ml so you can place up to you can put this whole thing under your tongue Wow so here it is this is what it looks like it's a syringe it's literally a syringe it's awesome so here's a syringe and I thought like before I ordered it I was like wow you inject this and yourself the CBD but actually you don't you inject it under your tongue 1500 mg s 100 mg s it doesn't say how long this will taken it back to but like I said this takes 90 minutes I want to open the gummies up I'm gonna do a testy testy oh oh no unfortunately I'm gonna have to open this whole thing because I knew it it felt like it melted this didn't happen before I don't know if those my fault or their fault but it got squashed melted it melted it melted look at this I'm gonna eat it I'm gonna need half of it half of it should be like right there still taste go mmm maybe I should do um CBD ASMR hard to eat like this should I do this whole thing the recommended dose for chronic pain I like the face ID so I got time it I guess this is 20 mg for chronic leg pain uh-huh I'm to eat the whole thing I'm gonna be greedy I'm scared mmm I'm a candy person that's it's good very fruity I'm almost done I know it's not good to talk when you chew but okay I need to talk I don't want to stick here I'm chewing your face say anything so I'm gonna time it see I feel hmm mind you I ate breakfast it's like I had breakfast at like nine o'clock I ate some Farina like hot cereals that's it it's almost 12 o'clock it's 11 55 ohms so 11:55 a.m. I didn't eat lunch yet but I did eat breakfast so it's not on an empty stomach keep that in mind should I eat it in the morning but maybe next time I can do CVD of an empty stomach what is my syringe sour sour power I don't want to take the whole thing I'm torn I'm scared I don't want to take the whole thing this 15,000 M jeez I'm gonna do this I'm just gonna do this I'm gonna do the whole thing those teddy bears how was the how was it it said think I'm OD'ing this is seriously how 14 I just ate 14 gummies so that was only 100 mg okay sounds 100 mg so if I take this whole syringe that's gonna be how much was this one if I take that package Plus this is going to be 1600 M geez hold on let me look online and see if that's okay punch it 10 mg the CBD your body can only absorb before tea so I guess our body 1 absorbed that as much as what we're taking in syringe myself don't feel too scared there's no reviews no reviews I'm starting to feel something I'm starting to feel something and it's been 5 minutes so I think this thing's kicking in as soon as five minutes with a light breakfast a couple hours after a late breakfast I think I'm gonna do this but under my tongue okay oh oh oh this tastes like um frickin licorice oh I hate licorice mmm I don't like it I don't like it I don't have water Oh put the whole thing squirt [Music] this is disgusting look I did it oh I should've did that one first messed up my lipstick yeah now's disgusting I don't have water nothing nothing so like I said I feel like I felt the hmm I feel interesting I can't believe I did 1600 M jeez okay let's see let's come back in an hour I'll come back in an hour and update you on how I feel I think right now I'm going to do my fashion Nova on bagging unboxing so if you want to see me do fashion noma like right now I'm gonna in this video and I'm gonna do my unbagging of the fashion Nova that I bought if you want to see me do fashion Nova I'm bagging on CBD then I'll put a link down in the description boom I'm starting to feel it already I'm gonna go ahead and do my fashion Nova I'm bagging and if you want to check that out and see me unbag on 16 mgs of CBDs then be my guest I'll be right back in an hour and update you on how I feel in the meantime okay bye see you later whoo hi okay so guys it has been an hour and a half exactly an hour-and-a-half 90 minutes so I started taking the CBD gummies at 11:50 okay I started feeling it a hundred milligrams I started taking that I started feeling it now actually I took the gummies I took the gummies at 11:50 a.m. and the whole pack 100 milligrams and then I took the syringe the syringe thing a hundred thousand five hundred milligrams after that and then five minutes at 11:55 I started feeling something and then starting at 12 o'clock is when I did my fashion Nova I'm bagging video and it just was like I just felt like I was doing too much like I felt like I was just doing too much and I was just I wanted to talk more and be more lively like more like this like you know who I am right now I don't I think I'm just more like mellow and just like thinking like what the heck is going on I don't know I didn't even see the video yet but when I post it you know obviously you can check it out check it out if you want you don't want to that's fine but it was just like I felt like I needed to like lay down and just relax and stuff like that as for pain management I feel like it could do it's like could do pain management thing I you know I took like 1600 milligrams so I personally didn't have any pain really but I don't want to give myself pain so I don't want to give myself pain to just see if I could remove the pain so I just documented how I felt so is that it it could get taken to effects up to ninety minutes I guess it depends so for me it took an effect anywhere from five to ten minutes that's how fast it's such an effect for me with the light breakfast a couple hours before so it's like two hours before I had breakfast and then I took this and then I did feel something I hated I hated this syringe I really hated this this tastes disgusting I'm still have it in my mouth like the flavor it's like an earthy and earthy licorice I hate licorice I really hate it I'll never get that syringe again but um thousand oh but I do like the gummies even though it melted I really did enjoy it and that was it it's been an hour and a half and it said it should last for eight hours after this I guess I don't know I feel okay you know I'm still here I've been taking that much I'll you know like I thought I was taking too much I was scared if you see before but I'm better now so guys I survived 1,600 mgs of CBD edibles and I feel ok I feel good after an hour and a half I go back to normal I guess towards the hour mark I started to feel normal so let's say five minutes I started to feel something then 10 minutes hit me from 10 minutes to 30 minutes or so maybe 40 I was just like in like this height of the moment and then like after the hour mark I started winding down from feeling a certain way and then an hour and a half I'm back to where I was before and it's supposed to be still in effect so like I said if I had any pain I guess I could give me more like information but I don't so I guess if I have pain I pray I don't but if I ever do I will try this to see how it manages the pain that's it I don't know if this was any help to you but if

this is so interesting or if not just like I don't know just thank you thank you so much I'll see you next time bye [Music]", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "UosMa2FrQHI": "yo what is up guys it is your boy anthony and i'm back in the gym i hope everyone's having an amazing day or night wherever it is that you are from we're back with

nap um i think i rated the [ __ ] edibles and eight just because i don't like chocolate but the [ __ ] were fired and i sure was a dope ass high i should smack man that should be this bad um [Music] in the beginning it's like a cool ass like brush you know you get to laugh you get the giggles you're just chilling you're vibing and then once you just like start settling down you just relax dude you know you just calm down you just i think a fat ass nap dude i just [ __ ] knocked out feel good now i feel relaxed i'm calm chilling um but that edible was [ __ ] fire not even a lot i should really did smack all right guys it is currently the next day and i just wanted to pick up the camera i was just showing you editing the video and i wanted to give you guys a little bit more i wanted to give you guys a little bit more insight on to how much the [ __ ] wonka bar is smacked now that i'm sober and clear now that i can talk to you guys right and [ __ ] clear minded but yesterday i did not smoke all i had weed wise was that wonka bar and i was [ __ ] vibing and satisfied that wonka bar satisfied me throughout the whole day i did not want to smoke nor did i need a smoke i was just gone the whole day um so just to give you guys a little run down throughout the day i took the [ __ ] edibles at five o'clock and after taking the edibles we went to the store and that was like an hour and 30 minutes in and by then i was already feeling something um but it wasn't like an uncomfortable feeling i was i was vibing i was laughing it up i was just laughing it up chopping it up honestly like i just was laughing at nothing and felt like laughing at nothing um and three hours into the edible that's when i was really really feeling it in my head and i was just like [ __ ] i'm so blown and you guys seen my face at 10 41 when i picked up the camera on the last clip i was ready for bed i was so gone um i was just so blown i was ready to knock the [ __ ] out and literally that's what i did after that after picking up the camera and i hadn't slept that comfortable in it in a minute let me just tell you that edible had me out like a [ __ ] light um but i slept like a baby last night and i don't know if this is just me but me personally i don't realize how high i actually was until the next morning i obviously recognized that i'm high in the moment but the next morning i woke like this morning there was this morning this morning i woke up and i was just [ __ ] gone dude i felt so groggy and lagged um but it was nothing bad you know um i love being relaxed me personally i'm a relaxed person so it was just a good feeling for me you know i was just calm i took a fire ass shower and i was just now i'm just vibing dude um but yeah i know i gave the edible a 9.5 but that's just used to give an understanding of how [ __ ] dink it is but that was just my opinion go try it out for yourself or if you guys have tried it out already let me know down below um but literally i was satisfied with that [ __ ] wonka bar throughout the day and i hadn't had any [ __ ] edibles smack that [ __ ] hard you know that's gonna the wonka bar is on top of my list and then

It's Melena at Remedy Review,\nand today I'm gonna be trying Rosebud CBD chocolate. So, Valentine's Day is\nright around the corner, and I thought that there would be no\nbetter time than to try Rosebud CBD chocolate for myself. I've actually never\ntried any kind of CBD chocolate before, so I'm really excited to try theirs.\nThere's a hundred milligrams of full spectrum CBD in this entire bar, and it's\ndark chocolate which is my personal favorite so I'm very excited to try it.\nAnd even the top of the box right as you open it says things are about to get\ngood so let's hope so. Oh, this is super cute\nand it smells really good, too! Smells just like any regular dark chocolate\nthat you would get, and I think it's adorable. And now for the best part of\nthis video, I get to eat some chocolate so... oh yeah tastes just like any other\nregular dark chocolate there's no like cannabis or hemp flavor which is great\npretty much just melts in your mouth. So, yeah I'm definitely gonna be buying\nanother one of these bars for myself. That's pretty f---- good but honestly that's\npretty damn good not gonna lie. Oh, wait I think I just got a tinge of like weed\nlike this slightest hint it's gone now but it was like one touch don't know\nyeah I figured at this point that's not making it in there... Just eats the whole chocolate. So, let's\ntalk pricing. These chocolate bars currently cost around $22 on Rosebud's\nwebsite which is a little on the higher end, but they're vegan gluten-free and\nthey really have a luxury feel to them. Plus, they taste great so you can't go\nwrong. And from now until February 14th, you can buy one get one half off on\nRosebud's website so you can buy one for yourself or for a loved one or you can\nkeep both of them which is probably what I'll be doing and just eating them by\nyourself... this s--- is working I swear to God! Anyway, okay, so to wrap things up I\nreally enjoyed trying the CBD chocolate bar. I definitely think it's already\nstarted to work a little bit making these videos it's pretty nerve-wracking\nbut I feel pretty calm now so no trouble! And I would definitely recommend this to\nanyone that wants to try a CBD chocolate. This is the first one I've\never tried, and I really enjoyed it. I'll definitely be trying more in the future,\nalthough I don't know if any of them will really quite stack up to this one.\nAnd yeah I really enjoyed Rosebud as a brand, and you can stay tuned for more\nreviews on their products in the future!", "HtaG8WmgrFk": "three amazing items left hopefully on the dish the dankness here colors pedro sweet sativa hawaii heartbreak pre roll and this shall we WOWY chocolate ten and ten so let's shuffle it that's pretty good shuffle there we go come on disc a dankness give me something good to eat look at that I got it that's pretty good I guess it's chocolate time chowie Wow eat chocolates it's legal edibles here we got this shall we Wow a milk chocolate coming in at a meager ten milligrams of THC but also ten milligrams of CBD so I never get into the CBD I never found any good use for it or anything anyways I thought I would get this just check it out with something a little different because those bang ones I had they were ten so this is a 10 with also 10 of this so we'll see if it actually does anything I have no idea so I'm just reading the back here it's got some little instructions here says the balanced chocolates are made with 10 10 and 10 each piece can be split into two squares to enjoy with friends what yeah right fucking a bunch of people all sitting around on a 10 milligram fucking chocolate bar are you kidding me we recommend starting with just one square but then waiting to feel the effects before having more while you wait you could invent backstories for Street strangers anyway I don't understand what that thing is talking about that's all crazy but it says start with one square and there's two squares or yeah two squares well you know what fuck that I'm gonna start with two bars because fuck that here we go open it up here Nano somebody my tolerance is just way too high so I figure two bars should give me an idea see there's one kind of neat actually not melted which is nice in Alberta right now they had to recall chocolates or something because they're all melting and I can't sell them at the moment which although I guess that would encourage you to make your own and while making their own you'll probably make them way stronger and for way less money so you probably are gonna hurt them so there we go two of these shall we Wow he's you know what should we take a look with a microscope here we go up close on the chocolate with the microscope [Music] that's neat you can see like the grooves you can check them out the grooves where the letters are see that it's getting super close-up on that look at that I'm getting a top-down view right on top pretty cool huh it's going close still cool I guess it's still cool I don't know these things look ok let's break it open OOP looks cool looks like chocolate so yeah I guess I'm gonna have to eat these fucking things and we'll see how it goes okay well here's number one holy that one mm-hmm not bad [Music] hmm nice tasting chocolate very nice tasting chocolate they mean a cool thing no not really though so this will be neat to tell because I do have a pretty high tolerance I make my own cannabis oil all the time and I have it every night I've had it every night for like three months so my tolerance is up there so this would be a good indicator how this stuff is for people with a high tolerance I would say high edible tolerance not high smoking or vaping tolerance but high edible tolerance so I'll be cool [Music] anyways I'll be back need is too of course but I'll be back I'll let you know how this is I'll come back in like 45 minutes or something do like the other ones there I'll check back in in a little bit so it's been 50 minutes and say these things and I do feel a little something but it's so light they almost don't know if it's even anything it's like it's like if you're sitting here and you think you hear a knock at the door so you go over in your check and then you open the door like you look around there's nobody there so you come back and sit down and 20 min 20 minutes later you're like did I just hear a knock at the door and you run over you look again nope nothing there nobody's here so that's what it's like so far for these fucking things and you know how much these cost there were seven dollars and 20 cents each so this is like $15 what it seems like now is like fifteen dollars thrown in the garbage because this stuff is absolutely pathetic fucking shit but I will give it another 45 minutes I'll be back so I'm back here with the spend another hour so I have two hours after I've eaten these fucking things ten milligrams THC 10 milligrams CBD these are seven dollars and 20 cents each so this here is like $15 I pretty much just threw right in the fucking garbage so this stuff here is absolutely pathetic is severely underpowered severely overpriced I'll rarely say this but do not buy legal edibles they're not worth it they're fucking garbage you can make your own stuff way more you can make way more potent stuff for way less using stuff that you buy off OCS I do it myself like I'll put a link here's a link right here check out that that's how I make my oil my cannabis oil and it's way better so much better than this garbage and the funny part is I make it out of my garbage like I make it a vape scraps not even you know it cost me nothing to make it really so what the fuck is the point of these things I have no idea I don't think I'm gonna buy any more legal edibles maybe I'll try the candies the gummies I haven't tried those yet but anyways that's it for now two things left on the disk of dankness you like checking those out and I hit the subscribe button and the the Bell there it'll tell you when they come online but for now that's it for the whatever you call these things these cherry pieces of shit absolute garbage anyways see you later have a good one everybody", "GshuNm0rvkM": "what's up i'm with my buddy connor here and he is going to eat 500 milligrams of thc not only is it thc but it's delta 8 thc which is federally legal and you can currently buy it in 42 states online shipped to your door okay if you don't know who i am by the

recently stopped a little bit ago so it's definitely gonna hit the car like a train but we'll see what happens i don't really eat edibles ever so you've never eaten edibles i have before like once or twice but never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up dude he's gotta wait 40 minutes yeah no he's gonna get [ __ ] up it's 500 milligrams dude fun fun dude i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get some water hey can someone get this man water all right they're saying no man they don't want you to drink it all right homies aren't looking out for you huh oh we gotta do that landscape that's good well let's get oh flip the camera hold on tell me when to alright so go like this and then do it you know like just take the camera okay one two three go dude you gotta flip it man okay okay okay one two three go okay we flip okay so connor just the results are just bad he just he got so [ __ ] up and uh it just didn't feel right filming him he puked so we were gonna do like a one-hour check-in and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself and just only take one or two you hit the link down below and try it out for yourself and if you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "UgDQ0zsfvVY": "what's up guys thank you guys so much for the feedback on

"NCVBujyWvyE": "hi my name is coupons in this video is for mature audience so you better be mature if you're watching this today we are celebrating a thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is let's let's see we got here [Music] we got a nice big old Glover here let's see how it looks [Music] oh that's thick [Music] not nearly enough holy [ __ ] [Music] take us amount of

Rogan experience gotta get off the CBD oil man his mess around your brain man you can't be too relaxed right yeah that's CBD [ __ ] it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time yeah I never realized it was doing what you said yes I was more achy than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

you watching me and I appreciate that something that doesn't mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like going right there and pushing that subscribe button then what kind of like make my day um today though let me scoot up a little bit today though oh oh in recognition of Black History Month and I just don't know if you know this time black uh I wanted to show off my dope shirt I'll show that later but anyway today we're going to review something that people have been asking me to review they've been asking questions about and what it is is CBD gummies I have some CBD gummies here and they are from tsunami these are from tsunami they are 1000 milligrams CBD gum is watermelon range then we that should get a good look at those 1000 milligram CBD gummies these aren't the wonderment of ranks like I just said and they aren't amazing I wanted to I've actually had this for about a week I want to live with the product for a while and try it and also give it to someone else to try and I wanted to see what the effects will be not just pop one in front of the camera because gummies take a while to kick in but these are they're 100% pure CBD gummies they are made from isolated I'm gonna read what it says on the label here it says grown extracted and refined within the United States I'll tsunami CBD products adhere to only the highest possible production standards during extraction we remove all other elements of the plan including TAC terpenes trichomes and other chemical compounds our CBD isolate then undergoes a unique refining process resulting in the purest form of CBB available each batch we produce is independent independently lab tested and the results are available to view by scanning the QR code on the label and this is the QR code it's gonna be right there on your dummy's now as far as how to use these these are fifty gummies that's in this package right here and it says they are 20 milligrams of CBD per dummy consume no more than two pieces every six hours because if you don't it may induce drowsiness you gonna be tired yeah it's gonna be falling asleep if you are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors ma oh I medication stimulates nice to steroidal anti-inflammatory medication under the influence of alcohol if you are pregnant breastfeeding or operating heavy machinery do not take more than two of these in fact I would suggest you only take one because you are going to be sleeping and if you're pregnant of course anytime you're taking anything while pregnant make sure you consult with your physician your doctor or your Midwife monitoring your pregnancy alone with you make sure you check with them first so let's get to it let me show you the dumbest no I am a huge fan of these this is what they look like who in the smell that watermelon smell is so good and the guys are tsunami they've reached out to me and they let me know that their CBD gummies they are infused never sprayed I didn't even know that was a thing that sometimes some companies excuse me some companies instead of infusing their blemish they just take the dummies and they spray them with CBD it's been in the wake of [ __ ] I've ever heard of in my life my mind was blown mind blown but these gummies these gummies are yummy I have a friend that drives uber and lyft and they suffer from back problems because they were in a crash a few months back and the back really aches them it hurts them a lot so I bet them I make a mistake I'm saying mistake cause my gummies is going down but anyway I made the mistake of letting them try some of these gummies and it's not really a mistake I'm just kidding I let them try some of the gummies and after a long night of driving uber and lyft the next thing that gets me a car and was like dude I'm gonna need those yummies what can I get those gummies so I told them to go to tsunami to get them some gummies and that was like well in the meantime in between time let me pull up on you and get some of them gummies so they pulled up on me got a little sandwich bag and put them like five or six gummies in there I mean they were like it really really eased their back pain there able to make it through the night of driving and you know when you're sitting in a car you're uncomfortable that's applying pressure on your lower back it's pressing down your spine is compressing so you drive an uber and lift in the car all night and these dummies were really able to help them I love them they do take about I'll say about I'm gonna say about 20 to 25 minutes is when they started to kick in for me and you can really start to feel the effects you you feel the coaming you feel the calming relaxation feel that comes over you which is a natural and a well-known feeling for me with any CBD products but then you'll start to feel the pain release the pain relief the pain is it it's like you can't really pinpoint the time that the the pain just goes away but all of a sudden you realize that hmm I was in pain and I'm not really hurting anymore it just it's a really soothing thing I love them and the other thing that I look I love the taste they taste good um these are some of like I wish hi I'm not gonna say I wish because they're good I was I was about to say I wish they weren't CBD infused because I would just be eating these gummies like candy all the time but you're not supposed to take to more than two within a six-hour period but I definitely can just eat these like a snack if you know if I was in the mood if I but they're gonna put me to sleep but I love these these are the 1000 milligrams if I'm not mistaken if I'm not mistaken I think this is the middle ground for me I think they come in 500 milligrams this is the thousand milligrams and I also believe they come in the 1500 milligrams so the thousand works for me this is this is this is where I need it to be at 20 milligrams perfect I mean this is what gives me that relaxation feel excuse me and this is what columns the pain in my back for me I'm gonna show you this again but also it is time it's Black History Month let me show you this is dope I'm having a dope short day let me that you get me that you see this shirt we are the grandchildren of the slaves you couldn't kill we are the grandchildren of the slaves you couldn't kill it but anyway up so yeah I wanted to do that let me show you these again like I said I got these from tsunami so you'll be able to go there if you want some that's all you need to know right there tsunami I like it a lot oh let me give me that let me give me a screenshot here that's what you - I don't I never know what they're gonna use as my thumbnail hopefully they'll use this maybe but even right so if you look and put some good dummies I suggest these right here I suggest these tsunami isolate dummies there I mean I don't know what else to tell you is this stuff I like them a lot I think they come in peach as well I'll have to try those patrons I'm kind of cleaning about my peach baby they beat you better be on point but this watermelon is good but would you expect anything else from someone of my complexion then to thank watermelon let's do it no it's amazing it's true I love it as we'd like to say here on smoking legal keep your positive oh well keep it pushing oh thank you guys for tuning in up for my subscribers I love you for my no D gang the

taste better than any chocolate bar you've ever had in the entire yeah now you listen here you listen good yep you comment down in the box below list no was good which ones that you [ __ ] with hate", "n8cpiP_lURA": "and we have an intro and we also have the [ __ ] Road mic going on this time and record there too we're on we're recording alright we're back it's still [ __ ] Friday I'm having a good day i hammered out a bunch of work it's still the a.m. but I got something up next and it's an edible bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang so we're looking at bang chocolates powered by Endeavour indivi just because uninterested let's see let's pull them up on the old Weber site here of course we have the begin age gate day 20 month April and year whatever makes me old enough 1933 enter ok here we go in Devon in diba who knows we don't really care it's just a company it's just a brand sometimes we care I'm not sure about this they're doing pre-rolls they're doing cannabis salt interestingly like Emma the salt it's an interesting one here we got dark chocolates gummies White Russian Bud cannabis sugar okay so I got a variety of edibles let's check out their packaging cuz that's part of it nowadays it's interesting they have for this this is milk chocolate this is dark chocolate the packaging is different sizes that means they just had a whole bunch of packaging lying around they're trying to make it work right they're making it work they're doing it alright so here we go ten milligrams in each bag total THC per unit is one piece one piece of chocolate in here I can see that feel that this one's milk chocolate also one piece let's see their package date this is their package date March 10th 2020 it doesn't even say package date I don't know what that date actually now I'm confused this is the package date it doesn't say package date and then this is the expiry date the date that's in the future that's what makes sense there to me alright package date on this guy is April 6th April 6 so very relatively close I got both milk chocolate dark chocolate to see what the [ __ ] is going on in here do you like chocolate I love chocolate I like milk chocolate sometimes I like dark chocolate ingredients we've got the sugar bittersweet chocolate whole milk powder just a bunch of chocolate stuff I'm not [ __ ] reading that but I do like the expiry date the cookie I had from Aurora I never had an expiry date very weird to eat have food without an expiry date it's open these up alright let's start with milk sugar dark chocolate because I like it less so boom we're tearing that open like that you see and we're also going to there's a childproof sort of seal on here and this is how you open these is a little flap here you want to grab that then you want to open this flap up in here you just pull that side and the shoe opens right up that's how if you're a child don't watch that that's the key to open a hotel group and here we have chocolate it can be broken up into four sections that's what that one looks like let's just bring out the milk chocolate as well so we have it both out here much smaller package on this one even how they have directions on the back of it - how to open children can understand pictures - just let me point that out there and then we have the milk okay bang-bang all right let me get in here we're gonna try this one first let's snap that one snap that one dark chocolate mmm very dark now what I'm looking for is the percentage of cacao usually when you deal with dark chocolate or chocolates - milk cow is there like percentages of cacao so that you [ __ ] know what you're in for once you're so high in in [ __ ] cacao darkness it can be really bitter this is too bitter for me it's cotton it's a really dry chocolate it tastes like nothing but chocolate she's bitter but if you like that go that way let's try the milk chocolate it's not like your just your standard regular old chocolate not like your Easter Bunny milk chocolate there's that's a little better there's a little pop I'm actually quite happy with that good job so ten milligrams per four pieces that's 20 milligrams total between the two bags of chocolate I'm just gonna eat the rest I'm a mix of chocolate and the brook toggle together Laura price right 4:49 great price actually that is some of the that's me a second so four dollars and fifty cents to get 10 milligrams of THC in some pretty good chocolate bang bang on bang on good for you you're making it work so you got some extract and you managed to put it in a chocolate and put it out to the consumers at a good price this is just a regular ol edible and if you're looking to dip your toes you can get as small to 2.5 milligram dose even 1.125 found $1 whatever 1.25 dose - if you want to break those little cubes in half if you wanted to bite that now you've got a one point two five milligram dose great for beginners cool for beginners this is a 2.5 milligram dose when it's broken down but for four dollars and fifty cents yeah if you're just a beginner in a lightweight yeah let's go these are fighting just get more ever give up that's a win I got these that spirit leap bang-bang tasty little chocolates spirit leaf West Kelowna shout out go grout that's cheap especially if 10 miligrams works for you five bucks boom grab - 10 bucks boo boo it's time to smoke some weed now that's it [Applause] yeah chuckle it stop guys stop [ __ ] with the guns [Music]", "3y4TTMbD2tI": "okay so the last time I was sitting here face to face with you guys I was talking about Coco dogs do you guys remember what that stuff was that was a weird chocolate like candy that kind of looked like actual little green dogs in a glass jar if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll have the link right up here in the top right kind of give you up to speed but I need you more recently I actually got something else in the mail and I want to talk to you guys about that because other than the coconuts which are actual candy this stuff you're getting that camera guy this is just CBD stuff and I actually have another packaging tube that helps matter of fact the company of this the acronyms in the name so look at that so this stuff is actual CBD infused gummy candy and unlike the last stuff that I talked about that this stuffs are actually kind of real it's not it's not just like 100% candy chocolate that's made to look like you know a green ugh the stuff in this little plastic jars actually I mean if you want to want to get technical is somewhat of a psychoactive unlike um that that chocolate stuff that I talked about before so here's the funny and ironic part about all of this you know you look at these two things these two jars full of you know it looks like simple harmless can you buy it like the supermarket and you think about the last thing I talked about which was the coconut one looks like something that you could get arrested immediately for for just having a jar on your person whereas this this stuff right here looks like something that you could waltz into any preschool and you start handing them out to kids without anyone batting a single eyeball and that's the funny part about all of this like it's just the way look how innocent this stuff looks it's crazy it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because it will in the state of Florida you got to be 21 at least from from what I recall but actually by this stuff even though it's completely harmless so we got here is uh neon poppers and everyone's favorite sour gummy worms i realistically they both taste almost exactly alike it's just they're different shapes from the shapes and sizes you can I don't know if you're getting that camera move but there are a whole bunch of little smiley faces there don't worry it on ecstasy but before I begin guys I'd be remiss to not kind of show you some one of the basics that you need just in case you guys don't really understand is where it comes from well what it's actually all about so many of you probably know about the stuff but maybe this is your first time learning about stuff like what is it I've never heard of this before CBD is that like LSD is it gonna like make me see pink elephants and ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools so let me explain really quick just exactly kind of the gist about it is got my handy-dandy whiteboard here perfectly by the way before I begin I'm not a medical expert so don't take my advice as I'm some sort of doctor or something yeah I totally left that field I mean I know I have the Asian face and everything but don't be alarmed because I definitely left the medical field I left to pursue a YouTube career where I rake in around $13 a month honestly the age of 40 is right around the corner and I still have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life so for all you outgoing recent high school graduates that are kind of freaking out about the whole real world thing and have absolutely no idea what they want to do yet don't worry cuz my book - way worse so I'd say a majority of you guys watching this video are probably more familiar with THC not too much can be said about CVD like I said earlier and there's still a common misconception about this kind of stuff especially the top of gram of certain psychoactive effects THC as everyone knows is the most active ingredient in the Disco salad this is the stuff that gets you intoxicated or is in simpler terms hi as I'm gonna do my best to try to avoid super confusing medical top of big science Awards because trust me there was a whole rabbit hole science terminology that this can all really boil down to alright so let's try to understand just exactly how THC you know gets you up there by the way before I begin try your best to not be offended by this little placemat behind here just in case you're one of those type of people basically everyone has in their bodies two types of cannabinoid receptors so let's just call these guys CB 1 and then CB 2 THC only binds to one type of cannabinoid receptor or CB so the cb1 receptors are usually found in the brain unlike the nervous system lungs liver and kidneys and the cb2 receptors are usually found somewhere in the union system there actually might be other CB receptors but that's totally not the topic here by now you probably can guess which of the two receptors THC binds to and that's actually this guy the cb1 receptor so THC see th see why not so THC is basically something that activates or stimulates that receptor and that causes like that cool rewarding effect or like that happy feeling that sometimes people get sometimes too much of it in some cases can get you was seeing like really weird like pink elephants magical dragons or like ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools and unfortunately for some people that cb1 receptor can be blocked and that euphoric feeling that many of groans so custom - just really doesn't work out for them but if you're one of the more majority lucky bunch then well Cheers now one like it's a brother ii cv receptor deals more with things like inflammation and pain management you know these can usually be found in like the gastrointestinal system and this is probably why CBD has a potential to help out people with like PTSD anxiety or other types of weird inflammation that goes on in the digestive tract or like around the body so okay let's break it down in a simpler example and this is lifted from green relief by the way they put it this way just imagine you consume cannabis and the THC and CBD are like a whole bunch of keys which are you know and searched for a lock to open those locks being the receptors these guys they click together with the proper key isn't different messages or scent you know all throughout your body so I'm like THC CBD doesn't exactly bind well with the cb1 receptor so really you kind of just almost don't really feel anything and if you really wanted to you have to take way more in the suggested limit but the worst thing that can honestly happen is like a slate rosiness or an insane state of calmness okay back to the talking Asian you really want to be careful with buying some of this stuff because a lot of the people that sell this kind of product aren't really will informing what exactly they're selling you so like last week before I actually got these things and you know the local vape store looking around for you know products that were similar the only reason I didn't is because the prices online are vastly different than what they are on stores they're actually kind of cheaper online to be honest and the stores are a little over there something like this and a store would probably cost you around 70 bucks online these things are like mid 50s or mid 60s so I walk into the store and I'm like you know I'm asking about him you know I'm asking about this type of stuff and I was asking like what's the whole thing about this almost immediately he just goes yeah bro stuff is totally worth the dude I'd like three or four of them and I was like totally gone in like five minutes dude I was I was I was surprised I was I didn't even know what to say you know before I even go in the store I kind of knew what the stuff was it wasn't well it's not exactly the most complicated thing to understand when he when he said he was gone he was like gone like with like 17 E's that's how gone there's this like his description was and I was you know I was taken aback I was no surprise you know so like three or four seconds after that there was like this like dead silence in the entire store and the only thing that I thought to myself was like dude I really hope this guy does not smoke weed because he's probably the first person that'll overdose on marijuana don't go into these stores thinking that you just found like an insane goldmine of like magical stuff because it's it's not it's not it's not that kind of stuff especially if you're in a state that still doesn't have fly solid recreationally illegal because it doesn't matter if you do that stuff and if CBD does get you like that I sure hope you don't take anything with THC unit so yeah this video is made way back in 2019 so I'm sure 10 years from now we can probably take a look at this kind of video and have a good laugh at it considering the fact like how strict the laws were on like you know this kind of stuff especially the ones regarding disco spinach because those right now even in states where it's legalized that's still federally illegal and it's classified as a schedule 1 drug okay so one of the part that probably wouldn't have you fast forwarded to the the actual product I was able consume a good amount of the bag well in the jar in the past 24 hours I didn't exactly read up on the recommended dose but I guess I should have since this was sort of a hefty sized jar at 300 milligram over 1000 1000 milligrams total so according to the little jar thing here it says that it's approximately 72 pieces you guys can read that there so thousand milligrams 72 pieces you do the math what's a thousand divided by 72 so you're looking about 14 milligrams per little candy thing well this guy this one's I think this I think there was a I think there's more gummy worms was there this had 142 pieces this is the smaller so if this stuff is still closed this has 72 gummy worms in here Oh this one had 148 smiley faces so 1000 divided by 148 okay so about 7 grams 7 milligrams of CBD and you show these little smiley face gummies usually the recommended daily doses I think it was between 15 to 25 milligrams for the stuff don't quote me on that I'm sure everyone's body chemistry is a lot different so in order to affect someone else it could vastly depend on like your size in your weight so my guess is the gummy worms here that have yet to be consumed will be a little bit stronger so I have to eat these in moderation because these guys on the other hand I kind of was just popping in like candy I forgot this was a CBD candy thing like I actually started eating them like as if there were something from like the candy aisle at Walgreens so you pop these in your mouth obviously consumer eager and they literally it's candy there's no hint of like you know when you have like the actual edible stuff from the other stuff you can get a taste of the good stuff this Kandee complete freaking candy so those a bit skeptical at first and how this helps with certain problems like anxiety and pain and you know while I didn't really have the laddering his idea was something that was pretty salient especially when driving around like the state of Florida some of you know me and the majority of my content in this channel is usually you know automotive related useless content right now while I've totally loved cars I absolutely despise driving on public roads that's that's a given fact I love cars but I hate driving and again I live in South Florida so this is kind of known as God's waiting room this is a place where older people move after they've realized that they're too old for other old people they hung out with but you know here's the thing it's not just the elderly which which are kind of terrible at driving a majority the people that drive here I feel like more than half of them have gotten their driver's license from a happy meal and because of this driving around in the state of Florida it kind of puts me on a weird edge the things I can definitely say that this stuff helps me out like like immensely I can't tell you how how much this stuff actually kind of works especially driving it gives me the nice reliable feeling that I'm not gonna get sideswiped by like a Corvette every 13 seconds anybody comes in a whole different types of forms you can get it as popcorn tinctures like something you can drop into say if you don't want any candy if you're someone that's trying to lose weight don't want to delve into the whole unhealthy candy eating process you got chips even got like CBD beef jerky and so they they put CBD and like act like a lot of things nowadays and I know this might be a totally unpopular opinion but I think edibles of anything is the most safest and best way to consume any type of whatever the help no matter what anyone says I think the whole inhalation of smoke and everything really messes with your whole body chemistry you know scarring of the tissue and the lungs and all that weird stuff so hopefully guys this was able to give you a sort of introduction of the whole alternative world of CBD let me know in the comments below it sure not only helped me but it helped anyone else that's trying to you know figure more stuff about figure out more stuff about this stuff other than that guys I got nothing else for you if you guys wanna help support my channel or visit my website it got merged stickers hats and other things literally out here calm and click everything yeah I don't I'm not a very good salesman I just had to say that at least the bare minimum I'll see you guys in the next video in the next vlog in the next whatever peace [Music]", "wZfWq1ji9PA": "hey everybody I'm CJ with med Tara CBD you just purchased the thousand milligrams CBD medal tissue I'm gonna give you a brief rundown and show you how to use it it is important to notice that all of the droppers inside of the tincture bottles have graduated measurements to help you with your specific survey when full east java contains one milliliter of total liquid one milliliter of 1000 milligram oil is equivalent to thirty three point three milligrams of CBD we suggest you start with one full milliliter placed directly under your tongue and hold there for at least 15 seconds before swallowing wait 45 to 60 minutes to see for desired results have been achieved if you need to consume more it's okay there's nothing a psychoactive included in this product it usually takes people 2 to 3 days to understand what serving is best for them on behalf of everyone at Med Terra we would like to thank you for purchasing our product", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "tQvZcmtJXUg": "look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar recently i've really gotten into making my own edibles from concentrates i've gotten from the dispensary you guys have been asking me to make youtube videos about some of the recipes i've made so today i'm going to show you the easiest one i've learned so far today we're going to be making medicated chocolate bars it's extremely simple and that's why i wanted to show you this method first all you're going to need is a chocolate of your choice mct oil or coconut oil and either distillate or rso today i'm going to be using distillate but both will work the same for this recipe you can use any form of extract as long as it's been decarb some equipment you'll need is a heat safe bowl a pot a rubber spatula a pyrex measuring cup some measuring utensils a plastic syringe you can find these in most pharmacies and then you'll need a mold for the chocolates if you don't want to do bars you can do molds that look like anything you want there's stars there's bears you can really get creative now the amount of chocolate you use depends on how potent you want your chocolate bars to be the more chocolate you use the less potent your edible will be today i'm using a granite distillate that has about 830 milligrams of thc in it and i'm going to be making two chocolate bars so each chocolate bar is going to have about 400 milligrams of thc i'll explain how to calculate how potent your edibles are a little bit later on in the video but for now let's get started making our edibles first thing to do is fill your pyrex measuring cup with water and put it in the microwave for about two minutes after that two minutes is done take out your now hot water and drop your syringe of distillate in that water this is to make the distillate more of a liquidy consistency so it's easier to mix in with the chocolate you do not want to skip this step distillate is very thick if it's just been sitting in room temperature but now we're going to set up our double boiler by getting a pot with a little bit of water not too much you don't want the water to be above where the bottom of the bowl is going to be sitting on top of it bring that pot to a boil then turn it to low while topping it with your heat safe bowl the heat from the steam is going to be our heat source and now we're going to add just under a teaspoon of mct oil mct oil or coconut oil supposedly helps speed up the digestion process of an edible allowing you to feel the full effects quicker you let the mct oil sit for about a minute let it get nice and warm before you add your distillate and now we're going to take that distillate out of the water and pour it into the bowl just look how easy it is to squeeze out of the syringe it's going to mix perfectly now stir the distillate with the mct oil let it all get mixed together and now we're gonna add our chocolate i'm using just under two and a half ounces of milk chocolate here it melts easier if you break it up a little bit mix it while it's melting and make sure your stove is on the lowest possible temperature you do not want to burn the chocolate keep stirring until it's liquidy and now we're going to fill our syringe and transfer the chocolate into the molds you don't need the syringe but the syringe makes it a much cleaner process and since the chocolate is medicated i want to waste as little of it as possible so i feel like the syringe really helps with that this process takes a minute but the result is worth it i put a little cutting board under the mold to help them keep flat this especially helps when you're transferring them into the fridge and make sure the molds are filled completely nobody wants airy chocolate you can bag and shake the molds a little bit to help everything even out once the molds are filled you want to put them in the fridge for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes you want to transfer them to the freezer for about another hour and now it's time to enjoy got my molds fresh out of the freezer right here you guys gonna show you how good these look don't want to break it it's nice and frozen so typically they're not going to break on you oh yeah look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar bust out the second one oh yeah holy crap you guys that looks like a professional chocolate bar my plan is to cut these in half to their 200 milligram squares i feel like that's a little bit more of a realistic dose i've done this before and gotten a little bit more creative this is like a cookies and cream bar i used white chocolate and oreos since i used oreos i had to use a little bit less chocolate so i used about two ounces of chocolate to get two chocolate bars here's another one i've done where i added marshmallow and graham crackers to it so it's like a medicated s'mores bar all of these chocolate parts were made from the same strain with the same batch of distillate and the same amount so in theory each chocolate bar should have the same amount of potency and that's kind of what i was shooting for here i just wanted a bunch of different chocolate bars that i all knew were the same potency if you use two different types of distillate or rso and another one one might hit you a little bit harder than the other but since these were all made with the same amount the same strain from the same batch they should be a very consistent high and the reason why i like these little squares is i feel like it makes it easier to dose out a lower dose if a chocolate square like this has nine little chocolate squares in it and has 215 milligrams it should be somewhere between 20 to 23 milligrams per chocolate so i can either have like nine doses of 23 milligrams or an entire dose of about 200. it's super easy to find out how many milligrams of thc is in your edibles it just takes a little bit of math and a little bit of knowledge all you need to know is the amount of product you put in it and the total thc of that product if you're using a gram of distillate that has 80 thc it has 800 milligrams of thc in that gram if you're using 2 grams of distillate that has 80 thc there's 1600 milligrams in that batch so once you find the total thc in your batch just divide that number by the amount of treats you made so if you use 800 milligrams of thc in that batch and you got 20 candies each candy is going to be roughly 40 milligrams of thc this concentrate i was using had 83 percent thc in it so it has about 830 milligrams of thc in the gram personally i like to take a couple milligrams off my dose because i feel like not all of it makes it from the bowl into the edible so that's why i consider these bars 400 milligrams instead of i hope you learned something about edibles and i hope this maybe even inspired you to make your own it's super simple and all edible recipes are pretty easy if you can bake or cook you can probably make edibles and let me know if you guys want to see more edible videos in the future and if so what kind of videos you want to see do you want me to make tutorials do you want me to just consume some edibles here and film my reaction do you want

guys thank you so much for watching my name is jeff peace oh my god that's more fire oh yeah ma'am", "B-ENA-uSDTg": "hello my name is King silverback I hope you're having a fantastic day today is an incredibly beautiful day and today boy oh boy do I have something for you I'm really close but that's okay you know I'm saying it's okay to be close as long as you you know are respectful but if you're in person probably not but you know whatever so today I'm gonna be again speaking on something that I deal with every single day just about at a constant so I'm actually gonna go get a prop another prop for this video one second okay so my other prop for this video it's going to be this right here this is CBD oil right here and a teacher don't worry about my nails I'm about to cut them today I promise because I sometimes I forget like I don't look at my nails every single day I don't know if that's a normal thing I just don't look at and especially because I wash my hand soft and I don't they don't really catch my eye because if you don't wash your hands often then yeah okay just straight up if you see people with dirty fingernails that means that they don't wash their hands very often that also means that they probably don't drink enough water and if they do drink a lot of water and their hands are dirty that's nasty because you know they ain't washed in their hands cuz I wash my hands a lot I'm not gonna show my nails but they're the color they're supposed to be basically I'm sorry that's beside the point but this is CBD oil right here in a container that's how most people may be used to it some people I don't have that other thing some people may be used to like a vape pen thing that people use or a they actually have CBD joints at the CBD shop that I I frequent but today we went in my sister and I and we got something else there but you know whoa that was some gas for my tummy but like for my side tummy I don't know it's weird but it's not my business tell what was gotten but something was gotten and something was gotten for and that is this right here that's why I like CBD shops because they just have good or I'll do it I'll do it like this so my nails aren't you know creeping people out this is what it looks like this is what is called this is CBD chocolate bar is dark chocolate which in this case actually does mean that it's vegan and what I really really like about this is believe there's only five ingredients so there's sugar chocolate liquor which is cocoa mass I don't know what mass means but yeah I looked at every single one of these ingredients up specific and then cannabidiol cocoa butter and soy legend which both of those are vegan and then vanilla vanilla vegan so what I can say is this is wait but it has cholesterol in it that's what's weird wait why would this have cholesterol in it okay so I guess the dark chocolate or the chocolate liqueur is where the cholesterol is from I had no idea that chocolate had or like dark chocolate had that in it but literally all this is is sugar chocolate liquor cannabidiol which is I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong can I bid to you all I figured how they say it they say weird because I saw it on like a or I heard it said correctly whatever but cocoa butter soy legend and then vanilla which all those things are vegan that's all I was confused when I saw the yeah I was weird so this is at least plant-based I'm reading all this and I've looked up all the ingredients so I don't really know but this is vegans but her plant-based I should say plant-based because there's nothing on here saying that it wasn't okay now I'm confused because it says kosher dairy on it okay now I need to figure out what this is I'm so tired of things like this it's like why not just say on there this is vegan this is not vegan but then it says kosher dairy there's no dairy in this oh well I got it for free so I'm gonna keep looking this up because this is weird okay so I looked it up as far as I know this is vegan I've had I believe I've had products before I'm sorry I believe this is plant-based I have had products before where it says kosher dairy on it when there's literally no dairy in it at all like if you I'm showing the the I don't know if you can see it very well but the ingredients are literally right there there's no dairy but then it has the kosher dairy thing right here so I I I downloaded an app to see if it was vegan and they've never heard of it so they didn't say it was vegan but as far as I know it is vegan there's no reason it wouldn't be with these ingredients sometimes it angers me because it's like is it or is it not and in this case I'm going to assume that it is plant-based because I did look at the all the other ones the other ones that they have and they had them at the store at the CBD shop that was that they all have milk in them all those had milk in them that make sense because there one was milk chocolate and the other one was white chocolate that this is dark chocolate very very rarely does dark chocolate have any milk in it any animal milk in it of any sort so and I smelled it as well and it didn't smell and I can't really remember what non-vegan so smell like so I'm gonna try this if it doesn't taste vegan I'm going to just spit it out and move on from that because this was free I didn't buy it because I don't buy things that aren't that I'm not a hundred percent sure aren't vegan like even like my dad will ask me to go get something for my mom or him and I'm not gonna pay for it if it's not vegan so that's that's just me I don't I don't actually pay for anything that's not vegan so you know that's me though this sort of looks like each of these squares is supposedly it's what the lady said 15 milligrams of CBD oil or 50 milligrams of CBD now what's interesting about that is this it's $55 okay for $55 each time you fill up an entire I'll pull it out and kind of show it a little bit better each come on there we go wait do I get it there we go okay each time you fill up an entire one of these things right here wait to that pour over the side now okay each one of these things that you fill up it's 16 milligrams of CBD oil okay this whole entire container contains 500 milligrams of CBD oil okay you understand that right now if you multiply 50 by 8 what are you going to get 100 200 300 400 400 milligrams of CBD oil or CBD whatever for $6.99 in 55 dollars that's not how that works my friend that's not how logic works that it's not how anything works it doesn't make any sense something on my sister got today was 450 milligrams of CBD and guess what it was $12.99 so this was free so I it's it's incredible to me makes sense my dad was kind of like well yeah this is gonna last you a lot longer than this is because you know this isn't gonna last you a month and now they say well I don't know I've had it for three or four days and you can't really tell but I've used a lot of it but it's crazy how much I've used and how like I've used it for the past so it's about Sunday or Monday something like that yeah so I'm just gonna try this right now I'm gonna break off piece of it and see how that works and let's see what it what it tastes like and we're gonna see if it works because as of right now I'm not like really really anxious or anything I'm actually probably the calmest I've been all day let's see it smells weird this is tiny look how tiny that thing is that has a taste to it it tastes like all the dark chocolate that I've ever had it actually doesn't taste as good as a dark chocolate that I have but and I'm comparing it to the Trader Joe's one yeah that's interesting so what I'm gonna do with this is I'm gonna just continue doing what I'm doing come back talk about it if it you know works very well and I'm very calm I'll talk about it um excuse me the help that was inside that I was talking and then it happened you know whatever but regardless excuse me for that but was what was interesting is so I'm vegan and everything but the woman said that people buy this for their children all the time so they'll give their children this piece of chocolate that doesn't taste very good tastes ok but it has that that heavy heavy marijuana taste to it now I've never had marijuana before but I've smelled it before that's what it smells like and when your smell is similar to your taste that was so weird sorry but with the smell similar to the taste I presume so when I taste it that's what I smell when I smelled it before because I don't I don't do any drugs or anything like that and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but this is CBD and what is it derived from so obviously it's gonna add that smell to it and yeah if they say they give it to their the lady there was saying that they give it to their kids and she gave this to me for free because when I told her that this 500 milligrams wasn't strong enough for me she was I oh ok and then gave me the chocolate to see how that works so because she said it one time or that she basically was saying that just about everybody that comes in with anxiety says that the 500 milligrams works for him so if I didn't already say it I learned that they have a 2,000 milligram one of the CBD oil that I do like cuz I like this kind I may try others in the future but probably not this one's vegan this one actually is V and it has the no animal tested or it's not been tested on animals but you can read all that yeah it's not been tested on animals or anything like that and that's what you want with this kind of stuff and yeah so that's basically how that is I'll be back if when this kicks in or if it's already kicked in I don't really now horrible taste has been left in my mouth I'm not a fan of the taste but uh yeah we'll see yeah it's all for now I'll be back in just a second this CBD oil stuff does work it's all about getting the right one for you because like as I was saying this is 500 milligrams and the lady was like this just about works for everybody that comes in here saying that they have anxiety and it works but I need to take a lot more of it if I want it to work work so yeah that's my experience it's my opinion of this stuff and yeah I definitely definitely would say that I recommend this I can't say that it's vegan because I'm not a hundred percent sure about 98 percent sure even though it has the kosher dairy on the back of it yeah it doesn't taste not vegan it tastes like all the vegan chocolate that I've had over the past year and a half two years or whatever so yeah that's all I'm gonna say but yeah that's all for this video hope you enjoyed my name is King silverback hope you have a fantastic day and I'll see you later", "QcDAIaWFbJE": "hello

my girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park I didn't get called by the police but I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "87FgbwgR34E": "hey guys welcome back to the do gross on today's episode I'm gonna show you how to make edible chocolates I'm gonna do pretty much from the start to the finish starting out with infusing butter and enough with a really simple way to do chocolates we're not making it from scratch we're just infusing like baker's chocolate with our and fused butter [Music] well for this batch butter I decided I wanted to go with green crack which is a hybrid strain but it's it leans a lot more towards a sativa side so it kind of wanted a good daytime high-energy kind of butter to make these chocolates with [Music] so I did want to make this butter fairly strong fairly potent and I had two cups of butter and which is basically four sticks of butter and I infused a quarter ounce of this group of cracked flour into the butter with the magical butter machine the first thing that we have to deal with our cannabis is 2d carbon so throw it near oven at 250 ish degrees and spread it out a little bit and make sure it's in there for about 31 well that does is it transfers the THC a and to THC psychoactive property in cannabis so you definitely need to do that before infusing it in the oil little tip if you guys are using this magical butter machine is while your d carbon erat cannabis just throw your like hard butter right into the magical butter machine right now and start it up for an hour on low temperature just so you can melt your butter and then it's ready for the D carb wheat as soon as it comes out [Music] well after 30 minutes in the oven I pulled out all that weed and took it off the stem no need to put the stems in there and ended up having 12 grams of cannabis that went into four I'm sorry two cups of butter all you need to do is just add that right into your butter solution that you have all warmed up and add a little bit of soy or sunflower less at it as well that helps to emulsify and combine the cannabinoids to the butter I love this magical butter machine though it does it all for you adjust 162 hours once everything's in there you are good to go to set it and forget it for two hours [Music] all right so let's talk about dosing that is a thing that's really hard to find exactly the right the right metrics on how to get it I found this website this calculator out there and you need to know the starting material the THC in the starting material I know the screen crack is roughly 20% so that's what I'm starting with and if you're using trim you might not really know what you're getting so this one I wanted to get a more accurate test on on the exact THC percentage per serving [Music] I was gonna be melting down 12 ounces of chocolate and I was gonna add two ounces of the infused butter so I knew that for the 12 ounces of chocolate I was gonna have roughly 210 milligrams of THC that's going to get infused in that entire batch I didn't know the final amount of serving still after I poured it and that's how many the runner and the first one so the first set of chocolates so I do that that was roughly 5 milligrams per chocolate in the first batch all right so after two hours next step is we just have to classify the butter away from all the cannabis material that's left in the bag so there's this bag comes with the magical butter machine which is basically just like a strainer so pour it all in there squeeze it all out get all the butter through hopefully you don't get too many solids that come through with it there definitely want some milk fats that came through but was able to pretty much clarify that out by just pouring it into the jar before I was gonna add that to the chocolates you do lose some starting material as well so even though I went in with two cups of butter I only came out with about maybe a confident corner of of the butter I probably could have done a little bit better like squeezing out more but that was the clearest stuff that I got and that was the stuff I was happiest with so yeah only about 1 and 1/4 cup but off of the two cups of butter I started out just by doing a small double boiler thing you can warm up chocolate however you feel like this I just boiled some water put another pan on top of it in the water and poured in the chocolate chips from there so 12 ounces of chocolate chips and 2 ounces of the infused oil [Music] after that just start for a few minutes want to make sure it's obviously very evenly infinim mixed in they might want to separate a little bit I actually did add a tablespoon of some more lesson to this as well to help with the emulsification of the oil and the chocolate [Music] the first bachelor did two ounces and wanted to see how the consistency was they seemed really good when it popped amount so the second one I was like maybe we can make these a little stronger so I added three ounces to the next batch which ended up being on the dark chocolate chocolate chips that who meld up here [Music] now all that's left to do is just pour them into your molds I use these silicone molds I got off of Amazon I didn't need to oil them at all they pop out super easy so yeah just forms for an ear molds and then right under your freezer only takes about 30 minutes for them to firm up once you have your final count about how many servings you have then you can actually see how many milligrams of your THC is in each serving so my first batch I kind of overfilled a little bit all the way up to the top and I got like 40 for individual chocolates of this semi-sweet stuff with the two ounces of infused oil which was roughly 5 milligrams per serving my second batch the dark chocolate I used 3 ounces of oil actually a little bit more than that and it ended up making 62 I want to say 62 servings so a lot more servings and that's visit and pour in the chocolate quite as much but the THC percentage was roughly the same because I used that more THC infused oil in the whole batch you I have all sorts of different containers and stuff for flour and inedible so I put some of these little ten summons bags and then I'm gonna be leave them in my refrigerator for I don't know maybe a week or so eating them once in a while but also just want to let them dry out a little bit there a little bit moist so yeah leave it in the fridge for a bit and I think they'll be good on the shelf for at least a couple months and that is it I think that is the easiest way that you can make chocolate edibles they're not making any chocolate you're just melting down existing chocolate adding your oil boom done simple as that so it's gonna work for a lot of us that aren't expert cooks like myself and yeah I think these things will be great so check out the magical butter machine if you're interested at all in making infused oils you won't regret it I'm going to post a link down below that you can click as well to get it off Amazon and if you've watched a couple of these videos that though if you subscribed and hung around got more videos coming up about once a week and yeah I think that's about it for now if you guys have any questions let me know until the next time you guys take care [Music] you", "_dOlRs0n-88": "hey everyone and welcome to have been a pan today we'll be showing you how to make CBD infused chocolates so when you think of making chocolates the first thing that comes to mind is just melting a chocolate bar or chocolate chips right while this makes sense for reshaping chocolate or adding condiments like peanuts and almonds to chocolate if you want to infuse happily chocolate the easiest way to do so is by adding in a few butter or oil but by doing so it'll change the balance of the ingredients in the chocolate and just make it less chocolaty and sweet so while this is fine because of how easy it is what if I told you that to make your own chocolate from scratch it only takes three ingredients because that's exactly how many ingredients it takes to make dark chocolate cocoa cocoa butter and sugar you can add in powdered milk to make milk chocolate or take out the cocoa and add in vanilla to make white chocolate but first things first infusing how we have cocoa butter we start off first with decarboxylated an ounce of hemp to convert the CBD a to CBD by gravy and up and then baking it at 275 degrees for 20 minutes after that we use a double boiler we have a pot with simmering water on the bottom and then place our Bowl we have half a pound of cocoa butter in it on top of it so that the water isn't touching the bowl by doing this the ball stays around a hundred degrees and ensures that the butter will be hot enough to dissolve the zpd quickly off the buds and into the butter but not so hot that it'll evaporate tpd or burn the butter [Music] we'll leave this on the stove for about two hours to get all the cannabinoids off the plant and be sure to check the water level of the pot from time to time and add more water if it gets low now that we're done with that I'm gonna let it cool off for about thirty minutes so that's warm to the touch and then strain the butter with the cheesecloth to remove all the plant material [Music] now all you have to do is they'll place it back on the double boiler and add in half a cup of cocoa powder half a cup of powdered sugar and mix until it's smooth if you have a sifter definitely use it on the powders first to break it up more for a smoother consistency and if you don't own a sifter anything similar like a metal strainer will work as well to help break apart the powder now you can pour it onto a foil lined baking pan or any type of mold to give it the shape you want here I have a chocolate bar mold that I'm going to be using with the amount of chocolate I made there was enough for four large chocolate bars as well as a little leftover I poured into a foiled lined baking sheet so nothing goes to waste now you just want to set it for an hour or two in room temperature or in the fridge for about 30 minutes after that they're ready to eat if you're gonna be storing them wrap them with wax paper parchment paper or foil and store them in the fridge and that's it like the content then be sure to check out our beginner's guide to creating CPD products from scratch available at Amazon in print

Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

we're going to be making CBD chocolates and it's an extremely easy recipe but before we get into today's video guys if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much for the support I really do appreciate it and if y'all wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show your support so folks before we dive in to today's video I want to let you know that you will need infuse coconut oil to make this recipe and if you guys do need hemp flour we do have that available and we do sell it and all that information is in the description below go ahead and check it out but you are going to need a fuse - coconut oil in order to make this recipe so go make your refuse coconut oil and then come back and check this out or if you already have it let's get right into it so folks all you need is a cup and a half of chocolate pieces now there are so many different types of chocolate pieces out there we went to the grocery store there was salted caramel chocolate regular milk chocolate dark chocolate a whole bunch of them well today we're just using dark chocolate that's not what you have to use you just have to use some sort of chocolate to make this recipe and then on top of that we will have a quarter cup of infused coconut oil so with that said let's get into making our CBD chocolates okay folks so here is what you need to make your CBD chocolates we have a cup and a half of our chocolate morsels we also have a quarter cup of infused coconut oil we have chocolate molds and we have our double boiler pot over here off camera and we'll get to that in a second so all you need to do is add the quarter cup into the chocolate now for the double boiler thing the reason why I always stick with the Pyrex measuring cups is because you can pour it you can measure everything and you can stick it right into the boiling water and then once it's all set easy to pull right into your molds you don't have to use this you can use just a regular double boiler but this is the technique I like to use so with that being said let at our CBD infused coconut oil to chocolate and get it into the boiling pot of water alright so we're going to add our CBD infused chuck coconut oil with the chocolate now you can see there that there's some CBD at the bottom there you want to make sure you get everything out of there just like we always do alright now that everything is out let's go ahead and add it to the water and then we start melting the chocolate okay folks as you can see we have a simmering pot of water here and that's all you really need you don't need to really boil water the chocolate will melt at this lower temperature so all I do is I put my CBD chocolates right in here and now we're just gonna wait and we're gonna move everything around and as you can see the chocolates already melting because I heated up the coconut a little prior so it just kind of speeds up the process a little bit so now all we got to do is wait for it to be liquid so this is gonna probably take about you know 1020 minutes so I will see you in a few minutes to show you the different stages that you have to wait for in order to get it into your molds alright folks so now it's been about 6 minutes and there's still little tiny chunks of chocolate in here and again guys don't rush it take your time if it takes a total of 10 minutes it's not that big of a deal the last thing you want is chunks of chocolate because again it does not absorb the CBD unless it's melted so make sure that everything is melted we are getting really really close so like maybe in another minute or so we'll take this off the burner and then we'll start pouring it at our mold and one tip I want to show you guys when it comes to pouring your molds take just a regular old cutting board and slide it under your molds because it makes it a lot easier to transport them into the refrigerator so let's give this about another minute or so and then I'll come back and probably start pouring them into our molds okay folks so now is completely liquid and it absolutely smells delicious guys you are gonna love this this recipe is really easy to make and it's a great way to take your CBD especially if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth like myself so what we're gonna do is we're going to try to get as much off the spatula as we can you aren't gonna lose a little bit on the spatula that's okay you can have yourself a little CBD snack a little later and we're gonna put that over here just let it kind of hang out and what I'm going to do is I'm going to use an oven mitt you don't really have to if you have a higher heat tolerance for the glass but I like to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to take this down for a second and we're gonna just wipe the bottom real quick so that no water gets into our mold and then you're just going to start pouring and that's really it guys try to make it as clean as possible the good thing about chocolate is it won't harden up too quick so you should have enough time to get all your molds set and then get them right into the fridge man this just smells absolutely wonderful I am really excited to see how these turn out now we've made this in the past but I'm really excited to use these molds I've used some smaller molds in the past these are typically my gummy molds and you can use your gummy molds for chocolate there's nothing wrong with it so that's over film too much they just did there second one is not nearly as perfect as the first one now this is about 30 gummies so this is about 30 total chocolates see we can get you close on the last one here now he's starting Harding up a little bit so that's where you take your spatula it's now hardening up to a point where you can't pour it it's just it's not that really nice liquidy form that you want when you're making these try to get that a little bit left and the great thing about chocolate is when you make it you can leave it in the fridge chocolate is very shelf stable so is the coconut oil I don't recommend leaving them out because chocolate melts quite easily but it should be fairly shelf stable if they're in a cool area so now they have been poured they're gonna have to sit in the fridge for about an hour probably safer with two hours so I will see you guys in a few hours and we'll take them out of the molds okay folks it has been about two hours since we've made our chocolates and here they are they are all set and cured now again chocolate is shelf stable but if it's warm just keep them in the fridge I like to keep mine in the fridge just because I like them that way you can even freeze them if you like chocolate that way and look how easy it is to pop them out guys that's it and here is what it says on the bottom eat to treat I'm not gonna eat one right now and not because I don't like to eat my own cooking or anything like that I actually don't want to fall asleep it's only 12 o'clock in the afternoon when I'm making these I will have one tonight before bedtime these things are packed full of CBD this is a really good way to get a good night's sleep so I'm gonna take all these out of the mold here they are they look fantastic and they are very very tasty and now this is with dark chocolate but that is all I have for you today folks I really hope you enjoyed this video if you guys need the hemp flour make the coconut oil please check out all the information down in the description below but that's it so I hope you guys stay happy stay healthy leave a comment below if you have any questions and I will see you in another video", "fULtYTDgZgA": "toned as a [ __ ] and go on stayed so Friday

you who are new welcome my name is Amanda and today I am reviewing the Jessie PD gummies this is my first time reviewing a CBD product and this is actually the first time that I've tried to CBD product so let's go ahead and get into it this video I wanted to cover why I was interested in testing on a CBD product and it's because I've experienced a lot of anxiety stress and I have a hard time sleeping sometimes sometimes it'll be hard for me to fall asleep and sometimes it'll just be hard for me to stay asleep I'll wake up multiple times throughout the night and so I just won't get that great of a sleep so I wanted to find a product that relaxed me so I turned to CBD just to try it out I basically just wanted to try to find a product that would help me relax and help me sleep better or feel less stressed a little bit about the just CBD product and brand I saw it on Instagram and so I decided to give it a try if you're interested in trying out just EVD I will leave my referral code or link down in the description box below the product that I got is the just CBD gummies and I got it in the rainbow ribbons they're basically like rainbow ribbon candy gummies with CBD in it I started out with the 250 milligrams size I believe this is a small size they offer but basically it contains about 20 pieces in here each piece is about 12.5 milligrams of CBD and you can tell that I just finished my container and that is why I wanted to do a review about it based on their website it's as adults typically take about 20 to 30 milligrams of CBD and you can up or lower the dosage as necessary so that would be about two pieces of this gummy ribbon but I think the suggested dosage or a recommendation maximum is about four pieces I honestly don't know too much about CBD but I know it does not get you high so you won't feel those types of side effects with this product it does say on the website that it'll take about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect so it just takes at a time once you take the gummy if you are interested in purchasing from the just CBD store or the brand I do want to note here about they do charge a foreign transaction fees so if you can try to use a credit card that with no foreign transaction fees just to avoid that moving on to my experience and my review this again was my first product that had CBD in it that I was testing out and so I didn't quite know what to expect and I started out very slow I started out with a dosage of just one gummy and then I moved on up to four gummies starting off with a taste I think it was pretty decent I love gummies so I was excited to try a gummy product with sweidy in it and it did taste kind of like gummy rainbow ribbons but I feel like sometimes I'm a little bit sensitive to taste so certain pieces I could taste more CBD taste than others if that makes sense it just tasted like something else other than a gummy candy as far as taste goes I feel like I would purchase this again based on the taste it tasted pretty good I could continue eating product like this in terms of how well the product worked however I think that's a little bit of a different story I did start out with one piece and then I gradually made my way up to four pieces as a single dosage I moved up in dosage because I didn't really notice I was getting any results from one piece or two pieces or three pieces so gradually I made my way up to four pieces and unfortunately at four pieces I wasn't sleeping any better it was still hard for me to sleep I still felt stressed I think sometimes when I would take the CBD gummies I would feel slightly more relaxed but I don't know if that was just with SIBO fact or if it was really helping me but overall it didn't really change or improve the quality of my sleep I was still very anxious and stressed out when I slept and didn't sleep any better that I noticed so based on the results that I got from the product I probably wouldn't purchase this again I might try a different product affairs or just taking CBD in a different form but I just want to share my experience with you just to let you know how well it worked for me or didn't work I'm excited to try different types in the future if you are interested in purchasing or trying this out again I will leave my referral and the description box below but I can't personally say that I would purchase this product again if this video helped you please give it a like and don't forget to subscribe for more videos like this I hope to see you in the next one thank you so much for watching bye", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven

marijuana now the candy was unknowingly handed out to more than 60 families at a food bank at the First Baptist Church in Roy this morning the church partners with the Utah Food Bank Fox 13 Sydney Glenn is in Roy tonight Sydney what are police saying about this well let's ask them ourselves right now I am live with sergeant Gwen and they are responding right the second you can see all of the officers behind me talk to me about the latest several children accidentally ingested this candy today yes a little after 3 o'clock this afternoon we were notified that a five year old girl was in the hospital for a THC overdose and we learned that the candy she ingested was provided to them through a Food Bank donation center here in Roy and so what you're seeing now was our officers are actively reaching out I believe it's 72 different families to make contact with them to ensure that we can recover as much as we can make sure those children who have ingested are seeking medical attention so you said to me earlier five children and told so far you have confirmed have ingested there's two of them in the hospital how successful have you been in reaching out to those families so we're looking at reaching out to 72 families and I think so far we've contacted I believe it's 44 families and we haven't been notified of any new victims probably within the last couple of hours let's talk about this huge response that you have right now for something that has never happened here before it's never happened here before and I can say probably for the first time in my career here we've actually called out half the department for an incident such as this you know and it's just a mistake and this is what it turns into you guys learned so far well we've learned so far that we need to be able to respond to these with haste to make sure that no other children are injured or two maybe notify those who aren't aware of what's in their donation that they need to be looking through them probably more carefully to ensure that this doesn't continue and we unfortunately have a bunch of volunteers who are trying to do a good thing and unfortunately this is what a yeah such an unfortunate situation I also spoke with the Utah Food Bank earlier today the CEO says she's just absolutely horrified about what happened the president and CEO of the Utah Food Bank said they were absolutely horrified that this product went out she went on to say she can easily see how volunteers would not have known what to look for a spokesperson for the agency said the THC candy donation came through a bulk commercial donation the CEO of the Utah Food Bank expressed her apologies and said they are changing their procedures to make sure this never happens again so if you are one of those people that did get that THC infused nerds rope you're asked to call the Roy City Police Department if your child has ingested that you should call the Utah poison control we have all those phone numbers for you on our website Fox 13 now calm for now live at the Roy City Police Department Sydney Glenn Fox 13 News Utah", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "op9D2tYVMcY": "Oh golly dokely everyone we are live here on this episode of wheats oh stream offline nope we're back we're back

just me I'm not gonna do it all at once because I'm too much of a coward but we're gonna do the whole thing guys over the course in the next couple of hours here we're gonna get really [ __ ] high together and I'm probably gonna fail spectacularly just letting you know just setting up expectations right now this is probably gonna be a failure I got my braids in my hair I'm ready to go oh I also came in case you didn't notice from the the picture I've got my beard brush here I know right it was really really disappointed with my my beard so I want to show them my grooming techniques and make sure they understand that I take care of this here I appreciate my beard I give it the love and attention it so deserves I even bomb it on occasion beard balm Amish made or something I can't remember it's good it keeps it soft alright well how is everyone doing today um I am nervous as all hell I'm very very nervous about this effin brownie um to give a little bit of history I think this is the third one of these I have done maybe fourth I have failed twice and I have done it once with the wheats co-host the wheats co-host and I split one one time over the course of like 4 hours we both got super high i got higher than he did but there are two failed attempts in the wheats vaults as well of me failing this i appreciate you a mr. Comanche oh I know I can do it I know I can do it too so let's just go ahead and open it right now and let's do a little bit let's just start it off nice and easy you know what so let's not go crazy here okay so yes I fail twice in the past on personal level and I succeeded doing it with somebody else but I got really high just doing half of it so hopefully all this Kanak oh I've been doing recently though is getting me primed because I've been doing a lot of Kanaka reviews and they are potent as hell all right I've got my Arnold Palmer here Arizona tea $0.99 great value great Buy you know just to keep me hydrated over this stream and to help me choke down this brownie because if I remember correctly it doesn't taste very good ah delicious okay so here we are here is our oh [ __ ] all the iciness melted off let's try to scoop it out so that's all the mint icing that should be on it but is it okay guys okay here we go so this is what it looks like pretty ugly I just sort of smeared that icing back on it is remarkably small for a thousand milligrams edible I mean this thing is freaking tiny dude it's um uh you know let's see if ways does it say on here somewhere I don't know it can't weigh more than an answer so super super super tiny and super super potent smells a lot like wheat it does not smell tasty it does not smell tasty at all the mint odor so sort of helps cover it up a little bit but it is not the tastiest or the best smelling there okay well let's go ahead and cut off the chunk here I'm thinking about doing a third to start with there we go so here is the first portion of our Korova 20 dose medical cannabis mint black bar whew that's not good mmm log weed taste to it glad I have this bad boy here rest in peace Arnold Palmer rest in peace it does not taste good Oh God Oh so here's what we've done so far by the way gents ladies and gents we've done about a third or we've chopped off a third of our this brandy I'm gonna finish this third right here tastes terrible really bad wrong we taste light we taste whoa oh my dog just left let's do if we can get a dog back in here dog I've got three let's see which one shows up you dog hey dog Judy new yeah all right we got a dog gonna get waiting for this brownie take effect oh that taste Doug took my headphones off buddy story about that dog by the way real quick I don't have side that dog her name's Newt she's a border collie mix smart dog nice dog she's six so she's in her middle ages when we got her we wanted a big big dog we went to the shelter um picked up a dog they actually thought she was a great pyrenees mix and so when we got the dog they're like how big do you want your dog to be and I said I wrote on the little formulas like oh I don't know 50 pounds and this woman laughs she's like this dog is gonna be way way bigger than 50 pounds so I was like oh man I knew I wanted a big dog but I was a little nervous I was gonna get something huge well rest assured she weighs 25 pounds they were way way wrong about what she was she's no great pyrenees mix she's a she's a border collie Mike's very very very different kinds of dogs but we compensated for our second dog and we got a great day about as big as you can get okay so the first third of that brownie is down now we play the waiting game which is getting high got to wait for myself to get high that's the thing about these live reviews is yeah you just have to kind of wait for them to come on so let's talk guys let's get I got the gift of gab we can talk about any questions you want you have questions I've got answers I can talk about dogs I can talk about wheat I can talk about edibles I can talk about physics I can talk about astronomy I can talk about cosmology I can talk about oh geez anything you just you just let me know oh that brownie still tastes terrible dude still tastes terrible okay let's talk about about edibles guys I'm gonna tell you what kind of edibles and companies you need to be purchasing what you need to be looking out for and things around the country so the cardinal rule I have discovered with edibles thus far guys is certainly o Washington Post Alert here we go mimimi North Korea the North Korea threat isn't keeping many Alaskans awake at night I'm worrying about moose not missiles thanks Washington Post that is a shitty thing to update me for I thought we were gonna get some like real announcements you know maybe North Korea was gonna nuke us here on the west coast or something what dosage do I recommend for beginner edibles great question Camacho now Camacho my question to you is what do you mean by a beginner do you mean a beginner like you just started smoking or have you been smoking for a while and want to move into edibles because there's a very big difference there I would say I mean I would still start small either way but if you've never if you're like a beginner smoker if you're a beginner just in cannabis in general you basically want to stay at the absolute lowest dosage if you've smoked before you can go ahead and go up to something a little bit more potent so let's say you're a seasoned smoker mister Camacho or miss Camacho I don't know I don't want to impose either way if you're a seasoned stoner you could probably start moving in edibles okay good good good good moving in edibles I would say go ahead and start with in what part of the country do you live in because if I would give you some recommendations for actual products if you live on the west coast some good beginner ones if you live in Colorado or something all their products are different excuse me Colorado all the products are very different and I don't the names but I would suggest that you start with chocolate bars Oh Mississippi ooh ouch ouch ouch ouch I mean no offense the Mississippi I know Mississippi happens to be oh oh you have been Callie oh you live in California okay I'm sorry um yeah start with a chocolate bar grab a bang bar or a kiva and just go with a piece of that for your first go so like if you live in California grab any of the Kiva's I think they actually sell them in 60 milligrams grab one of those eat half of it that'll do you if that's your first time as an edible 30 milligrams from kiva that'll get you feeling pretty good I guarantee it so yeah I'd start with that maybe bang bar bang bars come in 120 180 and 240 I would stick with chocolates I Dana III I would I would respectfully disagree with you gummy bears i I just don't find a lot of good gummies out there for me but they are lower potency I find so maybe you will like the gummies more I'd stick with the chocolate because it's just more the chocolate seems to always be more consistent so I would grab a chocolate bar beg borrow or kevo lowest dosage you can find and start small you can always us you can always go up you can never go down on dosage so yeah I would go ahead and grab yourself a akiva or a bang bar that you can find start with the half of the smallest dosage you can find and then I'll get you right where you want to be probably but rest assured mr. or mrs. Camacho yes chocolates are super super blissful uh it really just depends everybody's gonna respond to edibles differently that's sort of the crazy thing about edibles some people you know even the lowest dosage even for the most seasoned stoner is gonna put them in bed and some people I have seen who you know don't even smoke that often seem to be impaired to all edibles I've got a friend who can eat a 500 milligram Kanak oh and barely feel it I mean to me that is you know that's nuts to that that puts me in the hospital just about some it really just depends but I would stick with you chocolates lower dosage to begin with now if you guys have done edibles before and you're looking for recommendation what is that I don't know what that is but I would love to know if you can tell me so guys um if you done edibles before and you're just looking for the best of the best of the best of the best out there well Korova little crew who were reviewing here today is uniformly excellent um almost all their products are great all the products are great in terms of potency some are not as tasty as others oh oh okay oh well look at that mr. mr. sing I did not know that that's really cool um like sort of molecular lean there are molecular similar to THC sort of like the molecule is similar is that how that works the more you know really I had no idea they go together like peas and carrots chocolate and THC sakharova guys core biz excellent all their products are great in terms of potency except stay away from their salted caramel blondie if you don't want to puke cuz that thing tastes disgusting I'm sorry Korova if you see this video and I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings but your salted caramel blondie really does taste terrible and you should just not make that product or tweak the recipe cause it's gross it's gross it's gross gross gross it's gross it's gross it's really gross it's so gross okay but this but most of their stuff is really good some of it is actually delicious a lot of a lot of their their edibles actually if you're a first-time STONER stick with their 150 milligram anibal's oh my god that Saturday morning breakfast cookie or my favorite edible ever the or my one time favorite edible ever we're gonna have to talk about canna Co the ginger chew oh my god guys if you like molasses cookies or ginger cookies the kirova ginger chew is a [ __ ] great cookie [ __ ] everyone ever amazing edible what's up ace everyone has different taste buds yes we do all our tongues are different we all have different taste receptors in different places but it's not at all like we were taught in when you're learning about taste buds we don't actually have little spots on our tongues like back isn't salty in front isn't sweet all that it's really more jumbled together in more nuance than that and we were taught in them in middle school you love the salted caramel blondie how dare you that's okay I forgive you for that I I wish I could like it I really do wish I could like it I actually tried it three different times just to make sure I wasn't screwing up and wasn't going to talk [ __ ] about Krupa unnecessarily but I hated it all three times what can you do but I'm glad that you loved it I am glad that you enjoyed it what's my opinion on concentrate bait pens or do you prefer bud I think there's a difference in high and milligrams can that show uh let's see oh and I'm calling you Comanches Camacho Camacho I'm sorry jeez sorry Camacho I like the bait pens I prefer whoa so Dane was letting us know that they sent me percent more tests aside for tested for pests fi pesticides and fungicides which is really a little redundant because pesticide just covers all like insecticides herbicides fungicides that's what pesticide means but that's neither here nor there I always say that because I was briefly worked in an entomology but briefly I worked in an entomology lab studying bedbugs for two years which was a really really [ __ ] up job um kind of gross actually studying bedbugs uh are you my studies am I dreaming nonstop for the next five hours wants to know Katie Katie my twitter is a tweets reviews I think let's check it out and I might be trying to stop stream for the next five hours straight if I don't pass out somewhere along the way and yes Katie my actual friend Katie how are you by the way the Twitter handle is a tweets reviews w ee ATS re v is not that I can't respect or anyone what I did for some people but but I didn't know that about their the Pens that they were tested tested for pesticides and fungicides meaning that I that when they sort of processed the bud the bud had pesticides and herbicides in it is that what that means is that the buds had or that that that had fungicide I don't know that's [ __ ] up I didn't I haven't heard about that but between the two I do prefer just straight-up bud over the pens if it came to the to the ABS are in general under fire for pesticides really I did not know that I mean is it is it because the bud that that the concentrates come from is being hit with pesticides and fungicides or where is there something in the process that they're using pesticides for it oh okay okay that is really disappointing that is really disappointing um do you know uh I wonder if there are any pen brands that aren't jeez those are some pretty harsh chemicals actually um well maybe avoid the Pens for now guys maybe stick with the flower nature's nature's pen but if the concentrates have pesticides I would assume at some point they're gonna find pesticides in the flower because it comes it's the same thing it's just not processed it's not you know melted down with butane or whatever I actually don't know exactly how the process works to to make concentrates I know it involves butane in some way but other than that you had a chick asking you to get a pen I would say it's still gonna be okay to get her a pen amateur hour squared I don't think it's gonna get her cancer on you know one single pen go ahead and get her that pen she's gonna be fine but maybe in the future Arizona half-and-half the way to go oh boy not even halfway guys I'm only a third of the way in dude and yes this is a half and a half Arnold Palmer Oh funny story about my boy learn the Palmer r.i.p I actually thought he was dead already earlier this year I thought Arnold Palmer was who's that golfer that died in the plane crash in the 90s um we're gonna have to look him up golfer Payne Stewart Payne Stewart I think I thought Arnold Palmer was Payne Stewart and on the day Arnold Palmer died I was telling somebody that story like oh I love Arnold Palmer drinks it's too bad that he's dead and they're like no he's not dead he's still alive I was like no he died in a plane crash in the 90s remember that plane that like crashed because everybody in the cabin had depressurized and number has passed out and they could have saved him then it just crashed and everybody died was I going on Palmer was in that plane he was like no you dummy Payne Stewart was on that plane sure enough Payne Stewart was on that plane and that very same day Arnold Palmer died what a coincidence also do you guys know what we call the studies of coincidences we call it stochastic studies isn't that fun if I could go back in time I would be a stochastic soon I think I would study randomness because randomness is about the most fun awesome cool subject that there is I would totally be a stochastic if I could go back and do it all over again or a data scientist or I'd be a number theory I don't know man it's all so great oh it's all so great I need some ice cream to go with that black bar shame you are not wrong that would actually absolutely help get that down what is my favorite strain boring I'm boring Comanche my favorite strain is gorilla glue number four love it love it love it it's smoking all day hurry day grill glue number four pretty basic but pretty wonderful I see you're a fan of the OG Kush and white our fire I've never tried white our fire before is that a sativa we're an indica oh man starting to get warm - I'm not have to turn this a/c on if it doesn't bother you guys too much sound wise Lord ask mercy it's some old-ass hippie in Brevard in Florida well cool um but yes so uh Arnold Palmer died on the same day that I told everybody he was already dead but meant Payne Stewart I think that's who I mean is Payne Stewart some golfer died in the 90s in a plane crash it was really tragic I don't I think the story went the plane depressurized in midair and everybody passed out and basically the FAA knew about it and they wanted to save everybody but they couldn't and they basically just realized everybody was doomed until this plane ran out of gas and was going to crash it was awful um Ben s asked do edibles always hit all at once or you can you spread it out over an hour well what I'm doing is yes amateur hour squared is right it usually comes on much more like a wave it sort of comes over and crashes over you it's not an instant hit like like if you did a dab it's sort of as he's saying it sort of perfectly describes it it it comes on slowly it's sort of crescendos crescendos crescendos and at some point it Peaks and then it comes down nice and smoothly again it is a very very long process too especially if it's the first time doing edibles I mean this the process could go on like six hours or something new but you always don't the one thing I like to tell people Ben is you don't have to do the entire edible at all at once just try a small portion of it wait an hour see how you feel and then go back and do some more if if you're not yet super high so yeah Ben s just grat if you have an edible do a third of it at the beginning see how you feel in an hour if if you're not yet feeling like you want to be do a little bit more and keep going that way that's my advice to you which is exactly what I'm doing here with this giant ice brewing dan says if I get higher I get higher if I space it out over 30 minutes or so but friends of mine like to eat it all at once I when I am NOT doing weeks reviews actually like to spread it out over a good amount of time as well I like to spread it out over probably an hour eating and edible my favorite thing in the world to do is to go to the movie theater grab an edible eat a little bit of a half an hour before the movie eat some during the previews and then eat something during that first half hour and just get higher and higher as the movie goes on [ __ ] incredible especially if you go to one of those theaters that have those recliner chairs oh man that is heaven on earth man I love it well guys I can already uh oops muted myself here I can already feel this brownie starting to hit in we're only 25 minutes in and I'm only eating a third of it but I can already feel it coming in as as amateur hour squared we're subscribing comes on in a wave and the wave is beginning to rise we are a big flowing flow flow abbis back flow is in we're flowing the tightest plug have I ever been one of those restaurant theaters you know I have amateur hour squared and I have been there high before and it is awesome mixed with a little bit of revulsion let me describe why say revulsion because it is so [ __ ] awesome that you're in a movie theater you recline all the way back in a chair you've got people coming and giving you massive mounds of food as a movies playing you've got 32 ounce sodas you feel like a slob but it's [ __ ] great it's so awesome oh my god I love it I would I would I would live in a diner in theater if I didn't feel so bad doing it I always feel I feel bad I feel bad for the server's who have to like take your food out to you in the middle of a movie when everybody's like recline it's got to be weird to be a server and like put food in some somebody state in front of somebody who's laying down at a 90-degree angle that just seems odd to me but I love them I do have you ever been to one amateur-hour squared have you ever been to one of the restaurant theatres there quite a few of them here in Southern California now the more important question though when it comes to movie theaters is have you guys ever been to a 4dx before I have been to them several times before and boy are they a blast the 40x theaters are you should go if you get a chance amateur-hour squared go to one of this restaurant theaters you'll love it but the 40x theaters are incredible so it's basically like turning a movie into a theme park right I know what you're thinking it's one of those theaters with like the moving chairs you're thinking how fun could that be I haven't share that news it's fun it's fun I want to eat a steak and watch a shitty DC movie with IMAX here here sir here here that is the way to do it because all DC movies are shitty well I guess Wonder Woman was pretty good I enjoyed that I thought all the other ones were pretty shitty but Wonder Woman was pretty good alright guys I know we're only half an hour end but I think I'm going to eat a little bit more of this brownie right now so I'm gonna not do a whole third I'm gonna just do a little slice here all right down the hatch oh we're bad real bad okay back to 40 X liters which are awesome not like the taste of that the way they work you got movement chairs so you're rocking and you're rolling during your movie not just up they've got done water that sprays in your face they've got smell-a-vision like legit the absolute stuff oh dude amateur hour squared I got a straight up phobia of milk it's such a rare phobia they don't have a name for it but I'll just go and make one up right now I have lacto phobia let's see if anybody's ever done that before it isn't me I've lacked a phobia yes I have a fear of milk I know what you're thinking that's can't possibly possibly true possibly be true nobody can actually have a fear of milk some hemp milk LEM but do I have a fear of milk dude it's disgusting it comes from the cow's udder it's gross I haven't had milk since I've been three years old I don't even know what it tastes like yeah I ain't assumed it tastes disgusting but I just couldn't imagine drinking it no offense but it's the devil's juice no but it probably wouldn't help me get that done you're [ __ ] with me there isn't there is a fear of milk Galla phobia or lacta phobia I was right it's the fear of milk the fear is developed because of their sour lactase intolerance to lactose or even drinking spoiled meals that taste yucky probably one of those things when I was a child I haven't had it since isn't that [ __ ] crazy that is that is pretty crazy yeah well I have it yeah I've got me some gala phobia or lacto phobia whatever you want to call it so unfortunately I can't drink it um yeah I also have a fear of what else oh Jesus I've got a lot phobias I hope we all do I've got a phobias of public speaking I've got a phobia drugs I've got a phobia dogs I've got a phobia on the Internet I've got a phobia of you know just just about everything but I'm also into exposure therapy so that's why I'm doing this right now um yeah so uh oh god guys that brownie is already hitting I am definitely feeling it definitely definitely feeling it already getting pretty high only a half an hour into you're afraid of horses and dolphins horses make sense but amateur hours squared how the hell are you afraid of dolphins exposure therapy you say yes yes so there's a phobia of milk and a phobia of sour milk a ser phobia is the fear of sour milk I'm afraid of both milks in my life the best prank ever pulled on me actually was I was in college and somebody knew I had this fear of milk knocked on my door hid underneath of it so I couldn't see him through the peephole and then as I opened the door two people jumped out with super soaker stood with milk and sprayed me down it was terrifying there was a good prank I gave him credit for it after I was done screaming yeah I don't have any phobias of dogs kenia's being facetious nor do I have a fear of public speaking dolphins have weird-ass teeth in the right they do have weird a steep and they are known for being amorous with both humans and other dolphins they have made love to humans against their will before yes yes yes yes yes but it's hard to say whether animals are capable of the R word I don't think I'm allowed to say that word I don't know maps got some serious studies using MDMA and exposure therapy to cure PTSD and it's phase 3 FDA trials boy doesn't everybody have some incredible great research about MDMA ecstasy or hallucinogenics being used to Dupre to treat PTSD or depression and how absolutely promising those studies are but we've got a pretty dumb government that doesn't want to fund them and me I'm all for it I think I think we need to be putting more and more money into research with hallucinogenics and the ecstasy MDMA all those kind of drugs in terms of treating PTSD because PTSD is obviously a huge huge huge problem in the United States right now um that's a real fear of dolphin rapes oh [ __ ] dolphins have been known to Wow that is pretty disturbing but is it still our work because I and I don't know it is pretty easy to avoid both dolphins and horses horses you might run into if you live in a crowded city when the police officers come through with their horses or if you live in the countryside but dolphins you don't ever have to see a dolphin in your life if you don't want to unless you're in a third game in classroom and you got a lot of girls with there at least two franc notebooks but that might be the only place you ever need to be exposed to dolphins weird that excellent episode of king of the hill where Hank gets molested by a dolphin one of my favorite episodes of an incredible TV show king of the hill all of you guys need to be watching king of the hill always always always constantly because king of the hill is great I'm pretty sure there are YouTube channels that are just dedicated to like showing live king of the hill let's go ahead and just give you guys my favorite joke of all time from king of the hill I tell this to everybody that I know personally all the time because it's such a wonderful joke you have to know the characters to know why it's funny but if you've ever seen king of the hill trust me you all understand why it's funny so bill is seeing Puff the Magic Dragon in the alley he's going and Hank goes boom you kids sing that song don't you know what it's about and then he kind of looks around for a little bit and he goes it's about a dragon that it's the best joke ever written of all time in the history of jokes I did anybody to come up with a better job than that Mike Judd is a complete genius in that joke is as incredible as ever Dane I am NOT celebrating this year's shroom fest but I would love to I actually just had my first experience on shrooms a couple of months ago I did not do enough of them unfortunately to get where I wanted to be I'm more or less sort of micro ghosts on them I guess I experienced a little bit of something but nothing approaching anything that you could call hallucination I sort of more just enhanced senses enhanced sensory perception I would describe it but I would love to celebrate shroom fest in the future I think mushrooms are a wonderful drug with tons of tons of therapeutic potential if only we could allow ourselves to do it but so far we're not doing it okay guys this is how a my eyes doing are we getting red yet not yet no red in there just yet but we'll get there we'll get there uh three and a half grams is pretty standard for a real trip I actually I wish I had measured it out ahead of time I don't know how much I had done it seemed like a substantial amount but but it I I definitely was not was definitely not high the highest I've ever been Ryan bonds L is well outside like the first four times I smoked which the uniformity is for pretty much everybody the highest they've ever been but outside of that the highest I've ever been would probably be the first time I ever made firecrackers so if you've never okay no I'll respond to you in just a second oh you can make it five hours I doubt it no we're gonna make it five hours but yes the highest I've ever been was the first time I ever made firecrackers I had probably 10 grams maybe 15 grams of dried a big bud big but I used a packs so I had like maybe 10 to 15 grams of a bud it didn't even need uh maybe I don't know a third of that maybe five grams in one firecracker which is a graham cracker with some like Nutella or peanut butter baked in the oven for a little bit with just the vapor but in there first time I made it oh my god I done edibles already - I had done many edibles I mean not an outrageous man I started maybe two months but prior to that I started doing edibles but I guess they just overdid it the first time I mean firecrackers and holy [ __ ] I didn't with a with with my partner and I remember we were on the couch after we ate them and I was like oh I'll go pick up some food so I left to walk to go pick up some food and as I was paying it's when it hit me I went oh [ __ ] it was not like a wave at all it hit me like a sack of bricks which is super uncharacteristic for for edibles but I was in line getting ready to pay and then the ton of bricks dropped on me and I was like I don't know how I'm gonna make it home I somehow was able to pay I think it took me 3 or 4 swipes to get the card going right managed to carry the food back I think it took me five minutes to walk there in about 20 minutes to walk back never made never got the food even in the refrigerator made it to the the couch to where my partner was sort of grabbed at wish where the partner is and then fell asleep for the next six hours and the poor food was never eaten because it went bad because I never even gotten the originator so that was the highest I've ever been the first time first and only time I've ever green doubt so uh Dane says that my first trip was shrooms was actually spot on the allergen spore test is important I feel like blasting yourself on shrooms has been fetishized hardcore that is probably true I was actually really interested in doing it for therapeutic reasons shrooms so I probably went in a more intense than I needed to at the beginning but I didn't end up getting high anyways and yes five grams of a avb which I can now do pretty easily but back then it put me a total couch lock not I mean it knocked me out to be entirely honest mean it I was passed out it was the only time it's ever happened but I did get couch lock oh my god firecrackers me and my friends who rarely smoke at the time makes them for a beach trip we all fall asleep talk wire compete in the middle so I feel like they're zombies with a fire going down the Sun setting my eyes all clear like the beginning of a zombie movie beautifully written I yes that's the way it felt for me too I remember waking up it's like six hours later and still feeling like I was the Walking Dead I'm glad somebody need to put a bullet right between my eyes turn sort of reset everything but yet so first time doing firecrackers definitely the highest I've ever been in my entire life outside of like the first time I was smoking and the first time I was smoking a loop everybody has a similar experience excuse me sometimes those things make me kind of belchy which is a gross work yeah the first time I smoked which is about five years ago now [ __ ] I got I wonder if everybody's experiences are similar to mine time sort of skipped for me that was the my first experience getting high I did get high the very first time I smoked it took like three bowls I smoked didn't feel anything insisted I wasn't feeling anything I was like guys I got a smoke smell this is this is [ __ ] I'm not feeling anything what is this and then just like the firecracker hit me all at once like a sack of bricks I sat down on the couch some community reruns were playing and then I was like why is time on why it's time like a CD from the 90s a scratch TV from the 90s just skipping skipping skipping skipping skipping I felt like it was only present for every other second or so every every other second just didn't exist at that point I which was both a slightly nerve-racking and wonderful feeling that's only the second time I've ever felt that experience the first two times I smoked with the only two times I felt that that sense of like time dilation of time just sort of being all messed up if I had a time fast forward and slow down went on you know in stuff or away in Custer that is good great question how long is this stream gonna last I don't know I really don't I'm already super high I'm let's take a look at how much this brownie I've got through here oh [ __ ] I'm only about halfway through this brownie another four hours and 15 that's a fun schedule oh boy I'm already surprised we're gonna make it through the Bernie that is guaranteed guys we're gonna make it to this but any for sure what happens to me if I maybe the camera will just be pointed you know like at the floor I actually have a futon mattress right over here in the corner for the dogs maybe I just end up on that with the [ __ ] pillow at some point and point the camera at me who knows it's gonna be a real adventure that's all I know is this is just gonna be an adventure you're probably gonna get knocked out of I'm probably gonna get knocked the [ __ ] out on camera I'm almost certain of it I'm going to be down there with this poo emoji pillow crying later and it's all gonna be my fault mine and nobody else's what's taking another nibble a brownie men the longer it stays out the worse it tastes Thank You Arnold Palmer you're my only hope well tastes so bad continues to taste bad all right guys um let's let's move on to a new subject and that is my new favorite company canna Co I've talked a lot about Kanak oh I've talked a lot about canna Co but guys if you have any opportunity to get some canna co-products you've got to try them they're like magic dug dirt they operate on what about almond milk you know I've never actually tried almond milk or any of the different nut milks almond milks soy milks oh well what are the other ones there there are tons of them I had coconut milk well that's the different kind of milk altogether that's not like that's just sexual coconut milk the juice of coconut but uh maybe I should give those a try but I feel like because I have whatever that gala phobia I can go ahead and be afraid of all milk so I'm just gonna say I'm not gonna do any more no almond milk for me either but back to calico briefs briefly guys catechu is ambrosia there it's the nectar of the Gods they are the best edible company running right now for sure in terms of potency consistency and taste I've reviewed out most of their products except for their any of their thousand milligram line which why would you ever do that to yourself I don't think I'll ever review a Kentico thousand milligram I don't need a chemical thousand milligram a 500 milligram as you saw in my one of my recent reviews nearly killed me so I don't think I need to try a thousand milligrams for any reason ever I can't imagine what it would be like that would be the highest I would ever be if I would do one of those and I'm certain it would taste better than the Korova thousand milligram - which hurts me to say because I love coma they used to be my favorite but Kentico has supplanted them and you just gotta go um you just got to go with who you love do I ever baked wax I do I use a nectar collector here are my smoking methods in terms when I smoke the way I smoke most often is I use a volcano which is hiding behind the galaxy back there and that closet I'm a volcano vaporizer numero uno second is nectar collector dabbing from nectar collectors third would be bud fourth would be baked pens I knew them all at different times but volcanoes my favorite followed by dabbing by a nectar collector I find the nectar collector that'd be the only easy way to dab rigs I find too hard like having a scoop and hold and blowtorch all at the same time nectar collector is pretty easy you just sort of like like humming merge style you dip it in and suck it up that was kind of foul but that's the way I love it but I do I do big whacks through a nectar collector but my favorite way to vape is again through the volcano and then you get a bunch of abb as well which you can use to make firecrackers with which i've got some in my freezer right now so yes i do they uh let's see uh guys let's talk about how shitty LOL edibles is i've never had anybody from Ella edibles contact me I've talked to people talk I've had brief interactions with people from Kanak Oh Buddha's best Korova somewhere else I've never heard any from anybody from hello edibles probably because I [ __ ] talked them so much I think lol edibles is a very large brand there seem to be everywhere in Southern California especially like Orange County Los Angeles County area I see them everywhere but largely they just seem to be a scam to me their cereals are pretty good in terms of the cereals they're lying about their potency they say they're 400 milligrams they're not they're like you know 150 or whatever but they're not bad I think I like the baked goods better but other than that all their stuff truly doesn't do anything and it's sad that they persist and get to be in business and that's kind of what I would like to do with wheats is have a little maybe a little bit a sort of advocacy and maybe you guys could go out there every time you go to a dispensary and just say like don't stalk lol edibles in your dispensary because you know they don't do anything for anybody all the comments on my lol edibles would be you seem to suggest that most people don't get high from their [ __ ] um and they seem to be all over the place so unless there's have some really sweet deal with them you know a distributor or something I don't know why they're there if they suck so badly they're so shitty I know when I go to dispense rates from now on if they ever asked my opinion I'll tell them get rid of yellow edibles stock something new put something new in you'll make your customers happier Eldar edibles is [ __ ] who else's [ __ ] Oh gummies in general but we don't need to rehash that yummies are always bad but in terms of just people who aren't good elwell edibles people I feel like need more credits is punch bar punch bar makes really really [ __ ] good edibles and they're small they're discreet little tiny 225 milligram packages I don't see them enough I always see them I think I've seen them at like two dispensaries and I just basing on like the traffic of views on mice on weights they don't seem to get watched that often which I assume correlates to how often they get purchased which is a bummer because punch bar is pretty [ __ ] good and I think they deserve better than more sales than they're getting so punch bar give it a chance okay uh is it time for more brownie I don't know probably not I am already I'm already feeling it I'm this is terrifying this is going to be rough and you have to get something else to drink to finish that - oh boy okay so that's my dog squid he's a border collie here border collie we got him because our other original dog that we thought was a great pyrenees was not and turned out to be a border collie and we realized border collies our ball and a stock so we got a border collie and he comes from an actual sheep farm he was he's an actual herding dog from hurting stock lines so probably not good for an apartment but you know that's the way ours sweet oh say hi buddy yes oh yeah he's a dog have I ever made my own edibles just firecrackers just firecrackers or a Lancaster I'm not talented enough yet to do my own edibles I would like to in the future try to make some my own edibles especially just starting with cannabutter and working from there but I have not yet done that mostly because I find it is I actually find it cheaper just buy edibles then to make your own because if you convert flour prices and buy flour I don't mean the cereal I mean the I mean weed if you convert like weed grammage into like a Korova black bar it's like a Korova black bar has 20 grams of dried cannabis in it it says right here somewhere you might go to see that yes contains 20 grams of dried cannabis you probably can't read that but that's what that says now if you do that math and convert it 20 grams is like almost how much is announced like 27 grams grams in an ounce oh it's 28 grams twenty-eight point three or four grams is it an ounce and an ounce of weed it's like $200 and that Korova black bar has 20 grams of weed of marijuana in it so if you do the math out it would cost a hell of a lot more to make your own Korova black bar than it would - yes but it would be shitty it would be still be so yeah a shake of $45 an ounce of shake can make a pound of Kenna better but it's gonna be shitty better I mean you're gonna have like you know THC content of like 12% or less than that probably and that's you're gonna have to eat a lot of edibles of things that don't taste very good to get you high I assume it has something to do with with government regulations in California which is why edibles are more in a more efficient way I guess of getting um THC maybe you can sell edibles at a cheaper price even though it contains a comparable amount of cannabis in it that you have to sell at a higher price I don't know it's never made sense to me but yeah so the reason I don't really make edibles is it would be super expensive comparatively because again this has almost a whole this has 2/3 of an ounce of weed in it is what there is what Korova is telling me 2/3 of an ounce of cannabis in here which would cost you you know a hundred and twenty dollars or more easily at a dispensary for you know bottom shelf stuff really yes hopefully that hundred milligram [ __ ] doesn't get passed I have not seen anything else about it it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere so I think we're hopefully all in the clear I don't know I hope so because I would be really really sad if that were the case which would have to get up pack up and move to like Oregon or Washington or something where they want to have that cat speaking of do I have many Oregonians or Washingtonians up in this [ __ ] oh sorry I don't mean to say that word damn it up in this chat room they use trim probably maybe yeah I probably because they've got to make it more economical in some way or they would be going out of business because you can't get 20 grams of weed into a brownie that only costs 40 bucks and not go out of business moon bars are official John blaze welcome back John blaze I am feeling blazed myself guys I am getting super high all good we all thoughts in here that's true we all may be thugs for all also slightly woke thugs and we don't like going around saying that word all the time I didn't mean it derogatory I hope everybody knows that but we all hugs in here so all bone thugs-n-harmony I said worse words than I do unfortunately but we all have row young and we can all forgive each other for our past mistakes that's the you man thanks man thanks dude I appreciate that and I am [ __ ] high already and we're only an hour in okay I have half a brownie to go oh boy oh boy okay so yesterday guys I reviewed the cannabis quench or 200 milligrams that was just sitting right there you can look forward to that coming up on a future of you Oh guys here's a fun thing guess how many reviews I have in the backlog if you had to guess how many reviews I have ready to hit publish on sometimes you might notice like the reviews I'm like oh I'm going to go see guardians of the galaxy too and like June 3rd or something and you're like you're seeing that movie really late well I saw it opening weekend it's because I have a big backlog I would love to try a la famiglia candy bars what hey Jon blades what part of the country are you in if I can if I find those I will give them a try so if you if you are on the west coast if you're in California somewhere let me know about work ethic yes that is one way of describing it Dame is a work ethic or it might be a addiction that might also be a socal okay well then I will keep an eye out for love famiglia candy bars because they just say I'm good yes I am probably I mean I'm certainly psychologically addictive in marijuana who is it who could who could be eating this many edibles every day and not be somewhat psychologically addicted a weed not me that's for sure but uh I can stop any time I want no I really can i I often take small tolerance breaks and things that's work yeah I'd like to me well thanks man I appreciate that but yes I I take lunch breaks every now and then guys I hope everyone does it it saves you some money because if you do edibles every day your tolerance level gets hit pretty hard pretty quickly so always got to take those two drinks speaking of tea breaks it's time to uh not take a tea break and eat a little bit more this brownie here we go another little slice down the hatch it's gonna taste so bad who is scary be dancing I don't know who Gary B is I'm gonna Google in right now oh that is so bad Wow who Gary Vee Gary Vaynerchuk is an American serial entrepreneur wartime New York Times bestselling author speaker and internationally recognized internet personality no he's written hashtag asking Gary one entrepreneur something-something question Jab Jab right hook and then Thank You economy it's always like great books I might have to add them to my um one of those to my own audible cue guys I am I should let you know I'm an audio feed not music I never not have when I'm not doing wheats and even sometimes when I'm doing weights I have now air pods in my ears listening to either podcasts or audiobooks I listen to probably I don't know 40 hours a week of audio content through audiobooks and and podcasts just um two favorites this year I just had this question somebody just asked me what my two favorite audiobooks I listened to this year are here's my answer for you guys totally recommend both of these they will blow your minds you will love them you will love them recommend them to anybody debt the first five thousand years by one the anthropologist David Graeber check that book out debt the first five thousand years it is a history of debt it explains debt it talks about debt talks about what debt is why we have debt what what the meaning of debt is how our whole economy is built on the idea of this abstract notion of such a concept as debt and why we believe in this idea it will change your perspective on economics it is truly a book of big big big ideas I load books that are about big ideas not pops out I mean I'm not talking about your like Malcolm Gladwell [ __ ] or whatever I'm talking like your books like you know your guns germs and steals like that that like come and plop down and say [ __ ] it I'm gonna you know we're gonna challenge the status quo here that's what I like in debt the first 5,000 years I think does that with the field of economics love it read it change your change your perspective on on some things so that's my one of my two favorite audiobooks of the year the second so far is a great course from the great course called the story of human language holy [ __ ] I've always been mildly interest in linguistics never super interested mostly because I think learning foreign languages is hard I think it's very hard but I've been interested in the concept of linguistics and [ __ ] me if that course isn't amazing it's taught by a mic McWhorter I think he's an NYU professor in addition to a bunch of other things and he basically just talks about how language came to be and how languages form and how languages die and how languages continue to evolve and how written languages of the weird thing and and most languages has only ever spoken let me give you an example of this of this amazing amazing amazing anecdote from from one of his lectures where he's talking about how animals different animals have somewhat of the ability to communicate but they don't necessarily have language and he uses this story to illustrate it talking about how there are animals have been known to even express emotional sort of release cathartic release at moments of aesthetic beauty and he talks about this instance where bonobos bonobos which are like chimpanzees basically they're like friendly or like chimpanzees that won't rip your [ __ ] face off and not like to [ __ ] each other all the time so that's what bonobos are but that bonobos will go with their troops and hold hands and watch sunsets together isn't that amazing that bonobos will hold hands and watch the sunset I thought it was incredible [ __ ] loved it that's from the story of human language for a mic McWhorter audiobook from the great course listen to it love it love it love it is even doing it any good we'd audio podcasts out there is anybody are there any good like marijuana dedicated audio podcasts like people who talk about marijuana either from a political ethical perspective maybe even from a business perspective or you know I I don't know I don't know of any good a weed audio out there I'd love to hear some if you guys have any recommendations who getting higher oh I didn't even finish my sliver of writing that I supposed to finish so here we go thanks man interesting stuff bro I know I can talk about why I am talking about audiobooks all day that's what I'm doing right now getting dug with high oh yeah okay yes I have I'm a fan of getting dug with high I have a I used to watch it every episode of the video podcast I haven't watched it recently in like the past year or so but I I had there's some classic episodes like the one where Jack Black basically passes out greens out on camera [ __ ] amazing the one where Pete Holmes basically goes crazy love it yeah getting dug with highs great Joe Rogan I know Joe Rogan talks about weed a lot but I don't listen to mr. Rogan but yes but those are fun miami 7 192 asked what is the most milligrams of edible you've had at once and the answer is 1000 i have done a 1000 of one of these in the past at one time but i passed out in that I mean I passed out I just couldn't review it an hour later I was just too high to get in perfect cameraman talk speak of the multiverse yes yes yes yes somebody finally asked me to speak of the multiverse yes oh and Laurel Lancaster saw the reddit post [ __ ] those virgins um I hope they're not virgins and there they had some good points and unfortunately that video did have terrible audio there are actually three videos coming up that also have terrible audio because I switched to my by of one time and forgot to switch audio outputs and didn't even notice that the audio was terrible because I don't actually even listen to these hey here's a fun behind-the-scenes fact I don't actually listen to these myself I have never watched a week's review all the way through I just edit the beginnings in the middles and the ends and put on the little jibber jabbers and the flippy floppies and send it out there so I am barely conscious with audio [ __ ] up and it [ __ ] up like three reviews so they're gonna be three wishing he reviews and unfortunately that was just the one that got post Cerreta wasn't the shitty in the shitty audio as for my beard you know some people some people just don't like a good beard let's you know come see come saw speak on the multiverse so here we go the multiverse is the greatest thing in science that we don't teach to children because if you if we taught the concept of the multiverse to children children would be much more interested in science and they would be much more they would have a much more attuned sense of curiosity and would just want to question everything more because it's so [ __ ] interesting okay first of all real quick recommendation the greatest book on the multiverse is our mathematical universe by Max tegmark professor at MIT isaac Kozma the cosmology professor at MIT buckin amazing book but let's talk about the multiverse there are actually different levels in the multiverse isn't that incredible so all already were a pretty ridiculous thing so there are several levels of the multiverse the first level of the multiverse is the universe that we live in right now we actually exist in a multiverse in this dimension in this universe in our own little back backyard if if you assume through inflation that our universe is infinite do you think that math is the ultimate reality or describes the ultimate reality that is what the book our mathematical universe is all about max tegmark suggests that math is the ultimate reality that the universe is inherently just a mathematical superstructure as a self-replicating algorithm basically as what he suggests and it's incredible oh my god you've got to read it it's so cool but so our first one with the mother versus if we assume that our universe is a internally inflating moobs you know just outwardly inflating thing and I was gonna say sphere but it's not uniform we know that it inflates at different rates at different spots but that means that that there are technically that space is technically infinite right and with an infinite space that there must be infinite replicas that just we can't ever access them so there might as well be multiverse they might as well be a different universe because we can't ever get to them because they're farther than the speed of light away from us they're you know if some things you know so far from us that it's travelling thanks to the universe expanding if it's at a certain point we can never get to it what's expanding faster than the speed of light away from us because it's expanding at the speed of light plus the university is growing is expanding so there these pockets out there in the universe where there are exact replicas of us because if the universe is infinite there are infinite replicas of everything so I'm having this exact conversation just in some other pocket in some other universe and at some other point somewhere right okay that is University number one that is multiverse number one is our very universe contains its own multiverse because it is inherently or it is theoretically infinite or expands towards the infinity and in an infinite space things must repeat and we must be out there in that infinite expanse over and over and over and over and over again so that's level one of the multiverse in our universe but just inaccessible to us because it is expanding out faster than the speed of light from us that's number one level two is the more common multiverse the one that you sort of think of from like comic books the true multiverse the quantum multiverse which is where basically anytime oh [ __ ] how deep do we definitely go here but okay we're not gonna go super deep down this rabbit hole I don't know man I think the multiverse is that the universe has the capacity configure itself into any configuration and the number of configurations is infinite I that's true well we have no evidence of anything past what we can detect right I mean we unfortunately all we'll ever know is what we can know basically right now we're in an ever-shrinking field of knowledge which is unfortunate way of the way that universe works just because things the fact that it expands everything is getting away from us I accepted everything units in our slot you know like local supercluster or whatever so we'll all constantly have a smaller and smaller pool of data to assess from thinking this is all theoretical so the the second multiverse is just the quantum multiverse just just the quantum multiverse guys no it's the quasi multiverse which just means so every time the wave function which the wave function is every time oh [ __ ] guys we don't need to talk about the wave function this is where we get into like Schrodinger's cat right observation observation if you observe something you collapse the wave function and for something to happen you know is the cat or alive or dead that's not actually true that's what's called the Copenhagen interpretation observation has nothing to do with it it's that the cat is both alive and dead because the cat is alive in one universe and dead in the others and it splits it a process known as decoherence barely how much Brandis left I'd say about a third amateur-hour squared and right now you are here the only thing that you missed is the first level of the multiverse expansion explanation we're currently in the second level in the multiverse explanation we've got the third and most abstract to go so the second one again is all about collapsing of the wavefunction boom collapse you know everything splits and that's what the multiverse that multiverse is is every time that a wavefunction collapses which happens you know constantly trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions or times universes are sort of splintering and splintering and splintering and splintering and splintering so that's level two the most common you know the one that you think of like in comic books what do you think of like how dumb DC Comics are and they have like the multiverse and there's like earth two and r2 19 and all that [ __ ] that's kind of like multiverse two multiverse three is kind of what like gained mr. Singh was suggesting which is is do you think math is ultimate reality or describes ultimate reality mr. Teague Marc suggests that math is the ultimate reality and that our universe is inherently just a mathematical structure meaning it's basically nothing but a self-replicating algorithm that it's a big giant computer program sort of that spits out matter bits us we're just we're just bits basically and our universes is part of a mathematical superstructure uh what about the ether plane I don't know anything about the ether plane what is the ether plane John blaze it might be the fourth level the third liberal mother versus guys I might even be too high to talk about right now at this particular section and I might be too stupid to describe it at any better detail than that I totally suggest you just read our is it our mathematical universe is out it's called hold on let me look at the title max tegmark our mathematical universe yes read it you'll love it it's great brains are computers - yes they are brains are computers they are just computers that use a meat to process instead of transistors spiritual planes were thought and energy travel I don't know about the ether plane oh so math is universe and experienced reality is multiverse oh boy wow that is a poetic way to describe that I would have to be a little bit more sober to parse that out to know if I think that's true but it's on its surface it sounds [ __ ] great dude oh my god so math is the universe an experienced reality as a multiverse Wow even if that turns out not to be true you should definitely get that printed on a t-shirt or a bumper sticker or like a facebook mean or something would you rather have your local WNBA team when the championships this year or receive $5 lol sounds legit oh [ __ ] I don't know who my local nth WNBA team is oh [ __ ] Miami says he would rather receive the $5 I think I would rather take the $5 - to be honest not that I'm disrespecting the WNBA I have no problems with the WNBA I well I'll tell you this I disrespect the WNBA just as much as I disrespect the NBA which is to say I don't really care for either basketball I doesn't do it for me I'm not a sports guy to be honest and perceiver implies separation is the universe separate from itself in any way but illusion the universe is definitely not in any way what you and I perceive it to be it is totally an illusion you know created in the [Music] it's a trick of the brain who knows what objective reality actually looks like if you can even say it has a look you know it doesn't color I mean none of the stuff that that that we're talking about our you can perceive actually exist I mean like color doesn't exist color is a real colors just a it's just a trick I mean everything is it's all our brain just you know cobbling together random sensations and spitting out something that we can grab onto and hope to Christ that are we don't you know die in an existential panic so have you ever had any trouble with the law due to pot I have not hallelujah cross my fingers never had any trouble whatsoever I've never had any trouble with the law period so let alone move pot and I hope to continue that trend for the rest of my life man to be good to spoke with you and crack a cool with you too got some good things too you know later fellas thanks John blaze take care of man yeah I'm gonna miss John blaze he's a good guy alright I gotta do some more brownie here we've been one minute and 17 seconds in it does not very few things I mean taste doesn't exist outside the brain you know getting high doesn't getting exist outside the brain think about what getting high actually is it's [ __ ] crazy it's uh once you start getting all existential it's hard to it's hard to you know sort of right that ship once you start thinking about things it's hard to stop god damn I'm high boom alright here we go [Music] Oh now you're very right amateur hour squared those things definitely do this like taste definitely exists like molecules minute know how to know they don't have consciousness but molecules manipulate our taste buds in particular ways that you know make things like taste but it's it's hard to say what it is what you're just perceiving your brain is telling you something that you oh boy that you think is no you're right I mean I'm just gonna say you're right you're right I'm just gonna concede on that one I'm just gonna concede [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it guys I need more peanut butter M&Ms if you see my gumball machine I don't know if you've been watching the wheats videos where it slowly goes down over time I'm out at peanut butter M&Ms and the sad part is those are super balls but they're too big they don't actually you can't actually get them to come out so they're just there they're just decorative they're aesthetic isn't that shitty for all I know you're in an asylum in Boston pretending to smoke a joint staring in a beard of a bearded man and giggling but my brain says I'm watching this stream you are okay so amateur hour squared let me tell you about my favorite I have actually mentioned this in a stream before because it's my favorite topic of anything to talk about and that is you know if you want to get absurdo add reductive I think yeah about any of these arguments and it's the most convincing argument I think for what the nature of reality is and that's the Boltzmann brain do you guys know what a Boltzmann brain is and that is so like you know you could say oh we're all just in the matrix man you know this that and the other but or we're in a computer simulation you know then the earth is the world is nothing but computer simulation you know and that is likely to be that could very well be true and there's no reason to discount that as a theory as something that's insane there is really no reason that we should be discounting that but that's neither here nor there but what's much more likely is that it's not a computer simulation that you have to you know add in a whole other civilization that is you know managed to harness that level of processing power and basically has constructed a universe similar enough to ours that it would be able to replicate a universe kind of like ours bla bla bla bla bla but that you're a Boltzmann brain and that you are simply a collection of you know like sodium and chlorine atoms that have come together in space somewhere for the briefest of moments you know you've quantumly fluctuated together for just the briefest of seconds to have the consciousness and the memories that you have right now and that you've been weak out of existence completely again so meaning that every memory that you had including me saying that you're nothing but a Boltzmann brain is you having implanted memories from just these atoms that have arranged themselves together in space somewhere which happens if you believe in entropy that's the way it works so then BOOM you're a boat and it comes into existence it says oh I have a mother or father brother sister you know I love to smoke weed I'm smoking weed right now I'm watching this is stupid bearded guy talk about weed when I could be doing nothing more productive and he's also talking about Boltzmann brain isn't that weird books right now existence weight gone and that could be your entire life and isn't that crazy and that is probably what you are you're probably a bold one so yes amateur hour squared you probably are just a a collection of atoms that have flashed into existence because that is the easiest thing to imagine is that you're just you know a couple trillion atoms that have arranged themselves in such a way to give you a random pattern of memories that perceive themselves to be a human being on earth with all these things that you know but really it doesn't take much to arrange that because that all fits inside your brain already and we know that through the laws of entropy anything can just sort of flash into existence if you give it enough time things will just pop in and out of existence give it enough time through the laws of entropy so it's easy to think that your memories your whole personality could just be a random quantum fluctuation why did the universe make me a lonely stoner now that's a great question for an existential crisis that is an excellent existential crisis question anybody else get wrecked on 30 milligrams it's been a while since I could get wrecked on 30 milligrams to be honest Ben I would love to be able to get wrecked on 30 milligrams it takes me to get wrecked to get capital W wreck it's gonna take me about 300 milligrams ten times that unfortunately I've got that high tolerance but maybe if I stopped smoking by two weeks then that 30 milligrams are gonna be wrecked amateur hour squared you're not lonely anymore buddy you've got you've got the you know all the other people in the multiverse thinking about all the other news that are out there think you having this same thought right now just send out some cosmic vibes to them like as John blaze would say get on that 8th or eat there plain son and send some good vibes to them and they'll send good vibes to you and I am high-5 hi did I spell that right hig ehh eh that does spell hi that is correct I am probably 800 milligrams in I would say of this brownie so would be do don't do and guess what it's only been an hour and a half so I have eaten most of it probably in the past half hour too and it takes me about two hours to peak and there's still 200 milligrams left guys she's barely even started to get wacky and it's gonna get I'm gonna get so [ __ ] up it's unbelievable what why am I doing this have I ever seen the performance of just one person at Jim Henson's no but I will look that up right now just one person playing even up and strong enough oh wait that's gonna sound really let me wrap this through my headphones hold on I gotta hear this [ __ ] set as default the vise believes Oh before you knew it someone else would think he can do it I can do it making wow I'm watching it right now it's kind of wonderful kind of sad [Music] Wow this is kind of sad it's kind of a bumming me out but it's beautiful people you can say believe me Jim Henson was a cool dude he was a genuinely good guy he was it like he was like a mr. Rogers level good dude and it seems that in in his death he has continued to inspire many man what a good dude who doesn't like good news by the way I saw spider-man homecoming yesterday anybody seen spider-man homecoming yet I was pleasantly surprised I'd say it's the second best spider-man behind the second spider-man it's the second best spider-man behind spider-man -

so many settings and options and variables that you might never need another R T s doesn't that sound wonderful but the most important thing about it is don't ignore the options bells and whistles and doodads it is that that fundamental game play son it is that cord painfully that is so so so so so tight oh it's like it's like if you took an Excel spreadsheet stuck in a blender ground that spreadsheet down in its barest essentials and said you play the [ __ ] son that is what off world training company is and it is amazing is the best spreadsheet simulator you've ever seen in your life

crunchy numbers and just formulas and Oh economic simulator goodness then this is for you if however you like fun and enjoyable things and having a good time and just enjoying yourself and just lovin life and you know having a good time playing a video game and just just just generally just you know just being a just being a good guy and having a good times I would not get off road training company because it's it'll corrupt you it's it's not fun oh that sucks age are you stage you don't tell me specifically but what part of California UN or Northern California Southern California at their party's central California because Korea I know in my sort of area if one dispensary doesn't have it you can usually hop to another and find it so I just wonder if it's more sparsely dispersed where you're at so opera trading company again it is not a game you should play if you like to enjoy video games it's a game to play if you are sort of a sadist okay so alt-tab oh boy there I ain't there it is [Music] [Music] okay okay we're sort of Orange County here in the southern Orange County okay yeah that's unfortunate that wouldn't be delivered there cuz I'm I guess I'm more southern LA County northern Orange County and and it seems to be pretty pretty widely dispersed up here but hopefully it's just a it's just a temporary dry spell and you're gonna get your Korova sent to you soon but if you sage if you haven't if your dispensaries or out of kirova and they happen at canna co if can I could try but I know Kentico is much much less widely dispersed demand kirova I have only ever seen it at two dispensaries I think out of you know like many so unfortunately it's not as widely dispersed as I would like but if you if you even have the opportunity to ask your dispensary if like if they ever like uh what products you like tell them to recommend Kanak oh man because I hate to sound like a show I wish I were showing for them catechu if you want to pay me money to tell people that your products are awesome wheats reviews at gmail.com I'll do it I you know with ethic ethically of course I'll tell people and I'll bet I'll be happy to show for you but I'm happy to show for for them for free for now because their products are that good but done yeah tell you or tell your dispensary like hey guys get some Kanaka products because they deserve the exposure I can't go if you're out there because I know you've been out there before keep up the good work sorry to sound like a shill again okay off world trading company let's just do a single-player let's just do a skirmish boy I can't play this I can't talk about this game right now I'd be [ __ ] crazy dog maybe later because I'm just too high I did try to explain that [ __ ] whoo boof that'd be so crazy happy crazy nuts look how red my eyes are getting oh my god I am getting high and if you have okay keep me focused I got to keep focus to keep focus keep focus keep focus what what uh what what can i play instead what did the kids like they like overwatch right overwatch um so I oh [ __ ] I have overwatch I suck at it I was good I was okay on console but I suck at PC version but I have it I can play overwatch oh god I just have to stay focused I did say I'll probably die so I've got to stay here and I might die guns guns you want a game with guns guns guns guns guns guns guns guns guns okay I can play some overwatch sorry sorry amateur hours squared I'm back I'm focused on focus focus somebody said something about guns that's all I that's the last thing I remember somebody said something about guns smoked a bowl for me man please it'll keep me keep me on the straight and narrow a blizzard app I hope my PC can handle all this action I've got a good I've got a 1070 GPU and my CPU while a little bit older was nice for 2000 what but let me see if I can find out my emphasis alright guys because no one asked I have 16 gigs of RAM an i7 48 23.7 not overclocked even though I could but I won't because I don't know how and I don't care to find out how for now running Windows 10 and I have a 1070 GPU so there you go now you know but my xsplit just said I was experiencing high CPU usage and it also said you suck which I thought was harsh but who knows why it said then maybe maybe it's just uh how much do I have left to eat how much would you estimate Oh let's pull up this camera I need a pump exploit here I would say I have eaten 80% 4/5 if we want to get L least common denominator about it the least common denominator that's not what that means boom overwatch trying to do this trying to do this people like it but it says pause progress will be saved if you exit what's paused you think that's a quarter left Miami Oh God a quarter well I guess that's not a whole lot more than 20% but it sounds a lot worse than I have to eat five percent more than I thought before oh [ __ ] I will eat at all I'm gonna have to get something else to drink at some point so I'll have to like leave the mic for a little bit but I won't end the stream the stream will keep running you'll just have to look at my I believe somebody said Isis ish background which I also thought was a little harsh if a little funny I also think it was a comment on my beard if a little harsh but also a little funny a little uncomfortable in terms of racial politics but still pretty funny I guess but yeah i'ma need some more of that brownies pretty scary to our quarter life because yes I'm officially out of nine I am definitely at a nine already and there's a quarter left and we're only an hour and 55 minutes in whoops let's see wait if the dog would stay I would try it but I don't think that dogs gonna stay the doc said dick not to be shut up I suck I am high off to get something to drink and I'm gonna finish this in just a moment one second let me play play the jeopardy music wangan [Music] oh my god guys now you get to know the embarrassing truth that I was wearing gym shorts the entire time I'm often wearing gym shorts which is really embarrassing to admit out loud better than sweatpants bet that matter better than sweatpants I guess and only because it's hot because if it was cold my probably wearing sweatpants underneath but don't tell anybody that don't tell anybody that don't tell anybody [Music] man I just noticed upon leaving here and speaking to someone else how hoarse my voice had already gotten two hours of straight speaking has done a lot to my voice apparently if I fail out it might actually be for that reason and who knows give them give up on life pants yes somebody understands the true nature of sweatpants that they are give up on life pants but you can only wear my give up on life pants whereas woman I swear I hear traffic coming to this Mike it's Mike getting really sensitive no I'm super sensitive about audio I'm just so sensitive because like those guys were really harsh me really mean that's okay there's nothing wrong with being mean there we go that sounds better I think does that sound better oh all right I've got a half a bottle of diet Snapple peach flavored in some of this brownie left all right here we go ooh Oh my dog's back she just let herself in she's read like that and she just let herself out what a not gonna say it I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna say okay um that was about half of that so I've got about half left to go I'll do that in just a little bit I'm gonna see what's going on with this overwatch game that keeps telling me it's can't load let's try try again who can't get that taste out of my mouth I might have to put up I might give up on life pants because I love that phrase now was that taking from somewhere amateur hours squared give up on my pants I feel like I've heard that phrase somewhere not to suggest that you wouldn't be clever enough to come up with something as good as that but I feel like I've heard that somewhere what the H over watch why are we waiting ah Adventure Time adventure time yes that sounds right oh now ever watch doing something it's de l'ann\u00e9e initializing um what else do we have to talk about we can talk about we've talked about the multiverse already we're talking about Boltzmann brains we could talk about go check it out can I co oh we could talk about a venture time I've seen like the first three seasons of the show and it is remarkable that that is a show for children that that show is primarily targeted at children aliens aliens we can talk about aliens we can talk about aliens we can talk about aliens we can talk about why why why they're the Fermi paradox the kind of scary Fermi paradox which is why haven't a lien x' contacted us or why haven't we found aliens why I mean where don't we know about them because it seems like we should theoretically right because if the universe is as old as we think it is well you know we're still sort of in a young period of the universe you know relatively speaking we're actually a very young period of the universe but it's been around long enough certainly long enough billions of years long enough actually for other intelligent life to have formed in different places in the universe and theoretically if it were possible for that life to come up with some sort of you know interstellar travel what we should have seen them because enough time has passed and enough that there should be enough civilization or enough interstellar aliens out there you know to visit all kinds of periods or spots in the universe because it's theoretically they would be abundant enough because the Milky Way is just that big there are that many stars and we know that now especially that stars tons of stars have habitable planets on them so but why isn't there life out there everywhere what's causing it what's causing life not to be sort of you know abundant in the universe or intelligent life it's kind of a scary thing and there are a couple of big theories as to why that is either they are smart enough to stay away or too dumb to make contact it's the latter that I would be most afraid of the most scary I think the most scarier alternative is that it's just not possible that interstellar becoming like an interstellar species is it's beyond the laws of physics meaning no civilization no matter how intelligent can do it no matter how much planning is involved no matter how good you are it's gonna it's impossible to travel amongst stars in any real way because the limits of physics prevent it from happening that's really scary to think about that's really scary to think about because it just basically means you know we're all everybody's doomed no matter what you know because your stars gonna explode at some point and you're never gonna get out from where you're at so it's a really scary prospect I think - one to suggest if that's why now some of the other ones are basically just that it's sort of like a Star Trek ian prime directive thing right like there are aliens out there but they just don't come into contact with sort of primitive ish aliens until they hit some kind of technological breakthrough and then you know then then you're invited into whatever sort of you know larger Federation or whatever that seems far-fetched to me but who knows maybe there's also the predatory idea what if we're the first yes but it doesn't really make sense for us to be the first Miami that's the problem it's because though it's more than enough time has passed and in conditions would have been more than ripe enough in millions of places in the Milky Way for this exact scenario to have already arisen but seemingly hasn't or we so it just doesn't make sense for us to be the first the chances of us being the first are so so low because the conditions for you know this to have happened would have happened millions if not billions of times already in the Milky Way so it's just like it doesn't seem like we would be the first back with back woods welcome back Dan you know saying I am a lot higher than the last time you saw me here is how much brownie I left right now not a lot I'm and my voice is starting to give after two hours and six minutes my voice is slowly starting to say you screw you buddy screw you for doing this you stupid son-of-a-bitch so Miami to answer your question I don't know it's possible that were the first it is possible but it's very very unlikely and it makes oh nice dude nice gonna have some fun dancing boy sorry I don't know I make dumb noises like that arbitrarily I'm really high as you can tell I'm starting to ramble I mean I've been rambling for a while I'm glad somebody asked me about aliens I can continue to talk about aliens I like why do all aliens in media look like humans you know they're probably if aliens exist they wouldn't look anything like us I mean aliens would keep saying aliens aliens aliens I think what we mean is obviously when we say aliens is intelligent life because I think aliens if but just by the definition aliens like you know life I think we're gonna find that's pretty abundant actually I think we'll probably find life on Mars meaning microbial life at some point or evidence there of that there was microbial life at some point it just seems like life is at least on at least according to the conditions here on earth or the way earth works life is a pretty tenacious thing it seems to want to form I know Mars is very different than than Earth but it wouldn't surprise me if if somewhere we didn't find some microbial life on Mars at some point but but intelligent life is a whole other matter I mean it could be it could very well be true that and this is another theory for the Drake Equation that that we are sort of the first but first and only that we are such in a freakish anomaly like it seems unlikely but it could be true that that humans really are that rare that humans are really that sort of special it would be very scary because it would suggest how utterly precious intelligent life is and you know we're about to destroy it or about to it you know and and that grand experiment I I think here on earth before too much longer if we continue of course but what we don't yet we definitely don't hope that humans that intelligent life is incredibly rare but currently the evidence sort of suggests that intelligent life is insanely insanely insanely rare which is very scary because it means it's utterly precious and I don't think we treat it as such here on earth which is unfortunate very very unfortunate um who would I send bacteria to an earth-like planet would I geo populate when I geo spore a planet of course I'm sure I'd love to it yeah if there was if there was an earth-like planet out there that had oceans and tress you know both oceans and liquid water and terrestrial well just if there's a planet out there that had liquid water simply liquid water whatever and you know in whatever way even no matter what the atmosphere was as long as there was liquid water there you know h2o I would germinate that planet in a second with human bacteria because why the hell not what do you I guess I know that and you know an ethicist might scold me for my calves awareness for how easily I say like oh yeah why the [ __ ] not because I know there are some ethical implications for for doing something like that but it seems to me like you do everything you can that that life is the goal that life is is a good thing and it should be encouraged life should be encouraged when it doesn't you know crowd out other wife or when it doesn't affect you know but but when if a place is sterile yeah I can't I couldn't fathom a reason why not so pangenesis theory meaning that the earth is populated by has been populated by bacteria from an asteroid I don't see why not I mean that's it's just as likely as anything else if that's what you mean I I would I could totally believe they were just bacterial hitchhikers from an asteroid you know that's or you know tardigrades or whatever not even bacteria we could have been more involved in that but that sounds totally valid to me it doesn't obviously doesn't solve the problem of where life comes from it just solves the problem from where life comes from on earth which to me you know it seems like we're gonna get pretty close to that in a lab pretty soon you know we can do it with like proteins and amino acids and things and it seems like you know it's not gonna be too much longer before we can I know that that sounds grandiose that sounds like a bigger claim them than I know that that can be made but but I want to be surprised oh my god my voice is really starting the goo yes it does it does it does oral Lancaster it's not because it's not because I am speaking or getting more high it's just because my voice is it's going out I've just been talking for so long it's been a while since I've it's going Betty it's going I'm I've got an oddly sort of sedate not oddly sedate of course you get to date but my answers to questions have been less have been more sort of [ __ ] I can't think of a good word for it I've been far more serious have been far more sort of senatorial I've been then they have been sort of fun I don't know I am so high our computers or animals intelligent life that is an incredible question it's obviously a semantic question which does not in any way imply it's a bad question no not at all I would say that [ __ ] I don't know I think we'll find out with computers soon pretty soon probably computers do all kinds of crazy things already we're we're probably not far off from singularity like event I would think I I hate to give a curt spot while or however you says last name credit but it seems like the pace of AI growth in the past like two years has been [ __ ] nuts and it is nothing but an exponential growth and what we're already doing is kind of crazy or monkeys kicking in you [ __ ] I know it's just rude but that's good awesome good [ __ ] in California my homeland dog it is only two regular Cheetos out here holy [ __ ] these are hotter than I thought they're gonna be who I'm gonna start sweating oh god I better stop what a mercy I'm a sweater okay oral Lancaster hey I have a confession in this story time Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please Please do not think of me in a bad way in any way shape or form one time the dog you saw right there did get high accidentally she's um 99.99% of the time super good with like food doesn't go after it or anything boy this flamin hot cheetos still hot ooh I thought I liked him Wow gonna have to have some peanut butter M&Ms so what time I hadn't an apple and they left it on the coffee table like the last third of 150ml grandma and it was a cookie and she got it oh no it was less than it was it was she got maybe 20 milligrams total of THC but it was it was enough to make her very high she was very high I felt very very guilty I felt incredibly incredibly guilty when it happened she seemed not to mind too much she drooled a lot she drilled a hell of a lot she's mostly pretty sleepy her eyes were like this then she would sleep then she would get up for a while and kind of like one I'm sort of won our belly rub but not really and it lasted about six hours so yeah I got I got her high ones accidentally please don't judge me I felt terrible it definitely doesn't mean to do it peanut butter M&M mr. cool me down I have never heard that before dancing that is a fun factoid I did not know that there was any anthropods anthropological evidence that dogs were domesticated with cannabis Oh to do some googling later check out some science journals 250 milligrams oh my god Wow how how big is your dog or a lancaster Tony like pounds is your dog well that doesn't surprise me we we've done a lot of things to dogs over the centuries that's why they are the way that they are we've done a lot of cool things but have it's resulted in dogs being the sort of awesome creatures that they are sorry PETA don't judge me for that comment PETA oh it's a little dog too oh [ __ ] I'm sorry buddy hey oral Lancaster do you ever take your dog to Rosie's the dog beach I know it's crazy like that dogs get like benzos and [ __ ] now it's nuts I think pets a dog and cat thanks to Millennials reticence to have children we're spending a lot of money on pets Millennials are and I think you know 20 years now we're going to look back and be like oh my god you're like we are giving dogs you know pills for anxiety and selling them shirts that were supposedly keeping them calm during thunderstorms and blah blah blah lime and realizing how many of these things are just utter scams and just you know complete [ __ ] but who knows right now we're in the bubble oh cool dude yeah I go to Rosie's like I don't know probably 10 times a week or something I've got three dogs got to keep them busy I assume the answer is yes Miami but iose it doesn't really matter because you are the one that can come you're a hundred percent in control of the supply they don't even understand what supply is so they can become addicted and instantly may even kill them that way by with make him go through withdrawals but yeah they can become addicted to like cocaine and I know cocaine I assume opiates - I don't know though because they do all kinds of addiction experiments on different animals including dogs and they get them addicted to substances including squirrels I've heard in from a study I think can get so addicted to cocaine that they will starve themselves to death basically like if you give them a water bottle with a cocaine drip in it they will drink from that like water bottle basically instead of eating even it's so addictive to them that they will just continue to consume the cocaine and forgo eating completely and will eventually even start themselves to death that's how like powerful those substance abuse can be in them or so addiction can be you know humans can control that but but yeah so substance abuse can definitely develop and dogs have I ever popped a SAN no I have never done pills the only other drug I've ever done is mushrooms and I've I think I've told this story once I did it like actually just a couple months ago and did not really get high I just felt my senses slightly heightened I just had I think it was Dana told me that's sort of the optimal first experience but but yeah that was my first and only experience with any other drug I'm not necessary I'm not opposed to other drugs it's just I've always found weed to be more than more than sufficient so far when it comes to intoxicants and I don't need to get addicted to anything else right OS people are M&Ms are delicious that was what was in that other half of that gumball machine notice they're like six left I also have no idea how much money's in there cuz I really did put quarters in there and I haven't taken them out yet no cool how much you know I'm just gonna wait til I can't put any more quarters in I totally agree with that sentiment Dane that is the proper way to think about it I hoped I had gone in prepared for an intense experience but did not get it my first time if the opportunity presents itself to do it again I would not what hesitate a second to do it but the opportunity has just not I haven't really sought it out but it just hasn't come along since but if it does so I'll do it for sure that's the only other drug I feel like I need to do and I'm just I have an intense curiosity about mushrooms just because I've heard that it can do sort of wonderful things sort of wonderful therapeutic things in oral Lancaster I could not even begin to imagine eating a thousand milligrams Kentico and then taking acid oh my god it would be like me trying to come up with a metaphor right now there'd be a difficult for how crazy it would be I'm not sure what I meant by what I just said but oh hi I'm at like a ten yeah like right there I'm definitely feeling it now in the body as well is the head I feel like I guess I am having not the time skipping thing I was talking about earlier but this sort of time sort of slowed down it doesn't I feel sort of separated from from normal normal time it's crazy that holy-shit Joey Diaz two thousand milligrams of edibles he's a large gentleman though right I think so that that to me makes sense that he would he could eat that much but that's still in an insane ight well no even he's look that's two thousand milligrams I mean it would bankrupt you if nothing else II I know he's a wealthy guy but that's like a hundred but 100 by 100 bucks a day yo well he's wealthy guy you can afford that one mine to put the [ __ ] my talking about people Bob doesn't know our day drug habits easy fun Wow what hit harder for you this or they can't go 500 milligrams right now the Kanaka is still winning in terms of the 500 milligrams but I have not yet finished this and I am not yet anywhere near peak I assume it's going to be a close race I don't know for sure I've got one more bite of this to go I'm gonna have to get another drink because I'd pretty much finish this one because this thing is gross and it's getting grosser by the second so I assume by the end it's gonna be a pretty close race what is cactus juice is that a is it a syrup 200 I'm still I'm still blown away by 2,000 milligrams of edibles but yes I've seen Joey Diaz several times on the we talked about it earlier the aforementioned what do you call what what do you put that thing that we call it that we talked about getting dug with high that's right yes said it right by saying it wrong yes yes Wow yeah oh it's mescaline Oh mescaline okay I've never done it I think I would be down I think I wouldn't be down for ayahuasca to possibly I don't know basically anything that can have that has like some sort of therapeutic benefits I would I would be willing to try I wouldn't do anything no opiates ever I want to do any sort of cocaine or any of its derivation 'he's no pills no but mostly I would try I think I would try acid for sure in shrooms which I've done once to no effect really I have heard ayahuasca is gross - I heard you pretty much definitely throw up isn't that the case with ayahuasca that you will throw up that you have to have somebody there who's trained and basically prepares you to yak everywhere and then you're sort of okay just eat rooms in chocolate yeah I'd be happy to just got to find somebody who can deliver the the the goods so Dana have you had have you had troops before I mean I trims have you had ayahuasca before is it and if you have is it quite as intense as I've heard or as sort of revelatory I I'm not sure if you're just knowledgeable or if you are also experienced in these in these drugs the purge oh I said throwing them not the what well not the film trilogy is it a trilogy r--'s well they're just two of them I think I don't know I can't keep straight I think the three purchase and then a great Rick and Morty spoof is good always get that stuck in my head I hope I didn't get those good stuck in your head from Rick and Morty the purge spoof episode when they keep flashing to the whatever Bard is that the purge the bar that makes you purge better or whatever yeah the Virgin experience is mind boggling but after you get the message it's just a nauseating who nas eating sounds terrible 100 cups or so wow that is crazy that is so crazy well guys I am sorry if I am a little slow in the draw here I am intensely intensely intensely it's it's it's sitting in really hard two and a half hours though halfway the more you know rainbow voodoo - because the purge comes from a particular chemical the use of egg whites I wonder how AG whites removes the chemical oh cool you know you're [ __ ] man you really you're a you're quite intelligent about your your drugs you're quite knowledgeable I am I am NOT I am my my my my knowledge lie lie lie or lay one of the two elsewhere see not even it's definitely not grammar about time to finish what left yeah it is guys I might have to leave for two more seconds to go get another beverage and then we'll finish what's left yes okay proteins capture the Tanis the more you know again all right I will go get a another beverage and we will finish this last bit of brownie no I'll just deal with what I've got here folks live I could not agree more Oh Thank You Miami thank you oh that was so gross well peanut butter mmm skip that empty that taste out my mouth ah Dane that is amazing that is so cool um Wow uh if I were still a science writer I would totally love to interview you and write something about you but I don't do that anymore Wow how many states Dane even allow a psychedelic therapist license I assume like two three well men all 100% listen I'll add it to the queue oh I would oh just okay that makes sense there's a singular thing I thought maybe maybe Washington or Oregon but but just California is good enough but that's a wonderful thing that California does III's again I think these kind of uses and the sort of research on this stuff is so so promising encouraging and so helpful to people California Institute oh man I don't even know what CI is is I know the California Institute of Technology but I don't what is them well let me do some googling I've got a computer that's what I'm doing is computing right now I've got a Googler right here ci is the California Institute of integral studies founded in 1968 oh how am I how cool how super cool masters of arts PhD side II Wow I had no idea I had no freaking idea oh okay there are two different ones I was like I was confused there are two CI is wait guys I'm having trouble even navigating my tabs believe it or not Wow Wow as a prescription for depression treatment because that would be wonderful is there are certainly people out there that are resistant to your SSRIs and whatever our older antidepressants are out there and could really use some new treatments that would be really really really cool if MDMA were a prescription for oh so they would be given MDMA and then how would they be like exposed like with this before veterans or or people who are just like any kind of sort of traumatic events and then they try to like replicate whatever the trauma is is that is that what the dye I guess I don't know maybe I'm confused about what exposure therapy is I thought it was like where you sort of expose somebody to what they're traumatized for by or by in order to get them to sort of overcome their let me see exposure therapy oh yeah yeah yeah so you give people MDMA and then have them encounter their feared object whatever without that's cool is that as that how that would work is that you would basically have them do exposure therapy while on MDMA with the idea that MDMA would relax them even further turtle 88 I don't know to be honest I actually don't know what I their this words mean unfortunately if I'm being honest 14 billion dollars a year to PTSD holy [ __ ] is that just like in medical costs or god forbid is that like in also does that include like the cost of their suicides and how that costs affects the economy is that true psilocybin has a high chance of making it worse so if you do expose your therapy with on mushrooms if you're doing the exposure therapy while on mushrooms you could get your symptoms might become worse oh that's that sucks I had no idea I thought I thought psilocybin mushrooms were supposed to be pretty helpful in that case I had always heard it was good for trauma or dealing with trauma but I guess that's a different thing exposure therapy and dealing with trauma are not necessarily mutually exclusive 95% effective holy [ __ ] that's about as good of a result as you can hope for how fortuitous by the way that we had a PTSD and hallucinogenics and expert about treatment resistant depression had to scroll back up to find out the exact title my voice is really starting to go wow I can barely hear myself talk at this point that is true turtle 88 I just did it with several people exact same amount the other two people had a much more intense reaction than I did my reaction was rather tepid in fact it wasn't bad it was just less than I thought it would be Wow Wow a fully 130 people have bad trips in the therapeutic dose and that is referring to psilocybin mushrooms and bad trips are entirely self-reported obviously right like somebody just says like what happened to me was entirely unpleasant and then that is considered a bad trip what if somebody says like oh man it was so weird like you know I don't know I can't say I didn't like it but it was so strange you know like how do you quantify trips is it is it just good and bad or is it a spectrum you can quote that [ __ ] pretty well that clinical literature you have quite the memory for it I'm sorry I'm growing you're so intensely but it's so interesting it's so fascinating I was just I was talking about this before I had any idea what I was speaking to an expert III think it's so fascinating it's really quite cool I am sorry that my voice is going and I am sorry that I am getting even more boring than I was before because my mind is also starting to get quite foggy I'm I would say you're quite immersed in a Dane anybody going for that PhD pretty much has to I am awesomely ripped that's an apt description a very apt description I'm approaching about as high as I've been the only thing that is preventing me from like just curling up and watching Netflix at this particular moment is is my pledge am I ever going to review cushy punch I reviewed one cushy punch turtle 88 just one I found it immensely unsatisfying unfortunately because I think they're quite expensive i will review more because there people have told me that they are sort of inconsistent in potency and i would like to give them a second chance because i'm only give them the one chance so I will review could you punch again but I have reviewed them once before I think if you look somewhere in my upload history you can find it it's closer to the beginning but I have reading them once and did not really like it unfortunately oh wow that would be incredible Oh Miami no I can still do a game stream I I just lost track of everything and believe it can you believe that that I would have lost track of stuff what I was pointing on doing boy I'm just going through all my different tabs that I had opened since starting the stream Gary Vaynerchuk grams in an ounce fear of milk lacked a phobia I am very high game straight game stream overwatch let's see sources they did since that our tree post it was a pretty remarkable thing it was a very nice experience I was with feedback damn you overwatch damn you I gotta close it that bad overwatch I I'm too high to deal with this audio producers not here deal with it either it's just me working overtime producer was like um nope nope I was like I understand I was also like you know it exists and they were like hey I'm your ed and I was all like [ __ ] you I have no idea what I'm talking about yeah producers not here nor does the producer exist if a producer did exist I would not allow pretty sure to be here for this because it would be really boring but there is no producer on weeds maybe there is the behind the scenes of wheats is an interesting shop well I'm glad you found us Miami I'm glad you forgave us for our shitty audio quality on that first video it was an unfortunate video to have posted to our slash trees but you know I'm still glad that it was it was posted I'm really appreciative for everyone that that watched and I'm really appreciative for all the people who gave me tips about how to trim my beard or how to make my videos look like Isis recruitment videos I really appreciate those those comments as well they were they made me they made me giggle because like my beard is big it made me laugh well yes so Miami thank you so much this video was for you is for you because it's still happening somehow it is still happening I'm crazy hi um okay overwatch seemed like it was gonna screw up my audio so that's out I could still try a off-road trading company aka the best video game you've never heard of that somehow only has a 78 on Metacritic even though it deserves like you know a 91 to be really granular about it did say like gonna get really bad and I can just go I don't really understand the the the ten scale that Metacritic has decided to use or the one scale rather sorry it does what's the difference between 92 to 93 I know that's um I know that's a criticism often long but I actually like Metacritic I'm not a Metacritic ater screw the meditators not don't screw anybody everybody should have internal opinions a lot of Western diets contradict dangerously with ayahuasca my diet is very can be described as quite Western yes quite quite Western in fact well I'm glad you find your own animals to be consistent how many how many grams of weed do you think you use in your average edible would you say Dane are using a gram per edible or something more or less significant and are you using high-grade bud or using like shake or something shake shake shake I might have to go get another beverage and I might have turned this AC back on because it's getting warm need the caffeine guys we might have to play that jeopardy music for you again I'll be right back I'll be right back I'll be right back all right I should have turned the AC off while I left I apologize but I am back oh boy it has been nearly three hours now it has been two hours and like 45 minutes maybe two and a half hours since I finished the edible completely the last little bit of it so I'm not at peak high yet for sure two dogs and now joining the party so I anticipate getting even hired I'm sorry that my range of topics has seemed to have shrunk my brainpower is less boy oh boy is is less substantial than once wise not to say that it never had any real oomph but but yeah it definitely has less than it did before I am exceptionally exceptionally high right now I my voice is giving out this might be the only time I have talked for three hours straight in my life not that I've talked exactly straight I there's some gaps here and there so this this is this is more taxing on my voice than I would have thought but I am proud I finished this brownie and I'm not this is not and I'm not saying anything I'm just saying hey rock on guys thank you though immensely thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for sticking around I know this has gotta be the most boring thing imaginable but I really appreciate everybody who is here watching Miami riddle journey without it and you will never prevail but if you have too much of it you will surely fail what is it ooh I like riddles am I going am I ever good at them no am I gonna be good now you bet your ass I'm not let's see journey without it and you will never prevail but if you have too much of it you will surely fail what is it [Music] is it I have not tried that turtle ad I've never actually tried infusing with oils unfortunately I am a oh boy the riddle I have no idea oh [ __ ] I really want to google it but you'll know because you'll see me clicking so I'm just gonna google it and then you can know that I'm cheating I'm cheating I'm cheating I'm cheating I got this wide screen monitor why am I not using that it's ultra wide screen monitor excuse me Ultra wide screen alright riddle time journey confidence I get it now I see I see yes you can have too little and too much too little and nobody will invest in you and you will never invest in yourself too much however and you will be burdened with arrogance and go down like Icarus fly too close to the Sun just use that metaphor earlier today for something else but I used it as not a metaphor but as a story as the story as a metaphor but not the story of Icarus but it I used it now in a matter of fashion boy guys oh we crossed the three hour mark this [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it's been three hours since I first had the Korova mint black bar and it was taste it tasted gross but it got me pretty it got me high and I'm only getting higher this is wheats this is 1,000 milligrams THC it's a lot somehow supposed to do this for two more hours seems like it's gonna be impossible turtle 88 no that's totally fine totally happy to answer that question my favorite oh man I wish I could have shared some I totally wish I could have shared some Victoria gray it would have been it would have been totally wonderful to to split some of this to share some of this burden but it is what it is my favorite edible turtle 88 I really appreciate yes the question great question great question my favorite edible is say the kirova is 250 milligrams s'mores brownie easy-peasy pretty much any of their 250 milligrams products are great though get super super high and I love mo I am sorry that I am barely conscious this is then more laborious somehow both more and less laborious than I would have thought I both thought I would have passed out by now but I also thought that I I have no way of making that make sense unfortunately I am too high to connect those dots make those points intersect but that line ooh and my voice is going out it is going is going going going and I just keep talking about the same things over and over and over again and I really really really feel like I need to do maybe pass out at some point soon that seems like that might be a nice thing to do thinking about how comfortable my bed feels how good it would feel to lie down on it how good it would feel to be on my bed I don't even need to put the covers on I could just put my head on the pillow and turn on a fan or the a/c and just get really really really yeah it would be it would be really nice that's kind of what I would like to do oh [ __ ] very high very high bad Wow it's only 507 p.m. here but I can't tell you how wonderful a bed feel would feel right now just what the softness and the comfort and the sheets like the pillows of the pillows do I think I'll go to space I definitely think I will be in outer space I think I might even be enter some other sort of transdimensional void or something that's what it would feel like to go to bed right now I can't but do you understand how good pillows feel they feel so good oh my god when your head it's like lying on a pillow you just get to lie there and go take a nap and sleep sleep oh man never take sleep for granted do I think I'll go to space oh you were being serious oh [ __ ] I'm so high god I hope so is the answer to that question the answer yes no no my answer is no I think the geopolitical situation is way too volatile right now to ever hope to like let's say the world had continued to pace with Hillary Clinton I'm not saying that Hillary Clinton was wonderful or the perfect candidate or you know about seeing for anything but just what she's not to get political I am so sorry I don't mean to offend anybody politically but I just think that the world is too geopolitically volatile to have the investment required for any real personal space travel whether it be governmental or or through private business to be affordable for for any reasonable rate now I think if the world had sort of continued to pace in the kind of like Obama kind of growth era with you know with with Tesla and Amazon fighting their rocket battles I think that yes I would have gotten into space at some point in my life but yeah I think I think in but I don't think right now the world is in a place where that kind of investment could be made in any in any real way to make it happen excuse me in an affordable way I hope it can happen even for the elite I mean honestly that they'd be fine with me just to have it more common forever you know for for humankind period but I'm not even sure that that'll be the case um shit's bad [ __ ] is very bad unfortunately the world is not in a good place politically and and doesn't look like there's any hopeful signs on the horizon not to be too much of a downer well Thank You turtle 88 Victoria gray I do occasionally participate in meditation or or what what is the the other term for it meditation or and that you know what I'm talking about sometimes they do that thing and it's good I rarely do it high though I don't know why I don't do it I often I find myself needing things more visual oftenly when I'm high like I crave stuff for my eyeballs when I'm very high so meditation would be very difficult for me to achieve wow it would be very difficult for me to meditate effectively because I would be constantly wanting to see something to do something with my eyes so I guess I don't do that that reason but I should give it a try because I bet you're right I bet it is totally incredibly intoxicating and relaxing a hundred k2 hits suborbital flight right now I think well one sub oh yeah several fighters I guess close enough to considering getting into space it where is it 100k I guess I mean is it you know can you can you really just drop if you if you were a millionaire could you really drop a hundred K and go into suborbital space I mean that'd be great that'd be great I totally totally awesome that I I mean I have no reason death that's true and I did not realize it was that cheap and yeah I would assume me we get cheaper but I would still say that a hundred K is prohibitively expensive for him you know 99.5% of well maybe 99% of people for even a once-in-a-lifetime experience but maybe it becomes like maybe maybe become such a transcended things maybe maybe going into outer space become such a transcendent incredible wonderful thing that it becomes the new religious experience and then it does become worth incredible expense like it would be like your lifelong tithe or your trip to Mecca you know the incredible once-in-a-lifetime expense that you make just to to sort of experience spiritual bliss that would be cool that'd be cool if if that if our you know obsession with them spending money on religion religious pump pump a tree and ornament REE where instead invested in space travel that'd be really great if we can sort of just convince people that that those things were equal and it doesn't seem to me like it should be that difficult a thing of course it would be impossible to do but theoretically like because how amazing it would be to go into suborbital space even it seems like it should be such a transcendent experience that it could be you know as spiritually fulfilling as like a a guy who rose from the dead or whatever or you know pick your eye not to pick on one religion but yeah space travel I would love I totally hope one day to be in honor space now it'd be amazing in my lifetime I just don't I do not foresee it happening I totally think we were there but I think we've backslide um unfortunately my voice this this is a hump that I did not I I kind of thought about it like I kind of thought oh man talking for five hours that might be tough but I had no idea just how ill-prepared I was going to be Minh ravaging actually I can't believe how little I can speak at this point yeah Wow Oh guys okay I am starting to feel a little queasy unfortunately and and I might for the sake of not having to cheese yeah I am starting to feel just a little and well I think I haven't eaten enough food yet today with all this getting high I might have to go eat some food or something and and come back unfortunately in that and my voice is is rapidly giving out completely uh man yeah guys I think I am I am going to have to call it pause Here I am very sorry that I make it the full five hours but I really enjoy talking to each and every one of you for this long it's been a total total blast Thank You Korova it's been a real trip I promise you you're gonna get your money's worth if you tried this one be sure to share it with like 20 friends like they suggest I thank you guys I really appreciate it and we will we'll see you again in the future thanks again bye everyone good night or good afternoon wherever you are bye", "FU08QFLnMkI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we will be talking about los angeles's own la familia chocolate the mint flavor to be exact [Music] now la familia is a la based edible company that specializes in mexican style candies and drinks the packaging my goodness tell me how gorgeous this box it came in is now the first time i tried la familia was around three years ago and the packaging was very different i think they've done two rebranding since so it comes in this small box and i really like all the details on it the the name you can see on the side in the back here you'll get all their kind of like calories ingredients and all their disclaimers i love the little detail on this part on the bottom where it says there's no taste like home i love that so basically when you get the packaging you open it up bamboozled there will be a statement from the creator which i really like and then up here you'll get a little diagram of your candy bar and i'll show you how every little stick of the chocolate is 10 milligrams which is super cool now inside that packaging you will find this little bag and this bag contains your candy bar now again i love the color i love the whole theme but i do have some bones to pick with this part of the packaging because it doesn't work it doesn't work basically like this your candy bar goes across um right here it shows where you're supposed to put your fingers and your post a pinch and when you pinch the plastic as opposed to kind of flour open and you're supposed to be able to peel it back and grab your candy bar but since the candy bar is so big where you pinch the candy bar is still there so you can never get it tight enough to where this opens up i was trying for like 30 minutes trying to get it to where it would open and i was never successful at some point i just gave up and i took my scissors and cut it open so that's that's the problem so whoever is in charge of that maybe kind of rethink this i don't know something needs to change inside of that you will find your chocolate bar now i love that they have their name on it as well i thought that was super super cool and it does have a little wheat leaf on the side here so in case a parent finds this and it's like can i give this to my kid do not give this to your child now if you're someone who's into micro dosing or taking less at a time the size of this candy bar is a real benefit because if this is 10 milligrams then of course this will be five and then this will be 2.5 so there you go that's a really nice part of this product because it leaves it open for you to be able to dose yourself how much you need so let's talk about the flavor and the smell so if you're concerned about cannabis smell or taste you definitely don't get it at all on these edibles not one bit the mint flavor is very tasty very strong and it's mixed with a dark chocolate which i loved and it gives it a really familiar taste very similar to you would say like an andes mint or anything like that it's just a really tasty chocolate so if you like dark chocolate and you like mint the combination on these two is to die for you you won't be making a bad decision i'm telling you it's just a really great tasting chocolate you can't go wrong with it you can tell the quality when you try it as for the high the high is very heavy and i loved it i'm here for it the body high is strong i felt it was just a really great high i felt the body high is intense and so is the head high it is just a really great heavy edible if you're someone with a higher tolerance this is inedible than i would suggest if you're someone with a lower tolerance micro dose it as low as possible as you think around 5 to 2.5 and see how that feels for you for me this was great at about 40 milligrams i loved it i was i was chilling um another great thing about this high is that it's not extremely long uh it only lasted for me for about four hours and then i fell asleep which is great though because sometimes you're not looking for highs it'll last you your whole day sometimes you do just want to knock out wake up and have a brand new day which for me this was that now if you're someone who is going to be going to maybe a party and you're going to want to stay up and you're going to want to drive home at some point la familia chocolate is not for you but if you're someone who's going to be chilling at the house maybe hanging out with your family and looking for something that also can help with a sleep aid or some sort of body recovery some sort of muscle recovery this chocolate is absolutely great um i did get the heavy sleeps but that is something sometimes you want from an edible so for the overall experience i would definitely suggest la familia chocolates especially if you're someone like me who takes edibles quite a bit and likes a heavier edible this one is for you it is really tasty really nice the cannabis flavor is nowhere to be seen on it so yeah if you guys go out and you guys see a lot familiar i would say pick them up as for the price i've kind of seen the price range between 19 to 24 so i guess it just depends on what dispensary you go to and what they're selling it at so yeah try it out i loved it it's definitely something i'm going to be buying again and again and again so my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for watching the haze please leave a comment below let me know if you guys tried the law familiar chocolates let me know what you thought about them did they hit for you did they work because they definitely worked for me um please hit that like button please hit that subscribe button i'm trying to get to 100 subscribers so that

you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this

like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "1Ft_K2NUuZY": "okay so this time I'm trying sticky icky strawberry CBD oil from Miss brothers in North Hampton you find them on Facebook

you down that way there online as well talk to on Facebook and there put your nice packet to get a package together and send some out to you absolutely bang-on oh yeah can't fault it like and subscribe", "uhqe6XRPRDM": "hi guys welcome to a produce TV within a video today in partnership with CBD star are we making CBD brownies so to make the CBD brownies we're gonna be using a little something called a TVB so this is already saved but says can be in the form of normal weed or you've got your CBD which is this guy here and we've got you can be here so we're gonna add this at the end of the recipe to get the best effects so first of all you give a grind up your CBD and then you're gonna use it in a herbal vaporizer such as tax-free fine things are the best because you can fit a lot of CBD in there and once that's all thanked essentially just empty your bowl until you get a good amount like that and then so when a lot of people use their CBD in their urban vaporizers they tend to throw away what's left but you can still use this so good think about it you can actually eat it as it is so after you faint it you can eat this if you want it's not going to taste the best so we get an experiment and mix in some brownies so you will need 185 grams of unsalted butter 185 grams of dark chocolate or milk chocolate or any fancy dark chocolate it tastes better yes better of the two 85 grams of plain flour 40 grams of cocoa powder three large eggs and 275 grams of caster sugar and as much anything bitter times will allow you to take so first off we're going to mount our and chocolate and go from there so 185 grams of chocolate and 185 grams of butter yep okay so we're going to put the chocolate in the microwave have for about a minute but keep thinking out about every 10 seconds just to check how it's doing it might take a bit longer than that depending on the microwave just keep on a low setting yeah don't want to burn the truck there okay so once you've melted the chocolate we are weighing out the butter and hundred eggs five grams of butter as well and that goes into another Bowl to know so now we've got the melted butter and then onto chocolate we're going to preheat the oven to 180 degrees 160 from a fan oven so now we're going to mix the chocolate and melted butter together and then ena for a number of a mini or two and then leave that to cool until it's at room temperature one of the things we might receive anything oh we could do cupcakes cookies waffles pancakes you could even make your own chocolate bar essentially anything that involves butter so you can do full course meal and do some lamb shanks some mashed potato well see very much potato nice so now we're gonna line the bowl so it's just so the browning doesn't stick to the bottom anyway so now you're square or rectangle a little bit this we can use to actually butter up there [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're going to do the dry ingredients so you got your flour and cocoa powder your so and you're sure that I often beaten the roads how long does that take specifically to work well it depends on the potency so it all comes down to how much you're gonna put on top but usually the time is in rhythm so half an hour up to two hours so I feel after half an hour to us so it's the same as when you're fading the CBD or when you've got under the drug towns so it will know you out you've been it's relaxed nice got light so if we need 85 grams of flour so now we're just gonna stick this into the bowl get rid of any lumps that are in here so who's even going to help law benefits other so why do you seek deem a leave sort of back pain and a lot of people use it for going to sleep at night so more or less for people veterans or crank pain always having trouble to sleep at night it's gonna help with that now we do need the cocoa powder about 50 grams if you're a poor dane use this evening sorry most of the dry ingredients done now that's what you say as well okay so now we've just broken up some chocolate we're just gonna add some in there for a bit of different texture because it's delicious but obviously you can add anything you want to it's completely optional what you added at this point yeah let's just check those in there yep so next we break in free eggs I'm not as I can't break eggs yeah we need 275 grams of caster sugar that is to go in with the eggs cool yeah it'll weigh down so it's going to make 5 grams of sugar yeah all right now we're going to mix all the egg and sugar together with a whisk for about six to eight minutes yes and you want to whisk it until it's quite pale color joke just show this yes prepay or something yeah that should be good to go cool so what's next so now we're gonna mix in the melted butter and chocolate into the Moosey mixture so we're gonna fold it in to try and keep as much air in there as we can [Music] you don't want to stir it's gonna get rid of the air right joke yeah that's why you're gonna fold it in this way that's it so obviously today we're going to eat TBD but yeah there's lies on the ways you can have CVD what are all the other ways so you've got the flat form which is in that jar there yeah and then you've also got oils so you've got the under the tongue drops you've got the both liquids and you've also got might faint sprays you've got CBD drinks there's out there now possibilities of illness yeah so you always see you see really quite a lot would you say eating's one of the best ways or what would you say is probably the best way of taking CVD I would say that the fake liquids are the best ways to take care cure Lee because as soon as you found that about a minute later is into your system and it's already working you know instead of in Internet yeah and then seconds probably the CBD flour so it's sound principle it gets into your system a lot quicker and then third I would go under the tongue drops and take about half an hour to kick in and with the edibles such as the brownies this can take a piss or two backwards so some people might want a baby or smoke or put it under their tongue Satan's probably a better solution because most people at brownies yeah a lot of people like brownies in some people but you can make any food with singing gays so it doesn't essentially have to be practice yeah so now we're going to add in the chocolate lumps and then we're gonna sit in the rest of this mixture into they're almost done so now the tracks are in there all we have to do is sit in this mix and [Music] so we've finished folding it all in and it's looking pretty much like brownie mixture very Brown nice and gooey yes none of the flowery dustiness to left or anything at all yeah so now we're gonna pour it in and start the cooking process [Music] [Music] so some flat or even as even as we can get anyway now it's just time to cook so you want the thickness of the brownie to be pretty even or over just so you don't have some parts of really cooked in some parts that are all yeah one ends really thick in the others roof in you're gonna have a burnt side and then slightly raw sighs that's not not amazing no it's a we even it's looking good what we have to do now is pop it in the oven for about 25 minutes cuz should be done so it's 25 minutes in the oven yeah if you want to put it in the middle of the oven dry heat so we've set the timer for 25 minutes obviously it's not 25 on there now so we've said it a few seconds ago but once that's done we're gonna double check to see if it's good say if it's wobbling when we move the Train then it has to go in for a little bit longer okay so the Bradley is all done all we have to do now is let cool down and melt the last bit of chocolate for a little layer on top and then we're just gonna sprinkle the avb on top of that is now for the finishing touches we're gonna add the ADB into the melted chocolate pour it on top even out and be done once they're cold why is it worth putting in the chocolate and neither are mixes so you can do it either way but where this has or have been heated up in the PACs device it's already gone through the process of decarboxylate so you're gonna get the effects I mean you can it straight away it just skips having to cook it in butter for about three hours okay so if you didn't want to vape it first yet to get the ABV you would just cook in butter first yeah so what you usually do is in like a slow cooker mix it with some butter leave it for about three hours 10 and staring at about every half an hour okay it's just quicker way to do it so you don't have to bake it first you can just cook in the best yeah [Applause] [Music] so similarly as we did one for the actual brownie mix in there 10 we're now just spreading evenly over the seemingly melted chocolate so we've spreaded on the melted chocolate mix with the avb so we can give it about an hour to cool and then it could to eat oh thank you very much for watching Olivia vape induced e-m-f CVD star share this on to your friends who want to make CBD brownies happy baking [Music] [Music]", "CMLvDxP14JY": "this would be our Korova blackbar thousand milligram it's a 20 dose brownie they're always in stock at Vista Wellness Center it's a great product in great packaging they're always very consistent and a great price thank you", "Qofq6bjOlh4": "[Music] hey guys Justin Ross here with green valley Nation I'm gonna give you a quick review of CB distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil CV distillery uses American grown hemp that is non GMO not certified organic but it is third-party tested in each one milliliter dose of CBD oil you get 33 milligrams of CBD which is printed clearly here on the box see if you're still earning one thousand milligrams CBD oil uses a co2 extraction method they don't add any flavors to the oil itself they do use coconut oil as a carrier so that the product tastes like coconut oil and hemp plant so if the smell or the taste of hemp is not something you enjoy that might be something that you want to consider when purchasing this product see distillery 1,000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil comes in this individually packaged in this nice bright orange box with CBD really easy to read across the top the other thing about this package is the milligrams of CBD per dose or easy to read right here on the front as well and each box comes with a informative pamphlet kind of gives you a little information about CP distillery itself and the product and how they extract the oil and all that the other thing I like about this is the label on the bottle matches the label on the box so if you lose the box no big deal so I'm taking CV distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil for about six months now I usually take between 20 and 35 milligrams at one time I started taking it to see how it would help in my chronic back and knee pain and I noticed after about 20 minutes that I had significant reduction in pain and inflammation in my lower back and my knee I also take it in the evenings before bed to help me calm down from the day so that I sleep well all through the night and I don't wake up with any pain that's an added bonus so the things I like about CP distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil is that it takes away the pain after only 1/2 I can also take it before bed and it'll help me sleep all night soundly and I'll wake up without any pain in the morning the other thing is that it's easy to fit this into my monthly budget the cons are the plant light flavor and the fact that I don't feel like it's quite as strong as some of the others that are in a similar concentration so overall if you're looking for a more economical high concentrated full-spectrum CBD oil and you don't mind a little bit of a plant flavor you can't go wrong with CBS tillery's 1000 milligram full-spectrum or CBD oil my name is Judson Ross and if you liked this review and would like more be sure to

welcome back um before we get into this video I want to you guys to subscribe like comment and share this video um this video is going to be a video that um kind of gives you guys how about like an idea of what I use to help me deal with my anxiety back in January I suffered my very first like severe anxiety attack which also led to a panic at hot um which I had to be rushed to the hospital I couldn't breathe I really didn't know what was happening in like guys I was talking to the nurses and you know everybody they kind of you know knew the symptoms and you it was so they didn't want to medicate me but to you know speak to a group in one so before that happened I was taking a product called just CBD they were gummies they were featuring gummies I think there were about like 250 milligrams for CVD I believe I don't have the continuous with a lot of them um so I was using those those helped me a lot with like sleeping just getting through the day I'm I normally take one in the morning and then take one at night from what I was going to bed um and then I switched over to the vape CBD I know in some areas um vaping is banned I'm in my state it's the e-cigarettes um when choosing you brand for vaping and I know like I said everyone's gonna be like oh baby it's dangerous I think this um being able to find a brain that you trust um with their products and you know what's in it they're transparent about it with something big going into it um I have a smoke shop in my area in downtown Boston in the cold smoke city shop I will link them down below they also sell just CBD products they sell the gummies but they don't so be the they being or the cartridges um so I wanted to show you guys a little haul of items that I got now do you also want to clarify in this video this is not a sponsored video by just CBD these are thought of my own products just brought my own money and so nothing you know was sent there's no sponsorship in the city I'm not being paid for this this is my own opinion my own thoughts on the brands as a whole so without further ado we're gonna jump right into it and we're gonna open these little bad boys I did split it to make sure everything was any in make sure I had everything that I got in it so we're just gonna jump right into it so the first item we are going to pull out is a date juice I got this in the flavor mango mango ice is the flavor and it's a hundred and it's a hundred milligrams and we're gonna open it and see what it looks like on the inside so this is the big bottle that it comes with and this is like set for a pretty good decent price for it I believe it wasn't check step inside so these were $15.99 each so I have this flavor like I said it's the mango mango ice in that flavor and I spend on the side of the box um it does give you the where it's talks about it being um tobacco free conveniently need for your e cigarette vaping devices for intense sources and like I said CBD does not replace going to your doctor if you do take medication continue to consult your doctors on that me I just don't want to be medicated so like I said I do the gummies and now I'm like I said I'm switching over to the the oils I can so take it with me so I'm not carrying on this big bike like jock of gummy so it's kind of like another convenient for me I'm gonna see what other goodies I'm having here we also have the pineapple Express and this one comes based off of the Navy find out for sports if you have not seen it so it comes like this as well the same jar just different flavor you see it looks like a fair way to open it there we go you can smell it too so that that was also $15.99 I got three different flavors on this one is watermelon og time I want to get like flavors um if you do follow me on instagram you would have saw that I posted in a story I'm all plus the story in this video somewhere on the screen um I've gotten a pen from Busey so I have an Uzi pen the cartridge on top comes from panda sticks I believe that's how you pronounce it I will also link that pen in the cartridge down below if you want to go purchase those too I got that ez pen in that cartridge first because I knew this was coming and with everything going on I did not know if I was going to receive anything I'm via the mail but everything was still running normal and I got it within a good decent time frame so this is what the I said watermelon og looks like in this big bottle and I love the fact that the bottles are big like these are very big bottles for the price that I got them before like I've seen like I said in the smoke shop I go to they have like bottles smaller than this for the same price so I love the fact that these are big bottles they'll last me a while and I'm glad I got the three different flavors that they did I love the that I have so I'm really glad I got those and then I have a disposable cartridge it's like this is the watermelon so the Sigma C of OG 1 for it so this one is a disposable one this one is 200 milligrams for these cartridge let me open it so it looks like and then from boozy I did I do have an order coming from them my main include them in this video but it's this is more of a just EEE video because this is the main products that I'm going to be using like I'm not gonna go back to the Panda stick cartridge Luzi I'll keep the pen just cuz I have so I'll have the pen so I had two different pens so I also gun pen from just CBD but I'm just sticking to just CBD I'm not switching I'm not doing anything like I said I enjoyed the brain as a whole their response to customer service is really good like things like it's not like you're not waiting a whole entire day to hear back from somebody if you have an issue on a product I mean you can get a response right away so this is the and I may switch over to this one today this is what the pen looks like if I can get ever get it out hopefully by the end of this video I can get it out for you guys and show you guys what it looks like and put it on the pen so we're gonna sit this off to the side real quick so what they're also like I said I did order a battery so this is what the battery looks like um theirs is a 5-10 VV twist battery um the Uzi stick I have is also a 5-10 battery so I can also use the cartridges from just see beating on that pen in the future but like I said I did order 3 of the cartridges from Louise because I did order an Uzi pen so like I have three pens now so I have the first uz one be just CBD one I just showed you and then there's another one coming from Uzi so they each have their own cartridge and I can grab the Izzi pen and she goes it looks like I want to get this pout oh yeah my Lu Zhi ping it's like a little metallic like rainbow fish color the other one is a Rastafari so it has a Jamaican colors and this is the cartridge up top so the cartridge up top is from panda stick and like I said I will link it below and the stick is from and the battery is so easy so that is that one so I'm ordering so I ordered another battery in three of the cartridges to be able to fill because the only thing with just CBD I did not see and even I missed it but it's okay that they don't have like the cartridges sold on their own like he does like it was he has the ones which we can be filled with liquid so just CBD didn't have those and less like I said I missed it and I didn't see it hopefully in the future they do release some like that so we're like individually in the art empties like this one is if I don't think I can get the cap off for this one I can try but I so this is what this one looks like is the like I said the watermelon flavor we're gonna do a test to see how it tastes and like I said as I know people's concerns are she like be safe and I am like I said I'm not walking around like every hour gaping I'm I normally do it in the more like in the morning when I wake up I do about two to pups that's it um and then that night same thing two puffs that's it so I'm not like so because the guy was like oh this cartridge should last you you know only a couple of days like this has lasted me like almost a week and I guess I can show you what it looks like when everything goes down but has lasted me I pretty decent amount of time because I'm not pulling on it and I keep it my pen stays on 3.3 v so it does not leave that area so it does not leave you can see it on the bottom it does not leave that smart so like it's on the lowest of the low so I'm not puffing so much so this is what the pen looks like and I love that piece and these have a lower voltage so these this one starts at two point two point zero B this one starts at three point three in the highs that it goes to is four point zero which I love so I can definitely put that on a smaller voltage I'm sold it like I said so and then this is my charging port that will go into it like I said I also have another the same thing came with this one that was e1 mix and I love effect you just twist and it comes on so these are the two that I have like I said this one is just CBD which is labeled is label sorry about that my camera dies I'm gonna make this really quick so these are the two that I have and then the last item I don't know like there was a certain thing going on but they sent me a free a free item I don't know if I mean it's like I never tried this so this is there just and it's a body soap I'm so I'm down there to really try this in the flavour of cherry pie and it smells really good I open the box I like what I'd like smells really good I didn't know this was even in there so I'm kind of a little free treat to try it so you guys so I'm definitely I'm going to try this come to night and see how I like it and see how it worked like fields and they said it's created for all faces and all skin types to enjoy to him him Ronnie so so it's handcrafted body so label and sing it with it I'm not the lighting looks different in the camera looks flipped in a different way please excuse me I kind of switch over to my phone to film the remainder of it so yeah so this is the soap duck I said that came with it um this one I did not purchase on my own um this one was sent in the box I don't know if it was like a free gift and he spent so much I said I opened it it was in there so thank you just see beauty for this one um but like I said I'm so proud of everything that I had like I said the stick the bat the flavors and I definitely would have you guys posted on how you know I'm doing with them and like I said I love them all to death like the company in itself is all is a good brand um I hope they do come out with more flavours um I hope that they do come out with just the cartridges on their own I'm not pre filled with anything so you can just order it all together as weight on one but yeah if you are interested in any of the products or have any questions you can also definitely shoot me and leave a comment down below or you can also screw me ng M I will link all the products down below that I have and that I got from them in the description box down below and also I will link their website so you can definitely check out Jesse needy and like I said I don't have any negatives like I loved everything like everything that I've had so far from them so like thick dummies I loved they were amazing so I do you know I said ordering more dummies from them like I said they have sugar-free gum means they have to dry fruit they have all different types for anyone looking and if you want to know more information about CBD oil and CBD and how it works I will definitely leave like clips in in like at the end of the video where you can go to and check it out and get information like advise you to do your research on any brand that you try where is his oils and dummies anything um like I said they clearly say on their site that they do not none of their products continue vitamin E which should be all do by me II was what was in a cigarette that was killing people and causing lung issues with their products like I said the Panda stick I checked on their site too as well they have listed that they do not use vitamin E in their CBD oils I'm CBD everyone's like Oh CBD you should high it sweet no CBD does not get you high CBD is part of my marijuana plant but it's not the part that gets you high so you're safe if you are worried about being drug tested you can definitely lecture they definitely recommend you to let your employer know beforehand that you do take CBD or CBD so then you know exactly what's going on and you're not going off by any weird surprises that come your way like I said I thank you guys for watching this video hope you guys enjoyed and like I said let me know down below if you cop any products that I have and thank you for watching hope see you guys in my next one you", "mY20TICyT8g": "what's going on everyone my name is chris here at CBD review lab and today i'm reviewing the savage CBDs 1000 milligram full spectrum CBD oil specifically their peach and pear flavor so savage CBD is based in California and they've been in the CBD game since 2015 and they carry a massive selection of products all of which are a third-party tested by SC labs so you know you're getting products that you can trust when I was looking at the certificate of analysis for this specific product the lab results showed that there's actually over 42 milligrams of CBD per milliliter in this product so while they market it had 1000 milligrams it's actually close four to twelve hundred and sixty milligrams of CBD which I'm totally cool with so the oil itself has a clear appearance to it and it has a nice fruity smell and taste with absolutely no bitterness where cannabis taste at all it is hands-down the best tasting CBD oil I've tried so far and I've tried quite a few CBD oils so my dosage for this product has been two milliliters which according to the certificate of analysis is over 80 milligrams of CBD and I've been very pleased with the results I find that it doesn't relax my body as much as other CBD oils but it does seem to relax my mind and it makes me very sleepy I don't know if the CBD strain that they use to make their products is a sativa but I seem to feel it more in my head than in my body which I'm actually a big fan of I love getting that body high from CBD but this is been quite enjoyable as well so as far as price goes this Teamster runs $85 if you use the discount code CBD review lab and if we go off the lab results which say there's 1260 milligrams of CBD in this product the price comes out to under seven cents per milligram of CBD and I consider 10 cents to be average so it's below average so to summarize I think savage CBD offers a solid CBD oil it works well and it's under ten cents per milligram so I've got a link to their website in the description below and don't forget to use the discount code to save some money if you end up trying them out so thank you so much for watching I hope this video was helpful if you have any questions please leave them down below I hope everyone has a great day peace", "vOZQqYB52Lk": "[Music] what's up fun wolf and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show we help you make sense of your dispensary cocoa cocoa classic episode today and that means edible my favorite of all cannabis products we are taking a look at ed abou and I believe our second product may be third from Moon Moon Moon intergalactic milligram each intergalactic milligram each milligrams milligrams so this is a 100 milligrams of they're a rocket fudge sounds good I've had their spaceman mint bar before also 100 milligrams and I found it to be excellent so I'm coming up this one with some pretty high expectations we've got some pretty standard packaging but nice you know it's got everything you want to see on it including the lab testing results right there on the front from SC Labs which is great and then on the back you've got your nutrition information your ingredients and then right there whoops on that side mirrors are reversed it shows you your different ten milligrams serving size suggestions I think they're supposed to have discrete different little things but they don't but who cares and I picked this up from a brand new dispensary in Long Beach opened just yesterday called the lift and I picked it up for 20 bucks which is pretty expensive but not that expensive for a Long Beach okay oh wow and then look at this we've got even more packaging there on the inside with the childproof zipper thingy I think I figured out this one boy I have seen probably probably five that seems about right five different childproof mechanisms these modern child proofing packages I've seen and they're all different and they all are infuriating in their own little ways like this one I can see what I'm supposed to do but the mechanism isn't lining up right let's hope they get this [ __ ] ironed out soon because it sucks not to have that all right oh here we go here are the moon bars there are half of them there all right no there are six so there should be four remaining in here oops and there we go there the other four they say THC on them and this is the rocket fudge let's shut up and stick it in my mouth hall and of course guys I'm gonna be eating the whole thing not just the one ten milligram piece um that eat the whole hundred milligrams and then come back to you guys at the end of the review to let you know how all this is hitting so two hours later I'll come back to you guys mmm yuck as far as chocolate goes that's one of those cannabis tea tasting chocolates I've ever had um this chocolate doesn't mask the cannabis flavor really at all but that could be a great thing I've got my fingers crossed that that means this is potent as hell and they've got a lot of strong THC and vibed weed in there but if taste is important to you stick to your kiba's stick to your defenses cuz this does not taste good I'm actually surprised by how bad it tastes mmm well it does have me optimistic that this thing is gonna rock my world when when we come back so again taste ooh not so great especially for chocolate but it's all about that potency and so guys I'm gonna eat the last remaining six of these and then I'll come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching to this point and I'll see you guys very soon boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom moon moon moon moon moon if I want to get banned from it YouTube I'd show you my ass right now guys it's been about three hours since I actually had moon that's because I was feeling so nice and so relaxed and so high that I wanted to just keep on with that bus and three hours later I am still quite high this is another real win for moon it tastes bad it's one of the worst tasting chocolates I've ever had but but but it is only a hundred grams or sorry grams calories which is so much better than like the Korova mini cookies I know I just had like the Pete's mini cookies and they had 700 calories you had to eat a [ __ ] it tastes really bad to be honest but you have to only eat so little that little chocolate bars only like that big you know that wide so you just you know you can eat it in three bites and be done with it it's not gonna be pleasant but you are gonna get really stoned and you're not gonna have to eat a whole lot if you want to just grab something to split between three buddies pop it in your mouth man this will get three pretty people probably pretty feeling pretty high before like a show movie whatever moon has been surprisingly man for a smaller edible company or seemingly smaller I don't see them a lot of places I have really enjoyed my time with them this is a big big thumbs up for me guys so if you see moon in their rocket fudge or I think I reviewed their spaceman mint before go for it man they're great and guys right before I balance here I'm going to share with you something that is weed related as a cherry on top I knew I normally try to share something without you or share something with you that is not weed related but I want to go ahead and share with you something that you can definitely use I've had this bad way for a year now although it's oddly gross on the top this grinder is amazing Black Tie grinders used it every time I have flour don't really have to clean it very often it's just a very very sharp very very handy grinder I think it cost me 20 something dollars on Amazon you know upgraded from like the two dollar pieces of plastic [ __ ] to something really nice and the Black Tie grinders is quite as as nice as their logo implies so that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review both great products wholeheartedly endorse both thank you so much for watching to the end you big jerks and by jerks I mean Best Buddies thanks again and we will see you guys on the next review doses", "TJ3Zu690qX4": "[Music] hi everybody Cheri Sicard AKA cannabis sherry here with a review today of coda signature cannabis infused chocolate bars now this big mess you see in front of me is the after-effects of a chocolate tasting party some friends and I have last night to taste these various chocolate bars and it's a mess cos one we were excited to taste the chocolate but really it's a big mess like this because the folks at coda are very very serious extremely serious about childproof packaging so these were a bear to get into I mean you're gonna need some hardware to get into these boxes like some scissors or a knife or something but once we did get into those boxes there was delicious medicated treasure inside and these came in a bunch of flavors and we really loved most of them and I'll get to the ones we didn't in a minute but there is some really creative flavors and even some flavors that kind of sounded funky to me like caramel and corn or coffee and donuts and those ended up being some of my favorites the caramel and corn has a sweet salty thing going on kind of like kettle corn does that made it pretty irresistible coffee and donuts tasted like a milk milk chocolate snickerdoodle cookie so that was good the maple and pecan bar had a really nice subtle undertone maple flavor that I loved my favorite of all though is the fire and orange which was a delicious orange flavor dark chocolate with just a hint of chili pepper spice the snap and spice for me had to overpowering a flavor of ginger but those in the group that like ginger did like that one as well the one nobody likes though was the cream and crumble that was a white chocolate bar that was meant to taste like cheesecake everybody thought that one kind of had a funky flavor especially on the aftertaste but we loved loved loved the rest of these Koda in few use chocolate bars now each bar has a hundred milligrams of co2 extracted THC and each little square is a five milligram dose and if you don't want to just eat your chocolate bars plain see the links below for my recipe to dab torch s'mores because you could use a little square of this chocolate in that recipe to make some fabulous medicated s'mores so check out that link below Kota signature chocolates they're made from ethically sourced cacao from South America so you can feel good about eating them right now they are available in California and Colorado I hope they're going to be expanding beyond that but right now if you're in California or Colorado you can enjoy these fabulous gourmet chocolate bars eat your weed [Music]", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "U1cV66TM-Z0": "please state your name my name is Stephen right on we're gonna be putting you through a bit of a wringer a few tests to see how the how the Korova bar fix you you want to read us what's on the package they're basically the warning label states medical cannabis edibles may cause drowsiness keep out of reach of children and pets do not operate a motor vehicle while taking this medication there's really no warning about one's own fate would you say you have a rather high cannabis tolerance when it comes to edibles very confident you enjoy them yes but this one this one's a thousand grams 20 doses and the mark does say 5150 on it what does that mean to my understanding that is the code for psychotic behavior please need to take proper action it does okay well then uh yeah let's go ahead and start this [ __ ] challenge [Music] take a deep breath [Applause] check it out that is pretty sweet moist it is very moist and kind of tell there's like two different kind of chocolate layers in there this thing so they really did a good job making that is delicious [Music] show us the Keen mouth it squeeze it is yeah I have 20 doses of THC you're currently going into my stomach which will soon take effect into my system we'll see how that goes keep you posted as you can see it is gone it is absolutely delicious and what's the other miss this day goes to [Music] 30 it was all ingested waiting around feel like something's gonna happen no it's early better we got the ambulance number we had that burrito so [ __ ] hope a lot of chocolate feeling anything yet slight tingle tingle feel like you're gonna [ __ ] your pants yeah it's a possibility right that's always a possibility yeah so much chocolate it 10:30 in the morning yeah so I'm assuming that's what that is [Music] feeling invincible right now alright [Music] [Applause] yeah how you feeling [Music] [Music] I feel like you can hit that bottle that's number two still got it nice arms outstretched and look at the sky with your balance not too bad not too bad now you need to count from one to twenty five counting only every third number and backwards last count down twenty-five backwards counting every third number okay five point you yeah for one okay that was a marginal pause but we'll call it a bus so you're not feeling it no I just feel it's not okay but we're we're two and a half hours in you know this is and your eyes look fine I feel funny from the things okay maybe maybe it has taken effect three looks like the pelvic bone of an animal you better choose one of them yeah it looks like - distorted Eskimos playing patty-cake I could go with that this was a saint edge amazing I was like I was like Jesus and save by what yeah it looks like someone exposing herself to me hehe our cat that's what that looks like now monsters swooping down to eat the helpless puppy dog who now looks like people having sex see from below that's interesting no these are hard yeah it looks like something a brain damage kids my drawing class yeah it looks like a pulsing heart ripped from the chest of its victim not really whoa Indian shamans dancing around the fire personality and in fact you're probably the kind of person that pulled the wings off ice with you a little everyone likes you this is because your life is such a mess that everyone else is relieved that they aren't you if you aspire to become a CEO of a large powerful company this is unlikely since you are looking rarely leave your parents basements your primarily function at work is to serve as a bad example but at least you do very well very very well okay your personal motto is practice makes perfect but since nobody is perfect you might as well stop wasting your time [ __ ] these two so how do you feel now hey do you like the bar a good bar b bar you'd recommend it I was to your granny no would you recommend the whole bar necessarily cause it tastes so good do you probably chop it up into and you'll still get a pretty damn good right I bet ten seconds left give me another 30 seconds now go find it or the theory hey what's up guys it's chilly here from the nub just wanted to give you a quick recap on how the Korova challenge win no freak outs no nothing like that wanted to give you the official count on the THC on the bar 1100 CW analytical really did a great job good layout here you can see my hidden THC camp 1133 so breakdown of the bacteria the mold the yeast as far as pain relief and stuff like that I mean hands down it's a great bar if you're trying to get something out of it as far as like messing up your day or really getting screwed up and stuff like that it's not that kind of bar have a lot of water handy the next day I did have a splitting headache for about the majority of the day to anyone out there who would like to repeat this sort of thing or try it for yourself have some water maybe a friend nearby but yeah have at it there's a lot of fun tastes delicious [Music]", "5B74JVtSACo": "today's an exciting day because it's the first-ever cannabis drinks Expo thank you sir we are sold out it's thousand people attending here this place is packed with people it is did you expect this yes this is for the weekend warriors for the professional athletes anybody who really is just thirsty you know beverages don't have that cannabis taste that a lot of people think that they're going to get the drinks tastes delicious they work great and it's just a nice feeling how is it very good [Music] the size of the crowd says it all cannabis could be the next big frontier in the beverage world but it wasn't a natural fit every single one of these drinks is made with an ingredient that doesn't dissolve in water our first beverage you can turn it upside down and you'd see that cannabis go up and down THC drinks were a little bit like salad dressing so they had to be shaken and bottom didn't taste or smell that good it all comes back to a simple truth oil and water don't mix it's backbase it does not mix well once you add it to beverages though it starts out as the green plant we all recognize the cannabis we're talking about gets distilled into a thick oil that's nearly solid at room temperature it mixes well with the makings of chocolate which are also fat based so companies like Stillwater ingredients hired experts from the candy industry we've solved it before our eyes they pour these crystals into a glass of water and they appear to dissolve lipids cannot dissolve in water but you can do is coat them in a surfactant and then enable them to be water compatible Industrial sauna mechanics makes this contraption that sends sound waves through the cannabis oil to break it up into tiny particles then coat them with a slippery substance that stays suspended in water it's nanotechnology and it's the solution that's unlocked a whole new kind of adult beverage Keith makes cannabis Cola root beer and sparkling water for those who want a wave of refreshment with a splash of THC Cheers and bottoms up with the cannabis drinks from Tinley all modeled after your neighborhood bar our whole approaches and alcohol inspired type strategy so we've got ready to drink tonics stoned AZ which would be compared to a margarita they offered tastings here at the show of samples without cannabis oh yeah it is ice-cold there are cocktails and shots it smells very cinnamon it may be no surprise the industry's going after a specific customer those who are less experienced with cannabis but love trying new drinks craft beer consumers are perfect for cannabis drinks because they're into experimenting new beverages and though there is hemp beer and weed wine there's one thing you won't find drinks can have cannabis or they can have alcohol but they can't have both it's the ultimate irony stopping nausea was a major reason marijuana was first legalized for medical use because remember cannabis isn't only about getting high all right bring CBD into the sports world now legal in all 50 states hemp derived CBD is making his way into seemingly everything including this sports drink it really is calming it helps with pain inflammation Guardian taps into a whole other market for these drinks those looking to use cannabis for wellness so we wanted to go with the all organic no refined sugar they're going after the same crowd as eat green people come to cannabis to help them with their health I don't want to give someone diabetes while trying to help them come back eat Green makes cold-pressed juices in three different versions it's this the packaging right here the hemp drinks can be sold anywhere the first thing I smell is watermelon is there real watermelon but at dispensaries they sell THC versions one with a little and one with a lot cannabis products can't cross state lines so all these drinks are made and sold in California at least for now and tomorrow the world", "C2ko0fFeXaY": "what is good y'all good morning it is zoody patoot you already know back for another cannabis review on the baked boys you already know what it is if you don't definitely look into these guys definitely look these up these are the best thing on the cannabis market right now for vapes carts whatever you're looking into just for portable dabs this is freaking it uh freaking rechargeable tastes amazing better than any cart that i've i've come across personally uh it's just like taking a dab it even you know tastes like freaking mango this is what the whole box looks like and then you pop them out of the box and then another another baked bar packaging just so if you guys are getting these make sure like they are double packed and if they're not they're probably not real but these are a brand new brand new uh company uh straight from cali and uh they are just getting started so if you want to go ahead and look them up on instagram they're on instagram i don't think they have built their website yet but you know i've been talking back and forth with uh the person on there so uh definitely a good brand definitely quality quality product right here and that's what people are looking for especially in the cart game right now some people are scared of additives being being put in there it already says right here you know max strength lab tested and solvent-free to stood so uh it's got all the little markings don't throw it away you know recycle it properly it's a disposable so you know don't don't just be tossing it in the wrong or california they got big recycling laws and all that stuff so that's up to your discretion um 21 and older what is this right here probably not for pregnant women i mean just just basic stuff that goes on on cannabis products out in california but uh just guys go try one go try one because these are probably my new favorite thing in the world right now like you know i love my dabs but just having a portable portable little it's just like a freaking it's about the same size of a jewel or a uh a puff bar you know it's the same thing as a puff bar but it's just it's distillate so and they hit so freaking hard like you're just sitting here pulling it and then like when you exhale you don't even realize like you're blowing out a cloud because you barely feel it inhaling and to me that's that's how i tell if it's good distillate or not you uh it's not rough on the inhale but it's rough on the exhale and that's just a rule of thumb for all carts if you're experimenting with carts right now but you know thanks for watching y'all go get you one the baked bars bake the bar official on instagram go get into the hype you already know zooteep appreciate", "a61vjUPxcFc": "hello senior stunt fans is the real senior stunner back at you today we're gonna be discussing powerful edibles this is non liquid mostly chocolate but let's talk about starting at the top with my WoW brownie remember edibles are to be used very carefully this in particular is some of the strongest edibles I've come in contact with the WoW brownie 500 milligrams bottom line even though it's not that big one bite and you got to put it down and wait an hour and a half two hours because I found it to be almost too strong so be careful with while brownies they're very strong mostly a sativa / hybrid on the upside there Delta which is a more traditional Delta nyan edibles this is a classic 250 milligram milk chocolate that for people it's scored into nine different pieces for people who just want to have it casually this one is much more intense for the experience usually this would be something even a beginner could eat into over here let's move on down to our pj butters assortment we have two today that we're gonna look at on the right is a traditional Belgian milk chocolate double dose with 300 milligrams that means you can take it to a movie or a concert pop it in your pocket it's real small look how small it is and it's very discreet here it is in Belgian chocolate with cappuccino flavor also PJ butter 300 milligram Sheriff with a friend please I bought this because I thought it was gonna be really exciting I'm looking forward to it this is a hive I've talked ilat Belgian chocolate flavor came a lot of different flavours what they do with this 400 milligram puppy is they score it they score at a number I think they score at 20 different pieces he bought you cut out a little piece for yourself and / - so you're in 40 milligrams apiece take two of those and you'll be very very happy let's move over to bang this is medical cannabis pretzel chocolate and this is one for one person that says double strength but for me 120 milligrams really is gonna be for me now I want to take this and go into detail the Wow 250 bar is made by the same people that make the Wow brownies and you have to be very very careful some reason I don't know what they're using on inside of their edibles because it doesn't tell me if it's distill it or cannabis oil for weed it's incredibly strong their brand let's move to something that I've experienced with I've tried the G bar before the 500 milligram buy lol edibles very tasty this is done really nicely it's a pretty package but it's also a very tasty bar because of that I purchased some 1000 milligram bars they're the same size but more potent so yesterday I attempted to take a piece of one of these were the day before oh my goodness I had a piece of one of these and I had a bite of the brownie no drink during the day and oh my god so I think what has to be said about edibles especially edibles with this type of power because these are really powerful animals is you need to go very slow and in small small pieces you're not like me don't think you are with edibles most people I've been doing edibles for a very long time if you have and you understand what I'm saying they can overwhelm you very quickly so you don't want to turn book could be a great experience and have it be a pain in the ass because you don't feel good so remember go slow but go bold or go home right this is a fine assortment of edible high potency edibles I wanted to take a look at from the real senior stoner everybody have a great day thanks taking a look", "LfdsaO34phE": "hello everyone and welcome to my channel I am low to describe and today I'm gonna be talking to you about a product that I have here that I have been using for a little while now I have been using CBD products before and they have helped me and so I decided to try this brand this brand is called just CBD and the these are their Signature Series cartridges the one that I have right now that I am currently using is the pineapple express this is a hybrid cartridge it says so right here on the label and another one that I have been using is the is the Sour Diesel this is one of those sativa cartridges they come in this clear plastic container with like a cork top so I think that's pretty nice that they do that this is how they actually look right here so this is the full-spectrum container this is glass right here and it comes with this pretty awesome wood tip and I shall see that right there how it looks and I have been using it with this vape pen its BIOS if y'all haven't heard of that brand or I'm sure that y'all have heard of the brand it's very good very reputable brand it comes with a that you can set the voltage down here at the bottom and you can choose which voltage you would like to have it as so with me I use CBD products mostly for my depression in my anxiety I also use it to calm my nerves whenever I feel stressed out or in a stressful situation I have used Lazarus naturals before the only thing with that is with that one it kept me up at night and then I did you CBD MD and that helped me as well and so I decided to try these out since I have been tired more tired lately and so I decided to try the pineapple Express and the Sour Diesel since the pineapple Express is a hybrid cartridge and I read on there it is a 60% sativa and a 40% what's a 60% sativa and a 40% indica and they're Sour Diesel is a sativa so they have lab reports on their cartridges and they also have lab reports on other products that they do have that y'all can check out so with these with the Geist CBD brand the cartridges they have another one also so they have the sativa the Sour Diesel the hybrid pineapple Express and they also have another one called Northern Lights now Northern Lights is an indica as for more of like whenever you want to relax more of you can use it before bedtime to help you sleep I haven't tried that one yet but I'm going to be trying that one soon enough I might get it later on today or tomorrow I have to see if I have time to actually go purchase it but these two cartridges that I have here they have been really helping me out lately with giving me more energy with giving me more of a positive outlook because usually with my depression I was given by the doctor antidepressants to take but I haven't taken those yet because I would like to try more natural stuff before I actually take antidepressants so I have been doing my research on what products to take I have been doing my research on on the different terpenes on that health depression and different terpenes that help would get more energy more activity more focused and so far these have really been helping me this brand has really been helping me so far and I'm gonna try there like I said I'm gonna try there indica Northern Lights and then also with this whenever I take a hit from it it is like the smoothest inhale I have ever taken from from a CBD brand it is like very very smooth on the throat does not irritate the tro does not irritate the lungs these two that I have they come in 200 milligrams CBD and it's 100% u.s. grown hemp has a right here on the label and also it has it on their website and like I said before they have lab reports on all of their products so y'all can check their products to make sure how much CBD or you are getting how much what the terpenes are that you are getting I highly suggest this brand I bought these out of my own money so I'm not endorsed I'm not a paid by them or anything and I don't have like a affiliate link to use I have just been using these out of my own interests and out of my own for my health to help me get better and so that I can do more one thing that I want to let you know that I have talked about in my other CBD products reviews is that with any CBD product there if you have to take a drug test there is a possibility that you come out positive for THC depending on your on where you work if they drug test you or if they don't there are people or companies that say like on here it says zero percent THC I'm not sure if you I can see that zero percent THC let me show the other one actually they have recovered up but it says zero percent THC on it and so whenever it says represent THC that is 0% basically it is under the amount that's that's not legal it's under the amount that's that's detectable for THC on the lab reports that they done but there have been cases in a group that I follow on facebook called CBD oil users I highly recommend y'all check it out if y'all can but on that group that I follow they have been cases where people have said that they took a drug test from their job and they came out positive and they ended up having to lose their job because they thought the product was you know the people told them it was zero percent THC you're not gonna be show up on a drug test and all that but you can on any CBD product you can show up on a drug test because over time it accumulates in the fat cells and it also depends on your metabolism and each person is different they're having people who have been on CBD for like a year and they have not come out positive and there's people that have been on CBD for a month and they have come out positive so it each depends on the person but as for these the gist CBD brands the pineapple Express in the Sour Diesel the taste I don't know if it's just me but they taste very similar but that just could be my taste buds I'm still you know China deciphered the flavor it's they taste to me more of like floral what do you type but that's just me and my taste buds and on what I've tasted so far there is another CBD product that I have been taking that our review next time and I just wanted to show you all these these ones that I had I bought these at my local smoke shop they had a very good reputable reputable brands that I seen these were $34.99 for each one and I would think that it's worth it because of the way that they look the way that the glass and the full-spectrum is and also comes with this really awesome tip one thing that I do get to say though that I didn't like about them it could be the shop itself on and on how long they had the product or it could be the way that they are packaged but when I first bought the my first cartridge which was this one it was gunked-up at the bottom it was gunked-up at the bottom and I'm not sure if you I can see these little holes right here but they were like black and I'm guessing because maybe the CBD oil with the conduit it just got clogged up and so when I went to take a hit and nothing came out so I had to go back I got another one that looked like this like they had the black and nothing came out of that one either until we found one that was clean one that was clear and I made sure with this other one to make sure that it was clean and clear and I took a hit from those that let me test it before I took it out to make sure that the product was working well and it was and since I've got these it's just been phenomenal so me personally I suggest y'all try it out if you want to like I said next time I have another product that I'm going to be reviewing by funky farms and so hopefully y'all stick around for that one so with these the pineapple Express the Sour Diesel and then the Northern Lights by just CBD and I also suggest checking out their website I'll put the website in the link in description down at the bottom so that y'all can check it out but if you are having any problems like let's say tired anxiety the or any other symptoms that you can find on the on ano zone there is CVD that might be out helping CVD can work for you or it cannot there are lots of products that are out there and it just takes time to find the right product that y'all are looking for I highly suggest if you are getting maybe like discouraged or anything don't give up on trying the product don't give up on on find the right one because whenever you find the right one it'll make a world of a difference thank you for sticking around and listening to my review on just CBD on their Signature Series vague cartridges and hopefully I'll enjoy talk to you later", "FD4joFW13co": "[Music] what's good bass-drum militia I'm bass drop keys your friendly neighborhood Negro and today we're gonna talk about how to calculate edible dosage now recently I started a cooking with cannabis show called good eats on my channel where we make different meals infused with cannabis because of this I've been getting a lot of questions on how to calculate edible dosage so let's go ahead and get into this okay so in order to calculate your dosage you will need two bits of information you need to know the THC percentage of your cannabis and also you need to know how many grams of cannabis you'll be using to make your edibles for this tutorial let's pretend like we're going to make 2 cups of butter or four sticks I actually have some gorilla glue right now that's been tested at 17% THC so that's what we're going to use now normally when I make Kenna butter I use a quarter of flour per stick so for this tutorial we'll be using 28 grams or accounts of cannabis to make four sticks of butter like I normally do the first thing that you need to know is that there is a thousand milligrams in one gram of cannabis so the first thing that we need to do is we need to take our 28 grams that we'll be using and turn it into milligrams to do that we're going to take the 28 grams so we're going to multiply it by a thousand which is 28,000 the next thing we need to do is to multiply that by the amount of THC that's in our cannabis in decimal form so that means that our 17 percent THC cannabis is going to turn into 0.17 twenty-eight thousand times point one seven equals four thousand seven hundred and sixty so there's four thousand seven hundred and sixty milligrams of THC and this batch of butter that we're making right now but remember this is actually one of the four sticks of butter because we're doing two cups that means that we need to divide it by four that means that each stick of butter is actually one thousand one hundred and ninety milligrams of THC but let's go further let's say that we're going to make brownies and your brownie recipe calls for half a stick of butter that means there will be five hundred milligrams of THC inside of your brownie mix now if we take our recipe and make 10 brownies with our brownie mix that means each brownie will have fifty nine point five milligrams of THC inside each individual brother so that's it that's how you calculate edible dosage you have to find out how many milligrams of THC is actually in the whole batch and then break it down into how many portions you'll be making so I hope that this video helped you out if you have any questions please leave them in the comment section also let me know if you like this new style of videos that I'm doing I appreciate you watching much love as

like yeah he's so right and it's what I know this is like a classic meme it's a it's a hot chick that's walking and it's a guy and his girlfriend and then the guy turns around and is checking out the hot chick and so the hot chick is small amounts of weed the guy is the police and the girlfriend is actual crimes so the guys ignoring actual crimes to go to I pay all sorts of attention to small amounts of weed which you can buy at a store which doesn't hurt anybody which is really good medicine but let's let's go bust balls on it since they might not be paying a proper tax on it you know I will take you on in the news Scotty's got a new story revolving around this discussion a little bit yeah a little bit man thanks frosty good stuff and no grambo posted this over egg I stole this off

that we invested in his new meme generator I'm having a real good time I cruise over there and lots of good stuff over there and Thank You Vlad II buddy I still like your memes sir let me tell you what a medicating medicating with today is Panama man what's up super lemonade Canadian DGC he's got some called Panama I've never tried it okay though until today on the show he said it's a super sativa man so we're gonna see how this rolls with the show and then in a next grow talk show I'll get into a little bit of his gross style and things that he's done as well as it's an awesome man I got you can see right in front of me here in front of my my computer in the studio the the these are just a few amount of the jars the friendly Canadian DDC as you can see rainbows on the on the end is the biggest with a zombie crush but man it's been awesome to be able to use a mailing system you know just imagine if you could do that there how much better it would be daddy I am jealous of that I've got to be completely honest I'm jealous there's all these new edibles I want to try there's all these CBD products I want to try make I can't you mail CBD in America I'm confused I thought you care yeah come on come on take it up with AG boy man FOH health CBD man you know how to do it yeah actually talking to a boy he's been a really good friend to me lately man so right on so what are you guys medicating with me you know I actually picked the sauce jaren left some of this sauce yesterday was he's got two strains he's been grown one is the wedding cake and then the other is the sauce and I can barely tell the difference between that when he just you know pulls out nugs well I say those are both dicks I know the sauces and I want to say the wedding cake is both the exotic genetics got it okay jaren is a big fan of exotic genetics I mean he doesn't write man that wedding cakes gray and this sauce tastes amazing landsem as long as I have Jen weed I'll be smoking it sauce from the concentrate boots flower oh it's delicious I just fit on this bins Clive resin pen that I got I mean make a yes yeah I was kind of jealous didn't leave one for me [ __ ] amazing man it's a live resin pen yeah it's it's and it really does taste yeah it's like cannabis turps is what it tastes like because it is cannabis chirps it's a distillate pen so it's distillate that's in there but then they reconstitute it with so they use distillate all from one strain and reconstitute it with the terpenes they separated from that strain so you if you have all that you get the entourage effects because all the terpenes that were pulled out are there again so it's kind of like the whole when they bleached flour and they bleep got all the nutrients out of it and then again yeah it's fortified but we put in but in the in the good weed way so yeah we were talking about that when Jordan was here we were talking about from Ben square talking about how you can smoke a whole shitload of dabs and it just doesn't get you the same high that smoking you know really solid joint will and that is that entourage effects as much as I don't like to be part of the hype man it's absolutely true just smoke flour and Deb's and you're good that's what the a lot of people do you know you'll smoke a couple of dabs and get a really high THC boost and and it just smoked a flower to get the to get the entourage effect got all right I got ass alright enough of it but yeah as much as I don't want to say it it's legit and you know you can smile I when I was in Florida I was smoking those dabs all day long out of that pen you know really powerful wax good quality wax and I didn't feel that high you know it was when I look back at pictures I was like holy [ __ ] your eyes are toasted they just didn't make me feel a thing when I came back smoke to join the first couple days with you guys doing the show I could really do the show it's a different time man nothing is like coal plant like token on flower is my favorite hide but I'm not saying I'm anti concentrate high but it's definitely different high you're not getting whole plant you know you're not so it is like that brown bag weren't you saying it though it's like drinking beer out of a brown bag when you're when you're when you're smoking out of your dad pen it's like you don't think that anybody knows but everybody [ __ ] knows hey I'm a big fan of the koozie Pepsi and a Bud Light right very similar when they're in koozies yeah but who the hell is gonna drink Bud Light yeah I wanna know what's up yeah he's gonna bring it up man about edibles man we were thinking about over on High Times they don't they launched and off anybody else's watched much over there but they launched like a TV like it can get available on your roku or they push the app out there trying to push the video content more maybe a tied in with some of the YouTube stuff and grow videos sure but I caught that video about the couple I think it's got like the high couple and they ate they mm man a thousand milligram animal and then somebody commented like thousand milligram brownie sign me up and I'm like how do you measure this do you guys know goo you got some minutes like how do you measure when you're making edibles I'm sure it's kind of hard at home like what color I just assume just go ahead and assume it's sixty percent THC by weight so if you have a gram that's of shatter that's point six grams of actual pure THC in there so you can get your dosage that way so you just guesstimating is what you're doing I mean without without having a shatter analyzed roof I mean if you got it from a dispensary or have a readout on it where it got tested you can go buy that but if without doing that just a good guess at shatter would be from fifty to sixty percent I'm not even talking to him just my homegirl harvested some flower and I'm gonna make some whip out the magical butter machine and make some coconut oil or butter it's at that point it's really hard as a home crafter to say oh these are 25 milligrams what just from Keith I guess I mean there's formulas for figuring it out from Keith to if you do if you dissolve all the kief into coconut oil I don't know probably 40% or 35% I would have said my weight from the Keith but I mean it's all without getting stuff tested it's just two guesstimation yeah we always we would go ahead dad's you know I'd give him to my dad or my friend's dad and see what happened we had to try on someone with a low tolerance yeah that's what I mean we never knew my buddy we travel with cookies when we use the road trip and stuff and be in prohibition land because it was safe and he'd have two types of cookies one was strong as these are the strong ones and one was not the strong one so it's like that's kind of with edibles when I make coconut oil I will you know you could take a teaspoon of coconut oil and just before you bake with it or would ever try that teaspoon right and then you don't see what it does to you for a couple of hours and be like okay that's not anger to engage the strength of your before you bake with it and that was a good way to know that these are gonna be this strong I can make them that strong but I think it's kind of hard as a home cook to get it dialed down depending on your resources and where you got your material two milligrams per piece yeah I mean I welcome the conversation but I think you got to kind of make a batch and it starts I like your test give it to somebody that's the best way you start slow though you know yeah definitely I do I would not want to get anybody on you know looking at those cats on that show after having 500 milligrams some people I guess can do 500 they're like whatever and I'm not against that but yeah I've had it happen edibles can creep and it's a different kind of high it's different as well my skin is now hei silence are you still not smoking much yourself I you know I started smoking again but I crazy adjourned yeah I couldn't help it he can't he rolled like three joints in an hour and they were awesome delicious I just had a smoke with them man but that might yeah but took me about two days is Saturday and Sunday the whole weekend I didn't smoke and and I felt a bunch better it's kind of funny cuz I think Kyle warehouse Kyle smoked over the weekend and he came into work a little bit of huffing and puffing Monday not feeling so good man so kind of felt good about taking the weekend off but I was just wondering about that and you know you hear all this stuff about about cigarettes being so bad for you it's the smoke that's bad for you right you know actually they cancel each other out I always love first this reminds me of like I'll see a guy sometimes get up to the top of a rigorous climb on a mountain bike in it take a break to have a smoke not common or you see back in the day the guy is doing the Tour de France like smoking cigarettes while they're racing and [ __ ] yeah but Jesus it's there's a health factor involved I think with cannabis I mean you're gonna you're doing more you're doing better to your body with your enjoyed can't cannabinoid system than harm I think that it would cancel out the potential effects I mean cigarette smoke tobacco smokes not even comparable to cannabis that's what I wanted to do a little bit of research and learn a little bit about am i doing the same thing to my lungs that I if I was smoking a couple cigarettes if I'm smoking a couple joints and what I found out was that you do put car into your lungs cannabis has tar so when you do an unfiltered loosely rolled cigarette a little joints you are putting tar into your lungs a lot less and it's a different type of tar and chemical makeup that your body can readily expel out of itself your cigarettes are has a lot of cancerous materials in it that marijuana do it's lacking and it sticks and stays in your lungs and coats them and I mean you can look at pictures of people who now on versus a non smoker versus smoker sure and pictures of their lungs from autopsy and their I mean you could look at and definitely see which one is the smoker yeah definitely and and the cannabis has these can we look at pictures and rastafari lungs yeah there's just pot leaves coating them sure that wasn't doing tons of because a man is coughing up a lung over the weekend man you know makes it makes you think what am i doing you know I got out the vaporizer over the weekend you know or when I when I started smoking again you know that that that's nice and easy on your lungs but but you also got to think cigarette smoke and tobacco just in general as an agricultural crop is one of the dirtiest filthiest pops ever and think about it this way so imidacloprid isn't neonicotinoid poison for the like most popular ones being used right now it is declining yeah it's a nicotine based pesticide they use lots of those on tobacco that you actually tobacco is one of the dirtiest it's just sprayed with pretty much the kitchen sink and in terms of the soil it's completely detrimental to the soil in three years it's stripped everything out of there and it's almost unform abble at that point geez so tobacco is just in general pretty bad and then when you know it's getting sprayed with all this [ __ ] that you're then smoking I know I'm most cannabis growers I know are pretty conscious about what they're spraying on their plants here I'm trying to just throw the kitchen sink at it sure I'm busy trying to researched our marijuana tar and lungs and it's like depends on who funded the study kind of thing just avoid the like Marlboro or Winston or Philip Morris [ __ ] oh here's image here's imagery of vapors lungs versus smokers once in the vapors long yeah just look like because clean is can be perfect in about like my conscience show I got one THC protects against lung cancer studies show that THC may offer the lungs protection from cancer-causing effects of smoke and this is dr. Tosh gene okay dr. Tashjian explained in a 2012 interview a time it says in the THC in marijuana has well-defined antitumoral effects that had been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancers and animal models and tissue culture systems thus counteracting the potential tumor illogical effects hahaha Pro carcinogens and marijuana smoke I feel like I should smoke just for getting through that yeah this is leap science whose elite science yeah yeah by the way what this made in doing the research here made me understand that you can't trust anybody like I'm like do I trust leaf science and I'm like well I don't trust CBS or time or NBC I like I trust either of those the same as leaf science and well this is just an article with all stock photos from Shutterstock on it and not a single bit of sourcing or bibliography to go with it so generally that's a red flag to me that hey we use some fancy buzzwords and it's [ __ ] in this entire article really nice quote from dr. Tichina man look at that font bro glasses and must be true if it's leaf science yeah alright yeah I move on to over on YouTube Fleetline tails cracking me up he goes hey you don't want that guy that maintains the dead engine to beat high huh I'm the guy that makes the parts inside the jet engine and I'm high as [ __ ] I get high with that guy man all right man you see high by himself the definition man that's it's all and people can have talked about it before a bad you know feeling all that person's high or that like it my Mike it'll hear on the radio don't drive stone it's like so what in that I guess I did you know give you that look man when that that's all the weird is common I think I've seen on the show directed towards me this morning someone wants me to pregnat his daughter we're cleaning YouTube all right let's go to hey I did we got a fall for ambition port here and I want to kick it let's play this fall bread a little bit of prohibition report you guys have been calling into though it is at the eight three three four twenty twenty four twenty you got it over on dude gross calm it's up at the top left and we've been getting some calls so you guys that have called in will be featuring your [ __ ] but hey play this one this is out of a new higher it yeah hey what up guys love the show just a twenty-year-old grower live in New Hampshire and New England living in New Hampshire you live in between Massachusetts Vermont Maine and they're all slightly ahead of the medical and even a bit recreational so it creates a bit of a black hole market within the New Hampshire cannabis market so you can fell much much higher from taking stuff from Maine or Vermont and bringing it over to New Hampshire because it's pretty strict and it seems like law enforcement is the reason why and pass because quite frankly a lot of the profit comes from cannabis bust in New Hampshire and law enforcement do profit off of it in some way or some form but yeah you know I work at a hydroponic grow shop in New Hampshire and it's pretty legit we have a lot of people come over over the border to support it and I've been working under caregivers since I was 16 and a couple more months so I'm 21 and everything can be a [ __ ] it oh yeah shout out to the Jews grows keep it going so that's very cool I mean think I appreciate the update gave us a little market update let's talk about that for a second because I've actually been in New Hampshire before man I drove through there and there are some super rural sections but it's not too far from you know from Massachusetts and Boston and all that stuff so he's saying they've got a huge black market still there man very interesting no I mean there's gonna be a black market anywhere until all the states are legal like imagine the last state it's everywhere around it is is illegal but people are fighting over that like market but anyway there's still plenty of black market because there's not how many fully legal states do we have now we got what organ Washington's your Colorado I think Alaska yes or maybe like six or seven Washington DC yeah so man there's tons of black market so that oh yeah what does that mean and get yet guys get any report so we'll be playing some more and appreciate it but it doesn't remind you of like now that the cops are out busting we're gonna check something out in the news here in a second about that they're still busting people man and I mean like you go up there's there is still a black market that's it's alive and well and I'm kind of happy about that actually okay I don't know yeah I don't know man why do I always have to buy my pot in the store again I also go into the fact of why do I have to feel that I'm a - well you know so having the black market keeps ability for the man to get me into the system what everybody also run the risk of you could also just make a ton of money and not get caught by the man yeah you know I was kind of helping you make all that money yeah but about it I got a something that I have two friends that did three solid years for just sitting in a 20 lighter two separate people that were just kind of just didn't have much going on and life decided to grab their balls and go for it and then [ __ ] got caught and they lost three years of their lives man in their 40s and whatnot and that's a long [ __ ] time to sit in a cage alright so in the news first off I hope everybody out in Hawaii isn't getting too wet man that hurricane was thrown I think Hawaiian DGC out there you know what's up and joel bob but by 12 inches of rain in a couple hours and that kind of [ __ ] and like on one island they're gonna be like 30 inches of rain at craziness so yeah i hope everything is hanging okay out there but they did say in a story I was like so what happens when the news tells you it's gonna rain a lot there might be mudslides and this and that everybody runs to the store goes Hawaiian residents rushed to the stores to stock up on bottled water ramen and toilet paper so I guess those are the staples with its disaster time well with the ramen of course I get TP because everybody wants some TP like it's just insurance interesting to see like the top three items you know my wife was away for a week and I started the Uniting go to the grocery store I really didn't give a [ __ ] about food and I was just kind of looking to see like the last things that I could eat yeah that's Robin macaroni and cheese and ramen are kind of the things and I was like you know I was on that preservative kicks I wouldn't look and sure enough they're just loaded with all sorts of potassium sorbate and sodium phosphate oils weird [ __ ] man oh yeah you're gonna eat rum you should probably make your own broth not use the broth packet even the ramen itself as well I got my wine is this stuff like it's like borderline plastic why can no microbes like like microbes are living things and nothing living will even touch me for years figure out how plastic and feed the world might be able to solve two huge problems all right X news story Scottie this is you oh yeah man I can't I'm so sorry I don't have to somebody shared with this with me and Dan Chinese got busted again we kind of know of this guy from years ago and did you say Dan try like DN Dan Dan Chinese man oh I thought you were saying the damn Chinese got by Mike wait wait wait all right this is titled Denver police raid massive network of illegal grows in Colorado yes what was interesting about this they had on one block I think they said they rated six houses on one block and I'm pretty sure is mostly all asian people it goes the raids are targeted at a number of Asian restaurants which I've seen this firsthand they tie arrests you know just like you used to joke about the pizza place right sure but the restaurants you know they'd be the money laundering aspect of it and yeah pretty in I mean pretty interesting and what was your point in this story as far as you see I see pictures of all these plants they uprooted lane in the driveway oh that's a bad day yeah so what is this about I mean you can go buy this stuff in the stores right my point of this is the cops really do seem like they're on a power trip and like they're out of control on a power trip they go and they confiscate whether they get the guy's house or they get all the equipment or they get the cars they make money from these busts these buster are a revenue you know profit Center for the police they confiscate cars from it and and they just I mean this wasn't a single person with a home grow growing to supply himself this was basically this is a criminal enterprise running grow houses and selling out of state and wherever they can supply medicine out of state man wouldn't want people to get weed out of state would we no but you can look at it that way for sure I I nothing should happen from growing this plant but the bottom line you know you know there's Scotty is their there their money laundering they're bypassing the man if you will and that's it they're gonna have more serious charges on organized crime and not paying taxes and [ __ ] then they probably can these people but like I mean you you really you think that this is a good exemplification of what like cannabis in Colorado is like that people should I mean because Colorado affords us a lot of Rights it's Colorado sisters when it comes to cannabis sure we're allowed to carry what 2 ounces on you if you're a resident and you have a medical license it can be up to like 5 pounds right you can grow 12 plants at your house have six flowering six not mm-hm and they afford us a lot of rights in that respect sure I mean so as soon as I somebody suspects that I have too many plants in my house and the police the appropriate response for the pole I don't think that this was someone suspected they had too many plants in the house they I'm sure they caught these people with sales before they actually had sure warrants to go in there okay so and selling out of state I mean I mean this is as an advocate and think that this is [ __ ] up but they're in one of the most legal states and like free thinking when it comes to cannabis and they were they were violating the laws that Colorado affords absolutely so so knock on their door and have a conversation with them about it don't go in there with violence and and flash grenades and guns and I mean I see this whole world of violence that we have man and we make it ourselves man you know if you don't want if you don't want people shooting at each other man and don't show up and have explosions to gain access to the house I mean these guys are using flash grenades and showing up at a case I've been a victim of this [ __ ] man I've had an area none any K but a what is it now what are they use man ar-15s man yeah I've had cops bust in my house man have me my wife and my very little kid at gunpoint scared the [ __ ] out of us within his legal limit of plants right within had nine plants is what they got me with man and they treated me like a criminal couldn't give a [ __ ] about it and it just reminded me of a smash-and-grab you know there's a lot of variables of for law enforcement going into homes or whatever you know and I totally agree with what you're saying Scotty in the sense I mean you're not a registered firearm owner you know if law enforcement finds out that firearms in a home it's gonna be approached differently but yeah and there's a lot of different variables in how law enforcement acts and we've heard everything as horrifying as it's all getting shot - bangs being thrown in a kid's room like a flashbang and [ __ ] like that a dog getting shot what do you mean it's a miracle if your dog lives through a police raid bro as a member of my family man that's [ __ ] up yeah I agree in this situation this just ties in - yeah I mean you can't be cheating like you know the feds look at it as organized crime and tax evasion Alexis yeah and it being a bunch of being a bunch of Asians or Chinese does not help their cause I'm sure yeah so this is but I just think it's so crazy how quick the government is to come to violence when it comes to not paying their taxes this is a tax issue right here and so what do they do they bring in flash grenades and big you know big intimidation factor yeah tons of guns and ruining people's reputations in the neighborhood can't go back to that neighborhood anymore you know why cuz you had too many plants maybe because you're trying to make a little bit of extra money so selling some weed because everybody else is I just don't see why you got to ruin people's lives over it I agree sir yeah yeah you want to feel good story cuz as long as I do sir it's not bad it's just interesting man this is uh out of Bloomberg and it's this is how the press just I think today and it was Scott's miracle-gro tests whether it can make pot grow to such a creative article such a huge so so Scott's miracle-gro as betting as fertilizer can help cultivate a different kind of grass that's pretty key to adorable Jesus because Hawthorne gardening Ohio based companies best known for its gardening products but it has teamed up with a Canadian pot producer flower Corp how that's flour let's name it flour corn yes that's perfect yeah to build a 50,000 square foot research facility in British Columbia madam a vegetable crank at a job whoa and the lab will initially is gonna be used test Hawthorne's lights and nutrients on cannabis now what does that mean does that just mean botanic air gh Gavita I guess that means that they're going to invest in an R&D facility so that they can prove that their [ __ ] works and start coming out with a bunch of media hype I said win to the boycott start I'm just curious as I said they're gonna beat this facility is gonna use to test Hawthorne's lights and nutrients I'm assuming that's the companies they've already acquired that they're just trying to get because those companies botanic hair and gh haven't been able to directly ever show their products alongside your campus right sure so we have less durability up here what's that I'm just looking at posted it says keep your friends close and your enemies closer you know we've got these big alcohol companies coming in they've got these huge Lobby you know these losers lobbying power I don't know man you know yeah I don't like the real big out like that consolidation Branson and it's hard to swallow that pill like we've said because they've spent money on campaigns against cannabis so the way that the world works there's rules of power you know and I mean and you're not gonna it's not like oh well it's not fair because you guys hated us before and now that there's money to be made you like us so you know I mean it doesn't work like that they're gonna come in and they're gonna take yeah yeah yeah I agree as well as you know the small business [ __ ] man that stuff's important small business model small businesses you know like yourself with recharge you definitely you know what do I do the factory gets gets bought by Scott's a miracle girl I don't hold all the cards in this man interesting for that facility I'm not to see where it is I've never visited a 50,000 square-foot facility we like to check it out yeah you probably your first day at work there you'll be uh he doesn't feel great I mean she's man if I had a you know I might try and figure it out if that was my passion but no and he can't take that money you ain't a man or invented I used to sweep the fertilizer aisle at the place called Builders square the Midwest back in the day when I was like 16 17 I made it never wore the mash they're like where the mash to get all dusty so I'm just waiting [ __ ] dude never wore the mask means or even already put it in the bag man before do you guys like what you're here and do grows calm work / value we're going to be hitting it up every show all the time it's where to go to keep us on the air don't think don't force us to do the member trip - I've you know like NPR shuts down programming yeah I can start talking about where they gonna shut it down they played clips of like some of their best stuff kind of cool okay and then they come back no they're like now that we've made you cry please or you know would like

horse I'll tease out guys stay higher [Music] yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] to do [Music] medicine [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "LzG0f5N5P-8": "[Music] and welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is Tina and so this video is gonna be my review on my favorite CVD products this video is so widely requested that I'm doing it while I'm sick I owe you guys a few different videos but I'm trying to get them done now so I'm sorry for my delay I started posting about using CBD as some of you may have so over the past year I started about a year and a half of half ago of just using strictly CBD products before that I was getting CBD products from a medical office in Manhattan so I was using it mixed with THC which I personally did not enjoy I do not like the kind that has THC in it when I started researching that there's companies that have just CVD products I found the one I'm about to show you which is sugar and cush and what a game-changer I'm obsessed I'm so obsessed that's why I've been posting about it I've been posting about it for a long time and I wanted to share it with you guys because I know a lot of you are into the same things and you're interested in using CBD for a variety of reasons I received countless dm's about what do I do for stress relief what do I do to sleep and things along that things within that nature probably because I've expressed before that I have trouble sleeping I've never said that I have anxiety but I think in 2020 we all have anxiety so we need new ways to calm down and get our sleep in and a lot of us are doing a million different things so I just feel like we all have trouble sleeping now for myself I've had trouble sleeping my whole life it is so frustrating I've went years with insomnia I've always had trouble sleeping if I forget my CBD I will still have trouble sleeping I have to bring it with me when I travel I have to figure out ways to get myself to go to sleep because it doesn't happen naturally for me don't know why I've been like this my whole life so anyway getting into the products I've been kind of sick I'm trying to push through but it is so annoying because you'll be okay but to talk the congestion Oh I've actually been I think you see PT all day just so I can relax and try to sleep through the day and get better and then it prompted me to do my makeup and do this video so I have all my favourite products here and I've already put these on Instagram but I wanted to share it with you and I'll leave the link down below because as a partner or what do they call us as an ambassador I have a code and I've been sharing the code with you for so long but I'll leave it down below and on the screen I believe it's Tina 15 and you get money off from your purchase I use my own code and I'll tell you why because I had what cookies to do this video and to try them because I usually just have the drops and the gummies so I bought the cookies and I wanted to try them on this video what had happened was I ate them before filming the video I ate all of them I'm about to finish the boxes that I finished so that I bought I have about three more boxes I figured I'll have one for the house and I'm going to bring two to my best friend's birthday party which is Saturday and guess what let me just show you so the cookies are made in the u.s. it was that too loud the cookies are made in the US and they have low carbs really low sugar they're vegan there it's all in the Box actually so here's the bag it comes in I'm gonna take a cookie out and show you so they're gluten and dairy free 100% vegan my favorite flavor is only 15 calories per serving a serving is a cookie and what a lifesaver because I've been on my dream body journey so having cookies is not in the make for that having these cookies are because they're only 15 calories so even if you wanted one a day as like your breakfast treat or as your dessert you absolutely can and I sugar and cush thank you so much they're also made in the US and I think these have I'm looking in the mirror and these have 200 milligrams of CBD these have 25 milligrams of CBD in them sorry I'm linked backed up so I could read the box and the calories each cookie only has 2 grams of carbs 1 gram of protein 1 gram of sugar I mean you could read all of the ingredients down here and they're really simple which I appreciate I don't like when something has way too many ingredients that makes me kind of like nervous I don't want to eat it I'm trying to be very organic in my new lifestyle and my favorite there's no THC I don't know about some of you but from me I don't respond well to THC I'm not gonna get into it but I don't respond well some of you do that's great you can use this in combination with whatever other remedies you used to go to sleep and relax but for me I cannot have THC ok the other thing I love is let's just be honest not everyone understands CBD I'm hoping we get to a place and a video like this will be helpful I'm hoping we get to a place where everyone understands how helpful CBD is but there's people who don't understand so to have it in the discreet cookie to take with you on the go to work to travel is so helpful and they taste really really good so they're nice to have out at parties and things like that I'll show you what it looks like cuz this is my favorite favorite snickerdoodle I love I love cinnamon like I really love cinnamon how many do I have left ok I ate a bunch there's eight in a bag and I only have two left it has cinnamon sugar all around the outside it tastes like oh I mean it is a real cookie but it tastes like any other cookie and I am a sweets expert the other flavors are just as good because let me tell you I leave one chocolate chip 50 left the chocolate chip cookie has a few more calories I think each cookie flavor varies but that's just because you have to have chocolate chips in it here's how the chocolate chip cookie looks it is so good it's not too hard it's not like a brick and it's not super soft either and they're in the stealable bags so they stay pretty fresh but they're not gonna last long enough for you to need it to stay fresh for a long time I promise you that I kept the box to show you but you don't actually need the box and here is cookies and cream cookies and cream is so good these have a little bit more calories it's 85 calories per serving 25 milligrams of CBD and same amount of cars for carbs 3 grams of fat and 3 grams of sugar so it's not that much more it's still just it's still enough and there's only two of these left as well I eat tons of cookies so embarrassing like here's not the cookies and cream looks it is so good even if you're just dieting and you use this in combination with the drops or if you want a low carb cookie in the house maybe you're on keto or something these cookies are definitely it I'm definitely ordering more sorry to my friend because I was supposed to bring these to her party guess I'm not doing and also the gummy bears I love the gummy bears but let me just tell you I love gummy bears I used to eat a bag of gummy bears a week back went back when back when not recently but I love them I have to resist them I no longer eat regular gummy bears anymore these gummy bears have one carbohydrate there's tons of CBD gummy bears out there and I used to have a different brand over a year ago but the carbs and the sugar was too much like that is a fast way to gain weight these have one carb zero protein zero sugar zero fat I don't know how they made them but all of the ingredients and everything is on here and these again there's 30 gummy bears in a container and one gummy bear has 25 grams of CBD which is pretty great and there really good I'm almost at these two sometimes I'll just chop on one during the day look if I wanted pizza candy I have a CBD gummy and it doesn't make me too sleepy it's just relaxing okay and then moving on to the drops the drops are the easiest form in my opinion because it's more concentrated and you could put them in other things so you could put them in your lattes you were your coffee in the morning like if you like creamer with your coffee you could replace it with the vanilla flavor the vanilla flavor is so good it is soaked I got one for my friend who wanted to experience EVD he blew through a bottle of the vanilla in a week I thought that was so funny like what were you doing just sucking on the sucking on the dropper let me show you I keep them in the box only because they're glass here's the nola this has 500 milligrams and I believe you could choose there's different options so you don't have to have 500 I think there's ones with lesser milligrams it smells so good and it comes with the dropper so you know how much you're actually dropping into your mouth and there's already recipes online on how to bake with these I haven't gotten to that place I love to bake some going to but you can bake with them you can mix them in your food you could put it in your coffee and it's not too oily I put them in my lattes all the time I make be good vanilla lattes and I use the dropper instead of regular vanilla extract another favorite flavor is creamsicle orange creamsicle this is so good if especially if you'd like orange creamsicles I loved those as a kid and I have cotton candy this one I saved because I haven't tried this yet I wanted to try it I've never had this flavor it's so fun experimenting with the flavors well I don't know about you but I love new treats like I said follow those those Instagram accounts with all the new stuff that comes out like the new Oreos I'm totally a fat kid so I love having new sugary flavors hold on let me get this I don't want to go to bed yet so I'm gonna just do a little bit oh my god you know what it tastes like do you remember the ice cream truck that had the ice Popp oh my god was my favorite ice pop and it was cotton candy it was blue and pink and it was always the coldest ice pop like I feel like you would burn not burn your tongue but almost like ice burn your tongue on it do you guys remember that this tastes just like if I can find a picture of it I'm gonna put it right here this tastes just like that okay so I can't pick a favorite I love sweets there is no favorite when it comes to sugar and Kush I absolutely love it so I didn't want to do this video for you guys I hope that answers some of the questions and basically how I'm using that and if you feel more comfortable trying out a product I suggest the cookies especially with your hot coffee in the morning just trust me have snickerdoodle dipping in your coffee and you let me know how that goes you let me know how you feel if you like them and then pick up the drops if you need them to go to bed because I feel like it's much more relaxing you could do a few drops you lay in bed and you relax you could put them in your bath and there's new bath balm coming I saw that I ordered some because who doesn't love a bath bomb and I just really want to see like what does the dudes is it really make you sleepy I hope I was able to answer some questions about the stuff that I loved from sugar and cush and what I use them for and if it works for me if you happen to her questions definitely leave them down below if I was a little chaotic and all over the place I am on cold medicine and I'm so just out of it from not feeling that well but hopefully you got what you needed from this video and that's it so all the information is gonna be linked down below again leave a comment let me know if you have any other questions I'll do my best to answer them and that's it I hope I see you next time bye [Music] [Music]

with this this bar I feel like I miss - again if you small CB did and it shows you the percentages of the THC and it yes it's bare minimum to almost none however what they test their batch you got the canopy buds you got the middle buds you get some small bust those numbers can vary it for instance you buy an ounce of the grape diesel which is what I reviewed today you may get different levels mixed in there you know what I'm saying it's not 100% consistent in fact not only that you most likely fail drug test I'm speaking from experience I took a whole bunch of the da I went to Dollar Tree

they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are mmmmmm like smooth it's so much just like melting your novel it's amazing hey guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to replicate and infuse my favorite chocolate bar from Purdy's I don't know if there's a party's in the States but in Canada we have lots of them and they have really good chocolate and they make this amazing chocolate bar that's white chocolate with sprinkles and pop rocks and is so good it is like the best ever only difference is that ours is going to be infused with coconut oil here's what you're going to need white chocolate sprinkles pop rocks and the most important ingredient coconut oil so this is the mold I'm gonna use for my chocolate bars and I'm not sure how much chocolate I'm going to need to melt so I'm just gonna have put my little chocolate wafers in here to kind of like visualize approximately how many I'll need so I think that looks about good I might need a little bit more a little bit less so we'll find out but I just don't want to melt too many if I don't need to since this is the only mold I have for a little chocolate cute little chocolate bars so I'm just gonna put the chocolate into my Pyrex measuring cup but a bowl or anything is fine I'm just shooting to use the pirate so that I can pour it out after so I'm gonna put this in the microwave for about 45 seconds so 45 seconds is third melting a bit ruin and stir it we don't want to over melt the chocolate or it will get like chunky so you just have to melt it slowly and then stir it melt a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in for 20 seconds that was 20 more seconds and it is perfectly melted now and then we're going to add in two tablespoons of our coconut oil so my coconut oil is just that partly room-temperature partly melted it would be best if I had this sitting on the thread shows fully melted that way I could put it into the the chocolate a little bit easier and measure it out but I just scooped it I was fine too now I shouldn't have to microwave this again because the heat from the chocolate should melt the quill but I might not do it we'll find out just keep stirring it a bit to just warm it up and melt it so I think it keeps me melted a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in the microwave for like ten seconds and I do want to make some of my chocolate bars Oreo so I'm gonna have like a mix so I'm just gonna bring up some Oreos and add them to some of the moulds okay there is our ten seconds and you can still see little coconut chunks but I'm just kind of stirring them in and pressing my spoon against them to melt them there's still a little bit of Trump so I'm just let this sit here and melt a bit more while I put my Oreos into my bowls just gonna break them up and put them right into the mold I think that I don't know like should I do them with Oreos and sprinkles like these ones over here all gonna be the sprinkle and pop rock ones but these two I want to be Oreo but it just like should I also have sprinkles I don't know okay we'll save that to add on top okay so that those little chunks have melted a bit you can mix that in and I feel like we're probably gonna need a little more chocolate like that doesn't look like enough for all these but before I add in my sprinkles and my pop rocks I'm just gonna fill up the Oreo ones now maybe a little bit more Oreo on top I'll crush these ones a little bit finer those look good it's like cookies and cream I wish I would have crush the other ones this small kind of looks a little bit better mmm it smells like cookies and cream okay now for the other ones that I'm gonna do top rocks and sprinkles I could mix it directly in here and then pour it in but I kind of want to pour it in and then add it so we'll see how this goes I think I'm gonna have to make more anyway and obviously you can use any fillings you want like you could add any sort of like cookies you could add mint flavoring you could do like marshmallows oh you can do anything you want okay I do need a melt a little more this will just be like a mini one maybe just like those like Hershey bars you get a Halloween okay now I'm gonna add the pop rocks cotton candy how good is that gonna be with this is anybody else is just like love cotton candy flavored things like what do you have flavor is cotton candy I just feel like it's sweet flavor okay it's open these up let's see what color they are okay so they're pink I would have liked it they weren't pink to be honest because like I really want to see them but they might blend damn with the sprinkles so we should probably be fine today I'm just gonna kind of like mix them in like how much do we want it there you'll see a man sprinkles now sprinkles are the best part I like lots of Franco I like the crunch of them in there and we're just gonna mix them in again my god this looks so good so I filled up my molds with chocolate and put my toppings in them and then I'm just gonna put them in the fridge for like I don't know 20 minutes 30 minutes we'll find out how long it takes alright guys they've been in the fridge for about half an hour and they are ready to come out so we're just going to pop them on out of their molds but we're gonna do it gently so we don't break the chocolate while it's coming up guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are okay the best part tasting them ah mm-hmm-hmm oh we have the extra sprinkles hmm yes oh these are so good they're almost better than the one from Perry which is weird cause like I use pretty cheap chocolate but I'm thinking the coconut oil being added like smooth it so much just like melt in your mouth is amazing thank you guys so much for watching please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe and I hope you have a wonderful day [Music]", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "_ye7_mXKUuk": "[Music] the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are talking high five chuckles again high five chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "-n15F_K5R8I": "[Music] if you've not seen any of our videos before my name is Brandi and I own green wellness life we are a three women operation here in West Michigan trying to help people live healthier lives to come so let's talk about edibles briefly we get lots of questions a couple of different types of edibles one of them really can replace your daily capsule or tincture or any other method that you're using to take in CBD on a daily basis anything that you're digesting is going to work in the same fashion so people ask me well do I need a gummy and a capsule no not so much really it's one or the other and we always tell people the best CBD is the one that you'll actually take so if what you'll actually take is a gummy or a chocolate bar you're in luck we've got them so we have isolate broad spectrum and full spectrum in edibles so we've got all three categories and a variety of strengths those three categories mean you can get full spectrum product everything in the plant in the ground ends up in your platinum and some of your products including that teeny bit of THC or broader isolate means that that THC is gone we've got you covered both ways we have some awesome full spectrum products from Charlotte's Web therapeutic chocolates and then I've got lots of other gummy choices that are broad-spectrum or isolate as well so really all over the board chill shots are another way that you can take that CBD every day again going through to the digestive system so it's going to function in the same capacity as that capsule or tincture raw paste any other way that you're eating your CBD now if you're looking for something a little faster that's what we would consider a booster in this case boosters are going to absorb through your cheek and we've got two different gums or a mint they're going to get to work more quickly but an edible that you're digesting but they won't last as long in your system they're not going to bind to your lipids and keep working for you long term the title of booster means just that again and pretty quick help you when you need it and then get back out again so gum and mints are an option they're those work great in addition to an edible or a capsule or tincture any other way that you are eating your CBD daily I hope that this has helped give you a quick run-through of what it means to be inedible in the CBD world we are always here if we can answer any questions for you you can email us at support at green wellness life com give us a call at eight eight seven seven two seven eight seven five or you can reach out through social media or online chat as well we would love to help you hope you're having a great day thanks for watching [Music] you", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies? check out our AsAP stop video that breaks down the science behind that by clicking the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday", "vPszR0-vTqc": "We all know to stay away from poisons. Like mercury where ingesting a 200 milligram dose would kill you. Or polonium which only requires 1 g of vaporized substance to wipe out 50 million people! But did know that 70 cups of coffee contains enough caffeine to kill a 70 kg person? This amount of caffeine can trigger heart palpitations or even cardiac arrest. Prefer alcohol as your beverage of choice? 13 consecutive shots could be lethal too. Because alcohol is a depressant, the area in the brain controlling basic life functions like breathing and heart rate brgin to shut down. Too much liquid in general can be dangerous as well. Though it takes a lot, water intoxication from around 6 liters causes brain cells to swell, leading to headaches, seizures, comas and even death in extreme cases. But if you stop drinking water or consume too much salt, your cells will start to shrink leading to the condition known as hypernatremia. 48 teaspoons of your favourite seasoning at once is enough to trigger this reaction, also leading to seizures, coma or even death. Stick your head underwater or simply hold your breath and it takes around 4 minutes without oxygen to cause severe brain injury and at 6 minutes, you could die. However, in extreme cases, some freedivers have been able to hold their breath fo over 20 minutes. Cherries can also deprive you of oxygen. Say what? If you ever swallow a cherry pit, you shouldn't worry too much, just don't bite into one. 1 or 2 ground cherry pits contains enough cyanide to take you down. And these cyanide ions inhibite the enzyme cytochrome coxidaze, causing your cells to be unable to use oxygen. Speaking of a lack of oxygen, it's at around 8000 meters above sea level that our bodies can no longer acclamatize to delemited oxigen this is known as the \"death zone\" in mountaineering simply

done was April so we were just trying to like blend it all and we had to get rid of some of my blonde of course with low lights too blended nicely so that the top didn't look kind of funky being like one color which it still does a little bit but it's blended nicely so I'm gonna do this for a little bit and maybe go more blonde next time for my competition so we will see I don't really know I'll be back here in about five or six soare so so stay tuned on that one but I do like it overall anyways I'm going to eat a little bit more because my dad got home from work like three hours later than I

excited for a new a flavor and then last thing I got my favorite surge BCA's these are the Miami Vice and they taste so good they're phenomenal but most important I am about to try the thing this is the birthday cake flavor I've heard that it's absolutely terrible I've heard that it tastes like coconut I've heard that tastes like just really really really sweet and I love sweets so I'm kind of excited to see like what I think of it but I give this a try and let you guys know what I think alright it's going to give us a try now I was trying to set up my phone to do it for Instagram but not really working so first smells really good smells like a vanilla cake so I see why people don't like it is kind of a weird birthday cake flavor to it like a very fake flavor but I think it tastes like birthday cake it tastes good in my opinion I think it's good what is the sweetener in here sweetness to Carlos so maybe it's just a lot of sucralose I don't know but I think it tastes good yeah it tastes like a birthday cake like a kind of a fake sweetener sweet and candy birthday cake I don't know that's a hard one to nail but I think the flavor is pretty good I love sweets like I said I love sweets so if you don't like sweets this woman is not your drink but if you do love sweets like me and you love birthday cake everything then maybe give it a try you might like he might not but what's there to lose zero calories I'm gonna go lift it down so I'll see you guys later hey guys so I just got him lifting and I'm sitting in the car gonna eat my food because I got like a 30-minute drive home it's about 8:00 8:45 p.m. now I've got a baggie yeah we have green beans and 96% ground beef and then we also have some oatmeal which I'm really excited about I made this earlier and bananas

I'm watching Paul my coach on one of his YouTube videos but I sit in the car eat my food and before head drive home oh my gosh I hate him talk I'm so hungry oh but bang was actually really really good I enjoyed it the more I drink it the better I enjoyed it so go to try and let me know what you guys think have you tried it or if you want to try it whatever let me know if you try it but I'll see you guys the next flip I'll probably be at home making Matt green monster shake and I've decided to call it the Green Monster because it looks like a monster it's so ugly but it tastes so good for those of you don't know you always don't set your glasses on based off that little arrow over right here which is in every single car alright so I am Matt Casey till I got my dad's gas which is already sold by time I chopped it off even though he just filled up so if you would have never had KC's pizza you need to try it if you are ever here at KC's and Iowa wherever they are Casey's pizza is literally a life-changing so I'm actually here also because my mom thinks that she does not like Diet Pepsi and I had her taste her Pepsi is zero or one or whatever it is today and a definite empty and she liked the Diet Pepsi better she didn't know which was which but she blames it on her having just brushed your teeth so I told her I'd get another one we could try it again later so you said my dad brings these home from work fritters are my favorite they smell so good it looks so good but I'm gonna make my Green Monster and blues baby wants to say hi my baby for those of you who've never met Bailey on my channel she is a senior citizen clearly and she is turning 12 in November I got her when I was a senior and here we are nice chevron me high-five good girl oh she just loves to rub on black clothes give me kiss thank you [Music] [Music] and that chair since seriously it's so good I love it so so so much a bit key things is that the spinach is best when it's frozen because it's like ice cold right now add a little bit of water to dilute it dilute it a bit and the get opportun the fruits and vegetables or putting greens sorry this is a game changer it makes it taste so much better this is a pineapple splash flavor I had it last night and I had actually these green super whatever they are from high V and it's definitely not as good so the this is like the key to making everything tastes so good but yeah let me know if you guys have tried it or if you're gonna try it work afraid to try it because I promise it's really really good great source of potassium and just your micronutrients

done anything yet because yeah I just got back home so you know whatever but now we're here together and we're going to eat an edible that I have not eaten before and I really wanted to try this because I saw a video about it and then I was like a hot chocolate edible like does it really taste like hot chocolate um I'm a big fan of chocolate I love chocolate I love cookies I love brownies I'm all about chocolate so when I saw this I was like oh yeah I totally want to try this you know so I went into sensory and I think it's kind of a tradition of Mines that I always eat an edible on 4/20 I usually don't buy edibles just because I'm more of like a smoker person today I'm going to be reviewing the law fam\u00edlia cannabis choc a cannabis infused chocolate bar okay and this is in the flavor hot chocolate as you can see I love the packaging the color is so beautiful this is um this is a legit legit product so yeah it has basically all of your like serving suggestions and ingredients and it tells you like dosage and directions and it says to wait two hours for effects before consuming more so this is 100 milligrams I've had edibles that were literally like three 400 I think the most I've done is probably 300 milligrams and I probably like shared it with somebody so it's probably like a hundred and fifty that I did you know if I'm guessing right you know right so on the back right here it basically has its tested for life parasites and stuff EHC is nine point zero seven per serving so I already opened it up for you guys so you guys can check it out so for like each little name it's like it tells you like cuz I'm guessing the bars the bar looks like this and ten milligrams ten milligrams ten milligrams so for each serving is like ten milligrams 10.30 for CBD per package so I guess the whole package now most likely if I really enjoy this I'm probably gonna just eat all of it or I might just eat half of it I really don't know if I don't really like it I might just eat half of it and they say the other half are like tomorrow I don't know so when you open it up it comes in like this little Ziploc bags so if you don't want to eat it you know like all of it then you can totally store it yeah and then on here it basically like it's the same stuff it has like the ingredients this is Matt this is total sugars of 56 grams so and this does have like it has nonfat milk so if you know you don't consume dairy just FYI so I'm ready to [ __ ] taste this so I watched a video and they said to like do something like this and then it opens it up oh oh oh okay I'm kind of getting like a weed edge smell they they smell like chocolate and then like kind of like the Abuelita the hot chocolate the Mexican one and yeah so let's just get into it right let's just try one so this is basically 20 milligrams a one oh wow I am so sorry for my smacking I was oh my god Wow so it's literally literally it's like you know when you like eat like a chocolate chip or like the the hot chocolate that I was talking about and let's say you know you cut into little pieces or like thin little pieces and you know you make [ __ ] chocolate out of it or something this literally tastes just like that it doesn't even like taste like its own chocolate it literally tastes like hot chocolate I'm not bad at it because I don't want to try this I like it would I buy it again probably not this exact one but maybe like try something else from the brand I don't know but I can't really say if I would buy it again until I know how the high is and how much how potent it is or whatnot I mean it says 100 milligram spot and you know why like after I'm done eating it I do feel like there's a little bit of like I can taste a little bit of wheat because I'm so familiar with weed because I usually smoke almost every other day you know I just know if it has weed in it and smelling it it smells like chocolate I don't think you could really tell if you were to just give it to somebody I don't think they would know mmm so I'm loving it more and then any more of those I'm probably just gonna try to finish it I don't know or me just have half I don't know maybe I might just have half I don't know yet but I'm going to be back within an hour or two hours I know it takes like two hours for usually for edibles to kick in so I'll be back when that happens and I'm gonna tell you guys how high this got me because I want to know - just like you want to know so you know how you know that didn't even make sense that there are you guys okay you guys so I've had so far I have had I wanted to do a little update because I didn't want shot a thing that I didn't eat at all you know what I mean so I ate half of it right okay so that's 15 million absolutely it's gone she's gone so my thoughts as of right now as of just consuming 50 milligrams 50 now 60 70 um I think it's really easy to eat honestly I like it I did like let it chill in the fridge for a little bit and then take it out so it's like the perfect like chocolate consistency just because it was room time but you guys don't care about that but I don't know if it's me or if edibles hit me hard or fast or if I'm thinking they're hitting me because I'm eating this already but I already am starting to feel a little different I don't know why I mean no I don't feel like a full-on [ __ ] faded or I don't even feel high but I know I ate some edibles and they're gonna hit and I'm thinking they're already hitting but they haven't even hit yet like I haven't even been 30 minutes I gotta keep a track of time okay so I had this literally at like probably like 6:00 or 6:10 so I'm guessing by like 8:00 to 8:30 I should be feeling the effects of this so I'm just gonna finish the rest of this and then once you know I am at the peak of my fated Ness I will check in back with you guys and I will tell you my initial thoughts of is that worth it I spent around $20 on this edible you guys $20 and that's not that much you know I mean for an edible that's pretty the normal range but if I'm paying $20 and I could have gotten another edible that would have got me way more lit then I want to let you know you know but this is my first time ever trying this brand the love familiar it is a product of Los Angeles so you know I'm pretty sure it's gonna be good you know it's gonna be lit so I'm just gonna eat this up and I'll check in back with you guys as soon as I'm done with it well as soon as I feel it okay okay you guys so I'm back with another update as always I don't think you can see me all that great so I'm gonna go by my window because it's about to be getting dark so it's probably like so I finished eating my out of all it is completely gone when you show you the [ __ ] wrapper it's gone I knew it was a tough thing to do but we're [ __ ] done with her okay so now you guys can see it better this was the la familia hot chocolate product of Los Angeles cannabis infused chocolate 100 milligrams so I consumed this I think I probably did it within like 10 15 minutes I don't know not even thumbs deviants are like 10 minutes I just had to kind of eat it slow because it was a lot of sweetness going on you know and I'm not really like a sweet tooth person I mean I like sweets here and there but eating a whole chocolate bar is kind of a lot so but I did it I did it I wanted to get really lit for 420 so I'm going I basically have a timer already going for like an hour and a half so I keeps at the time and not get too high and forget about it so once I am you know one hour and thirty minutes into this then I will come back with you guys and I will let you know how my I get so you already know deal yo okay guys I wanted to do a [ __ ] update because it's like 8 o'clock like 8:30 and I definitely feel the edibles they hate hard I think next time I'll probably do like 50 because I took a couple of like puffs off of like plug and play and look how fried I am I mean I don't know if you can tell but I'm [ __ ] fried but yeah I mean I would rate that at", "-SBlSzSn6cs": "we are with another CBD 1 minute long product review this time we're gonna talk about this elite hemp

edibles that I personally have used and we're going to discuss how to basically medicate yourself with edibles because there's a whole different program then there is with dabs with marijuana with syringes with THC crystals it doesn't matter what it is has nothing to compare with edibles so let's talk about what we're gonna be looking at today we're gonna be looking at PJ butter double dose was a 300 milligram bar and PJ butters triple dose cannabis chocolate bars one is a Belgian dark choc that one is a Belgian chocolate with cappuccino regardless whether they say triple or double dose what you need to look at is the milligrams of cannabis milligrams of cannabis milligrams of THC that's the important thing because my gosh the average person I would think this is a small candy bar the size of two fingers average person can unwrap this candy bar I start munching and be done with it well don't do that don't do that this isn't marijuana edible it's going to hit you much different than anything we smoked anything doesn't matter if it's a peak doesn't matter if its distill it if it's crystals if it's this wax cigar doesn't matter what it is it's not as strong as an edible and it edible is gonna be very difficult for you to turn the volume down it's gonna be very irritating for you if it gets to that point so here is the advice you must follow start small what do I mean by start small if this was the edible this is what you start with I know I know it's gonna say I'm a baby that's all I'm bigger than that I can take more than that well you can't okay average person needs to start with about a 5 or a 10 milligram dose not 300 450 not 150 you have to start with an extremely small dose in order to do that you have to have self-control reason have self-control with this this can really make you feel uncomfortable can make you dizzy can ruin your night or ruin today so I am heavily medicated at all times because I live in chronic intractable pain okay set me aside here's what has to happen with a bar like this you don't unwrap the whole bar you slide it down very carefully in its wrapper and you take a small piece of the corner remember if it's a 300 milligram bar each tenth is 30 milligrams that's too much okay the 450 milligrams bar each tent is 45 milligrams that's too much too much for the average person too much for most of my viewers most of my subscribers and it's not a bad thing this doesn't make us web skies and gals anybody who uses edibles understands what I'm saying because we've all been to that bad spot once at least so you must follow what it says beware everybody see the nice word there beware well you have to beware okay this is not scaring you this is coaching you you have to beware that this is not going to happen to you okay so you must start and increments the size of this piece of the square of the sticky note that's right smallest piece you can pick is what you start with there was a bar I used to use when they made it that was a thousand milligrams and literally if I took crumbs off of it I would feel good so once you buy these bars or these chocolates you have to really practice with them in a small doses to understand how strong they are I guess the best way to put it is it's like baseball they train you when you were little in the outfield to always run back to try to catch the ball when it's hit because you can always run forward easier than running back to catch the wall they always train you with pain medicine take your pain medicine at a set time during the day make sure you keep it taking it regularly at a set time there any day so the pain doesn't get ahead of it because you very often have a hard time getting pain under control with pain medicine if you can take the pain medicine ahead of time or while it was happening because when it crescendos the pain medicine might not work the same thing with something like this okay you have to give this a lot of time a lot of patience okay and whether it's the pj butters which I have here the three hundred the four fifty bars or whether it's another edible don't think you're Superman or superwoman you are not okay whether it grabs you in an hour or five hours it's gonna grab you don't do it be happy go slow and enjoy your edibles this is senior stoner with the pj butters chocolate review have a great day and be careful of your animals", "WUaSrjjG1Gw": "a review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another product from the fine fine folks at G Pharma labs and

their bars both in terms of taste and potency they're never quite as good as like a kiva bar or maybe like duffel se but they are a good chocolate there's a little bit of cannabis taste to all the ones in the past but it's good quality chocolate and it always gets me nice and high this cost 15 bucks in my dispensary but I got a discount for two for 25 which is actually a pretty good deal 1250 for a 210 milligram chocolate bar that's a good deal you can't find much better than that so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work are pretty simple I'm gonna eat this chocolate bar it's not necessarily the whole thing in front of you but I'm gonna eat this chocolate bar up and then I'll actually come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process so right behind me here guys is beautiful beautiful Long Beach I'm up here in Signal Hill California Long Beach I was gonna try to get some nice drone footage for you but apparently this is a no-fly zone according to the FAA and I can't fly my drone right beautiful aerial shots so bummer you guys are just gonna have to look at me face to face sorry I know that say so here we go we've got our bar here in hand opening up this foil maybe you know you would think after all of these reviews I would be an expert and opening up packaging but I still still suck at it all righty here we go here is our liquid gold bar six different pieces you can see the name written on it they're a liquid gold liquid gold liquid gold break1 off of this ultimate milk chocolate and give it a taste hmm well let's eat chocolate a little bit of a cannabis taste good again you're not gonna hate it the quality of chocolate really helps match that cannabis flavor it's not it's not huge it's just not as good it's like a keep a bar or some of the premier high-end chocolates um but it is good and guys in terms of taste just fine the most important thing though is how it's gonna make me feel for that guys you have to wait a couple of seconds me two hours and I'll come back to you guys and let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you guys in just a bit two hours later welcome back to weed skies it has been two hours since I have enjoyed the liquid gold bar 210 milligrams ultimate milk chocolate seductive I don't know what makes it ultimate I'm guessing they don't have a regular milk chocolate doesn't matter just a solid product guys I mean just a damn solid product it's a good value it's good workhorse edible I have no problem recommending it you know it's um if you find it for like 15 bucks you're not gonna be disappointed with it you're gonna get nice and high you're not gonna hate the taste you know it's a good solid workhorse edible I've really enjoyed all the liquid gold I've reviewed I might do one more just to make sure but at this point it's pretty pretty pretty apparent that these guys know what they're doing and that you can grab a liquid gold bar and feel pretty satisfied with it so the ultimate milk chocolate you know which one's my favorite I don't know you know it's really there yeah they are all the chocolates pretty much consistent it's whatever flavor you think we would like the best from their lineup grab it grab it and go liquid gold as I said I might review one more maybe somewhere down the line but for now I think we're pretty consistent we know these guys know how to make a chocolate bar I would say I'm at a solid 7 right now somewhere right there so again I've only paid 1250 for this to 425 and that I mean it's just a good deal it's a good deal it's a good chocolate bar it's again a good it's not it's not the best that it's neither the best value and were the best tasting the edible out there but it's on the you know upper echelon its above average in in in each and in each realm so it's just a really good value I like it a lot that's the liquid gold bar ultimate milk chocolate 210 milligrams of THC I'm a fan of their stuff I'm a fan of their their chocolate bars been rambling enough thank you so much for watching wheats

did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger

to show you guys how you can eat the oil in your carts or how you can use it in edibles i'm going to show you guys how to make butter infused butter with your carts it's very easy once you get the distillate out of the carts you can use it in many different ways such as just plain straight up eating it adding it to butter you can also use it in quite a few different recipes i do have a few on my channel that i think it would go very well with such as adding it to oreos or to dummies um i'll post the links of some suggested edible videos for you guys to make below and check those out you can use the oil in most of the carts at least the ones that are distilled which if you're getting them from dispensary that's what they should be if they're ordered online it's hard for us to really know um i tried one of or some of the oil from one of mine that i ordered online and i'll show you guys the clip here of me um trying it and it really worked just straight up eating it even just a little bit of it i'm also going to show you guys in this video how to add oil to butter so you guys can have infused butter that way and in this case you guys don't need to decarb or anything like that because the thc is already activated when i show you guys how to make the butter with the oils in the cart you could also do the same thing with purchase the salad so in any recipe where it calls for half a cup of infused butter a quarter cup of whatever amount of infused butter if you don't have that infused butter that was made the traditional method you could also just add distillate to butter which is what i'm going to show you guys how to do in this video so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass today i will be showing you how to use carts and edibles or how to um just straight up eat them slash what happens when so um i have a bunch of miscellaneous cards i have um some that i ordered online a long time ago um and then i have some that are from dispensaries um and i don't really want to vape the ones that i got online i just don't know if i really trust them anymore i even have like um a whole full one that i'm probably just gonna eat somehow um but yeah so what i wasn't sure about is they should all be distilled and they definitely will be um the ones i'm getting from the dispensary i definitely know are with one's online i'm not so sure um but it's like a 95 chance that the cards that you have are just phillip um but that's what this method i'm going to show you guys is for and if it's a different type i don't um i can't confirm that it would work the same one thing i wanted to try is if i would eat some of the liquid what would happen um and i did that a few days ago i recorded it and i'll put that in here and i'll show you guys exactly what happens okay so i have one of my cards here which is mostly empty and i'm going to um consume it i don't know how much i'll see how much i can get out um and we're going to see if this is going to do anything because i don't know if i need to heat them up first for them to work or if they're just gonna um work on their own so instead of trying to just figure it out because like i said i bought these online and i don't actually know how legit they are um so we're just gonna try it and we're gonna we're gonna see if that works i'm going to i couldn't unscrew this by hand so i'm just using um a rubber glove for a little bit of grip or this isn't rubber i don't know what this is called but and then um these for some more grip and that comes off pretty easy i think yeah so there's that [Music] i guess i should turn this right here [Music] um i'm just trying to see if i can pull this thing out okay i think what i should do is put this in some i'm gonna put this in a cup of hot water first so that the uh liquid will warm up and kind of i'm just gonna place it like um this direction so when i take it off the liquid will be down here okay so i have a i just have a shot glass that i put um i filled with hot water from the top and i'm gonna place this in here um like this so that um the water will heat it up and it'll drop to the bottom where i need to access it from so i'm just popping that in there and i just made sure that there was enough water to actually cover um all the way up to here so i had to fill it up pretty high and then i figured this was probably going to cool off pretty fast so i got another bowl of just some water that i put in the microwave for about 30 seconds and i'm gonna place this into the bowl to kind of like just keep the water warm and i'm just gonna check on it every so often and then um put warmer water in there although it's already dropping down so we might not even need to change that so yeah i'm just gonna leave this here for a few minutes okay so i had to warm up the water once through this whole thing it took about like 20 minutes for it to um melt so there it is there's still a little bit there but i'll just dig it out okay so i'm just gonna dry this off there we go and then coming undone there okay so i'm just gonna use this toothpick to to get it out i'm just gonna straight up like eat it [Music] it doesn't taste bad it doesn't really taste like anything i hope this works so yeah i'm just scraping it out with a toothpick it's a little bitter and then i'm going to take a lecithin pill and i usually just take these when i take edibles just because it helps a little bit so this is how much is left in here and i'm gonna get the rest of that out which i got almost like i consumed almost all of it but the little bits they're sticking to the side i'm gonna get out when i um get the rest of all of my cartridges like when i do the whole thing which is this what this video is for um but yeah so it is 3 13 so 3 o'clock and i will report back and see if this works or if it does absolutely nothing and i'm really hoping that it works because it's gonna be so much simpler to utilize these carts um if i don't have to deal with heating them up and making sure that all goes smoothly but yeah so i'll be back in a few hours so it's been it's five o'clock so i don't know two hours oh my it worked for sure um i think it's just you know when you take some edibles and you're like oh they're not working i should take some more and then you take more and then you're like oh my god i shouldn't have taken more that's how i feel right now my mouth is so dry so dry and some juice um sorry yeah it definitely worked and i don't know how much stronger and how much more it's gonna kick in like for how long for but i can't even think straight but um this is like really good because and i didn't smoke any weed today at all the only thing i consumed along those lines was that um little cart thing so because i wanted to be sure about it like i was tempted to still hit the pen but i was like i want to be sure that if i feel something i know it's from the pen but yeah okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna reflect back more on this when i'm in another in a better state in the video part next okay okay bye oh gosh i'm so chill very very guys this hits hard okay i feel like i could have taken less you know just be careful with how much you take i think it's a very good amount that i took i think hopefully it's snowing outside also which is insane [Music] october and freezing too so yeah as we see clearly it worked very well i actually was licking some earlier and i shouldn't have because i have to make sure what i'm doing is correct and even just a little bit of it like works very well and i find i have a pretty high tolerance for edible so i was surprised how little of it it took for it to have a strong effect i'm gonna try this one that was broken i'm just gonna like lick whatever is left off of there so i was just playing around with my cartridges to see how to open each one and i was going to open this one and when i was using the pliers to turn it it wasn't i'm turning up here so i decided to put um this onto the glass part in turn and even just a little bit of pressure and it completely shattered so just an fyi when you guys are trying to figure out how to open your carts don't put your pliers directly on the glass i know it's common sense but i still did it so just fyi i don't know if we'll be able to salvage any of this i'll see what i can do but i don't really wanna end up putting a lot of glass in my mouth okay so with the broken one it's not really there's so much glass on it so i don't really know how else to use it so i'm gonna try adding it to this pipe that already has like some stuff in there it's mostly burnt um i'm gonna try and melt this into here and i don't care if there's a little bit of glass in there um because that's fine i'll just throw it out after um so let's see if this works i'm just gonna use a blow dryer to melt this off of here okay so with just using um a little bit of the blow dryer already started to kind of melt off so i'm gonna just yeah see it's a little sticky just try and like push that off into there so there's the glass in there and it was honestly very difficult to get the rest of the oil out of the cart so i kind of think you just kind of have to go with whatever chunks of broken cart you have and just kind of throw them in there so when i light this i'm just going to light it pretty much just like on the like around the glass like on the other side of it just kind of heat it up and then yeah i'm just going to hit that this looks sketchy as heck oh i got quite a bit out of that okay so let's just take a look at it after it's been smoked yeah it all came off pretty well with just a couple hits so your first step is to figure out um where your wear slash how your cards open so for a lot of them i find um you can twist them off by hand at least the ones i ordered online i find if you have um some grip just this glove here yeah now i can't open it once the camera's on okay there we go so yes that comes out um so just figure out where your cards open i assume they should all be on the top but i can't guarantee you want to put the cart so that wherever they open which for me is the tops of them um is on the bottom so that when all the liquid melts down when we open it it'll be easy to access okay so i just had a bowl of um hot water here and then a shot glass michael jackson and i'm gonna fill up that um shot glass with that hot water and then put it in the bowl with hot water to keep it nice and warm now i'm gonna take my cards and place them um with the tip up so that the distillate will fall to the tip which is where i want it to go and i'm actually just going to pour out enough water so that the um water isn't going into the the uh the part that gets screwed in but just enough to keep most of the distillate warm so it can melt properly and then we're just going to wait for this and as it cools down i'll just reheat it or add um more hot water until all of the liquid in the carts fall down which i think will take about 10 minutes ish okay so the water that i used was not warm enough so you want to make sure this water is really hot almost boiling but not boiling um and then it should take about 10 minutes so there's a couple ways you can consume these and the first would be just straight up eating it so let's start with this cartridge here i'm just gonna dry that off and then i'm gonna twist it open [Music] okay so there is our oil i'm just gonna lick this right off here and because it's really warm it came off really easily super easy to get off and then for the rest of this i'm just gonna take a toothpick and do that and then i'm just going to eat it right off the toothpick and then repeat those steps until i have ate all of this little bit of oil in here it doesn't taste the best it's not gonna lie i find that um oops the um the ones from the dispensaries taste a little better than the ones that i ordered online okay so i got pretty much everything i can get out of this one you can either throw this away or you can refill it with some more distillate and another way to eat it is similar to just eating it but if you kind of want to avoid the taste and are looking for something easy i suggest using oreos now yes these are oreo minis but you could use whatever oreos you like this is just what i had at home so i'm gonna get another cartridge here let's pull up this one isn't that beautiful that's one nice thing about getting your carts from the dispensary they're just much nicer looking much nicer looking and this one here is my favorite it's called spinach and the top part that you uh the mouthpiece it actually moves around let's see if you guys can see that see so yeah most of them don't do that so i really like that okay now we're going to open this one and i need to dry that off again too this one is a lot harder to open and while i'm doing this i'm just tasting the one that i had in my mouth and honestly it leaves a pretty gross taste i don't really love that but if you eat something else that's thick it'll probably um disguise it oh my goodness i could not get this open this is going to be an issue i have a feeling because these are from dispensaries it might be what the heck am i tightening it the wrong way so i really cannot get this one open i don't know what it is so i'm just gonna set it back and i think i'm just gonna break into it um to get the rest of the distillate out but for these oreos i'm gonna use this one to show you guys so it seems like the ones from like i said the ones from the um when you order them online or off the block market or whatever these are very easy to unscrew um but the ones from dispensaries not as much kind of makes sense because they're probably trying to avoid you from using them over again so yeah i'm just again gonna um look whatever's left off here tastes horrible i mean it's not that bad i'm being so dramatic okay and then i'm going to um use the toothpick i just have a fresh toothpick here to get the rest of this out okay so i'll just take that um right out of there and i'm gonna put it right into the middle of my little oreo and close that and then that is good to eat and i'll do the same with the other oreo here and you can put as much or as little as you want oh look at that one right here this one is made to put a whole bunch in there and guys i'm not serving these to people so don't don't be saying how nasty this this looks or is because i'm just eating it myself and then the cooler this gets the harder it's going to be get um to get out so work fast um or just put the screw the lid back on and put it back in some hot water but yeah we got most of that out okay so there's one way to do that and then the other is if you want to um use your carts in anything um that would usually require a infused butter or oil you can do that with this so here i have some melted butter this is just regular butter and then i melted it um and then i'm going to directly add my carts right into here and mix all together i'm also going to add some lecithin in here which is going to help bind the butter to the distillate as well as help our bodies absorb the thc i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own and the specific amount doesn't really matter i probably put more than i needed in there but oh well so we're going to add in our carts and all we're going to do is just scrape them into here and mix it really well and then you can use this butter in any recipe that calls for infused butter so the ratios doesn't really matter if you want to put 10 carts in here go put 10 cards if you want to do one cart just do one cart and then say you wanted to make brownies and your brownies call for half a cup of infused butter you can use half a cup of your infused butter so this is really it essentially is the same thing as if you were to add the cart directly to a um say like a batch of brownies but the thing is it would be very hard to distribute that little bit of distillate throughout the whole brownie so by putting it into the butter we're able to get the butter to go throughout all of the brownies instead of just working with you know this much liquid we're working with this much or more so now let's add these ones and so because there's such little left in these in order for me to show you guys how i would actually do this slash how you guys should do this i'm gonna um use this full cart that i haven't used yet and like i said i don't want to use the one i don't want to um inhale the ones that i had ordered online back before so this is a good way to use it so i just heated up a cup of water in the microwave it's almost boiling but not and this came in a package i'm just going to put it right in there and let it actually i'm going to turn it around so that we have the bottom going in first so we can melt this liquid a little bit more so it'll be easier to pour into our butter so i'm going to leave that in there um for a few minutes i just got a comment and say be careful because i've been licking these and like the toothpick and stuff and it gets hitting me hard and i don't know i know i should stop but for the video you know i just want to taste like icings i think i got some oreo icing in it but be careful with how much you use okay this has been been in here for about like five minutes so it should be oh my god it's so hot okay so it should be good if you don't have it doesn't come in one of these bags which i know most don't just put it in a little plastic baggie to be honest it's probably fine to go in without anything but i mean why not use a bag isn't this packaging super cute i love these ones but i don't know i feel weird about using the ones online so i'm just going to open that because i gotta dry it off again there's our brand new cart and i'm gonna open um this part right here and then we're gonna pour all this liquid into our butter that's been melted so this should come out pretty easily because um it was in the hot water melting yeah you can see we got most of that out already okay and then whatever is left which there isn't much um i guess we'll just use a toothpick to get that out but you could use a blow dryer too to kind of push it down but yeah that came out really easy and it was only in the hot water for um like three or four minutes and you know i really don't like the taste of the back of all this like in the back of my throat like as i'm doing this because i've been eating like eating a little bits throughout and it just does not taste good so i really think it'd be nicer with the oreos and stuff so that you can kind of have something i don't know so it doesn't have to like line your mouth and throat it can just go right into your stomach and see now i have um it's all over this and i can't get that into the butter so i'm just gonna have to like suck this off of the toothpick how delicious okay this one doesn't taste as bad kind of tastes like lip gloss cool so now that we have um that poured in we're just gonna mix it into this butter and it's fruit punch flavored flavored i guess scented no i don't know i'm not sure but it doesn't really taste like fruit punch it does when you inhale it but the actual oil doesn't so that mixed in very very well and at this point you can just put it in the fridge and it's good to use in your recipes a nice easy infused butter i think i'm going to um scrape out the rest of my three cartridges and put them in here but because there's such little left in here it might be best to just um scrape it out with a toothpick and just kind of like eat it directly off not right now because honestly i've had too much and i can already tell it's like i'm going down a bad road with how much i've had and it hasn't even been that much but i still have to make dinner and stuff so i got to be capable of doing all that and i don't know about you guys but the one thing that i need to realize i shouldn't do when i'm high is cook because every time i cook when i'm high i mess something up and i'm not type person who usually messes things up when i cook but oh my goodness the nastiest the most gross dish i've ever made or the only like really bad dish the grossest dish i ever made was when i was high it was just i was making oh i don't want to tell you guys it was so gross but yeah so for these cards that i can't open i think i'm just going to straight up break them and do that to get the oil out um so yeah let's try that please tell me if there's a better way to open these because i feel like there must be something or i am just a major weakling and i can't open them i'm just gonna get this out of the way i'm gonna oh god how should i do this i think i'm just gonna like smack it with this oh god i'm so scared yeah okay what the heck there we go okay so i broke that there's the oil and then like i said we could put this without the sticker in um a pipe and use that because it'd be too hard to scrape this off i don't know how many times i'm going to tell you but it really does not taste good in in the mouth i need to go eat something like chewy to get get rid of the taste okay so these pieces i feel like need to go into the pipe so i'll put those there so we got all that there and then i'm gonna get my pipe this honestly feels like the most sketchy ghetto thing ever like literally smoking pieces of glass just be careful if you guys are gonna do this i'm assuming everybody is a grown up with a fully developed brain don't hurt yourself okay and then i'm literally going to smoke this these pieces of glass like a huge sketchy person but it works it really does work surprisingly now we got my glass that i'm about to hit okay let's do this yeah something's sparked so it's just like should i continue doing this you know what i don't suggest smoking the glass okay i did it if you choose to do it it wasn't me who's recommending it so just keep that in mind because that was a little bit sketchy and like what if you lit it up and then uh like glass sparked into your eye you know what i mean okay i'm so scared something's gonna hit my eyes let me just i'm still gonna do it even though i don't suggest it but just give me one second i'm back and i'm protected and i'm ready to try this again actually one second okay now that i got my personal protective equipment i think i'm ready to try this again i'm gonna get rid of that one with a little bit of something else on there i think it was like a sticker or something and let me just yeah there's still a little more there okay very fruit punch not really under the sea under the sea darling gets better down where it's wetter take it from me so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass but yeah i took the glass out not a good idea don't do it i mean you can but i do not suggest i'm good [Music] too um um yes thank you guys again very much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video and i apologize if it's all over the place because i'm a little high right now but when i wanted to show you guys in the last like 20 minutes i had let this butter sit out when i was [Music] smoking i don't know what i was doing and this is what it looks like just so you guys can kind of see it has stayed um emulsified uh you guys can't see that too well can you there you go so yeah that's how the butter looks a little a little weird-ish texture but yeah that is just regular unsalted butter one cart and some lecithin mixed it and i'm just gonna go store this in the fridge and then i'm gonna use it maybe to make um some toast tonight perhaps okay guys so to summarize a few different ways we put our distillate directly into our oreos just open them up rub some onto the frosting we melted some butter and poured in some warmed up distillate mixed it together with a little bit of lecithin i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own but if you find that you're mixing it together and it's not mixing just put it in the fridge go buy some lecithin and you can always add it later it's not going to hurt anything to add it um a little bit later instead of at the same time thank you guys so much for watching this video i apologize if i am being a little bit confused in any of the video because i've been needing the oil the whole time and it's just like it's hit me and i also was smoking my glass so that hit me real hard um as well speaking of which i do have the rest of mine that i'm going to hit right now but thank you guys very much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a comment give it a thumbs up and subscribe you", "ATvB4nB4ALs": "ah hi everybody sydney here welcome back to my channel today today i'm going to be going over the math on how to actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a little bit more if you like this video again please make sure to give it a thumbs up a like um if you didn't like this video whatever not sorry about it it is what it is you know i'm just trying to hear live life and make my freaking cannabis oily people so if you would like me to make something with this cannabis oil let me know in the comments below what you think i should make with it i tend to like to bake healthier things like paleo cakes and dairy free items and gluten free items that's kind of the stuff that i personally eat if you don't eat that stuff that's no big deal i literally do not care but also just let me know in the comments what you want me to make with this stuff because i'm planning on making oh actually i know exactly my sister's birthday is coming up if you're watching this in the very very very future it's already happened but maybe i'm gonna make her a birthday cake with it hope you guys enjoyed also levo thank you so much for providing me with this item if you guys haven't got yours all ready i'm obsessed with it i love using it it does make your place smell a little bit like cannabis but honestly in my opinion not as bad as like doing it in the stove top or in your own oven and it's freaking easy cleanup i just love how easy it is you can download an app you can control all the temperatures from your phone it's literally the best so if you're going to make the investment i highly suggest doing so if you want to buy one for yourself i'm going to link them down below so you can go purchase one i do not have a discount code just yet levo if you see this if you are watching i would love a discount code to give to my people so if that does happen and you're watching this again in the future i will update with the discount code below cool great y'all hope you all have a great day bye [Music] you", "3Um_y2mMYmM": "[Music]

we're gonna leave [ __ ] it excuse me I'll take one I was like you know what make it two he's like you want to try to two battles why where I work I'm the boss today brother boss was gone so literally all I do is sit at my desk that's pretty much all I [ __ ] do and I tell people what to do sometimes I was like [ __ ] I'll be highest fun doing this [ __ ] I was like we Gucci so he gives me these edibles not telling me that they are dispensary great he doesn't know what milligram they are he don't know nothing they're just two edibles so I said give me two I [ __ ] eat two he comes back he says you know that my father a piece writing I go what what the [ __ ] you gave me - 500 milligram brownies at work you know who you are mister mister you know I know you watch these videos and I'm trippin balls like trippin like shits moving like I can't [ __ ] straight like I'm tripping and here comes the big boss my boss's boss he comes in I'm trying to everything to avoid him he's like eyeballing me down trying to like run me down ask me questions I'm like around I have a broom and [ __ ] I'm like fake mopping faith sweep and I'm doing anything I can to stay out of his hair so we go yell at me well apparently they he makes it a point to take me in front of everybody and say how good of a job and how good of an example I am to these people that I work with hope I don't look everybody's just like smile and [ __ ] because I know they some of them know that I was full up like my eyes were dying like you can just tell on top of us off we got to tell you I used to work with my mom I was fine but I was the boss of my mom and this is the funniest my mom had no idea all these times I mean she probably had an idea but she never said nothing but yeah so miraculously I got out of that one and did not get in trouble those I probably should not took thousand milligrams of THC at work but [ __ ] it you do [ __ ] when you're dumb and young I mean I'm still dumb and young but I'm a little older but not much but that's the time I took edibles at work so hope you guys enjoyed the video remember always stay juicy peace", "7ByIlrav5o4": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and

It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Club M. \u266a\u266a I hear you've got a delivery\nservice or something like that. Yeah, we do\na monthly delivery service for a cannabis\nsubscription box.

So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000? First, we've got\n24 1/8th worth of flower that are delivered\nwith it. -So three zips a month. -Then cannabis cigar set. Got cannabis leaf, I've got\ntobacco, and I've got gold leaf. Three months aged,\npressed, and with rosin and sap\nin it, as well. Then we've got 24 vape pens,\n24 edibles, 24 topicals\nand tinctures and then each one will\ncome with a custom... -Gold tip. -24-karat gold. 240 diamonds in it. You got to let me\nkeep this, man. This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together.

review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "VqqYRm723XQ": "let's get Bert okay uh I think things are starting to get rolling here I think let's just make sure as we get stuff you know off the ground we'll just start talking about what's gonna happen here on this just a stream coming up all that fun stuff um let's see so this stream as we as advertised is going to be a good old fashioned challenge I know you guys love them this time we are going to be doing another 1,000 milligram challenge here live over a long long long stream I'm a little nervous because I'm already a little high and by a little high I mean quite high and I still have this to go so I'm feeling a little nervous Austin I'm just feeling a little bit more nervous than in general I don't know why I've got like stage fright or something here listen my voice dropping um what was it gonna look up oh yes let's see here yeah I feel like I've got a little stage fright or maybe it's just this maybe it is just this knowing I'm enough to do a thousand milligrams I I've never I don't know anything about dank wood pharmacy Pro dank as dean so I have no idea and you know what if this is as strong as advertised I've never reviewed it I don't I mean it seems hyper local it's addressed here in Long Beach you know so it's it's it's not a big product so it could be a total dud I guess you know it could be just in fact could be a complete that you know nothing can happen I could just be as high as I am right now I hope that's not the case I you know III hope to to be on the moon what do I think of little pomp what is uh what is little pomp oral Lancaster I'm not sure let me know and I'll tell you what I think of it so you know could be a total dud I'm guessing it's not I found syrups to be generally speaking pretty potent as long as this company is honest you know which is kind of um unfortunately not always the case in the edible industry that you know honesty isn't there first isn't the first value in when it comes to the marijuana edible industry unfortunately honesty is not it's not the first virtue I think getting that money is unfortunate so I will be doing all this over the course of you know a little bit there is four ounces in here which is a lot because I'm sure this is going to take growth this is going to taste gross I you know I'm gonna wishing in half and drink all this junk because it looks thick and nasty I'm sure it's gonna taste disgusting oh he's the new rapper that a 17 years old and he pops to experts add a sip saline every day and smokes ounces every day oh my god a little pump I'm gonna have to look up little pump as we speak because that sounds [ __ ] crazy look a little pump oh wow if you search little pee the first thing that comes up is a little pump oh he's got some sweet ass dreads I knew I liked his dreads I know he's got a point for rating on his fourth search result hotnewhiphop calm let's search little pump drugs open letter little pump xanax is not the wave finally someone calls out little pump okay let's check out this reddit thing mo run right here oh my god you're right yeah Jesus Christ oh my god what do I think of them I think the guy is probably headed for a complete and total he's headed he's barreling straight towards death would be my guess but you know more power to him his body he can do with you can do with it as he wishes but it seems to me he is on his way to nine anybody who does that many drugs in that short amount of time and at that young age well I guess your body is sort of equipped to handle it you know better than ever at that age but your brain is still very much plastic and malleable so it's hard to say or hard to think that doing all those drugs is going to have any you know beneficial things for his his brain uh because you know if he I only think about him as an artist I have no clue if he's talented or not but probably sabotaging his future artistic career right now by taking on these drugs but I'm not too horrible a breach again I'm you know that's totally fine with me whatever he wants to do again he's 17 god damn well Lancaster you open up a real hornet's nest here because I am not sure how to answer that question I guess my answer is okay so soon we will open this pro dank zine and see what's what's going on see if if we're gonna survive this big big old challenge here this thousand milligram challenge oh I tried my very first CBD product today I will be up in a review people have been asking me for a long time to do CBD CBD I always said like I just don't know if I am the guy for CBD it doesn't seem to be something that I would benefit from I'm not sure if my opinions have changed drastically but I found the experience illuminating I'm glad I did it and I probably will be reviewing some more CBD products in the future but but as for right now yeah I finally did it finally why I took my first CBD product and and thought it was and thought it was a worthwhile experience so you know ABI what it me um what else Oh exciting things have been happening here a tweets like super exciting things we will have oh let me go back up from exciting things Oh backing up backing up guys first off I am super high right now here is a preview of an upcoming review not just a preview a total spoiler but please promise me you'll still watch the review when it comes out later but this is a total spoiler zas oh my god guys zas is so great if you see xesspe at a dispensary near you i had the logo facing me if you see this ass at a dispensary near you grab it grab it grab it it is good stuff i this is not the first time I've taken it I now can officially say man really liked it I did it about two and a half hours ago and I'm still very high and that is why I am doing having to do this but let's go ahead and open up the package let's let's start it at least by you know opening the seal and seeing what's gonna happen cuz that's gonna you know once we once we break that seal everything will just get a little bit easier from there just a little bit you know because what we'll have started the process it won't be so intimidating won't have to fear from my life I won't have to fear that I'm gonna call an EMT and embarrass myself you know what I am though I am really afraid of how all this is gonna taste because there's all out of it and it's gonna taste gross guys it is not gonna taste good Shh scissors timing be right back scooting this way don't you be checking up my ass now boys and girls that's okay if you checked out my anus I forgive you now the goal is not to slice myself open with scissors many other in many ways in my like a three-year-old and in being imperiled by scissors is one of them goddamn guys how do you expect people to [ __ ] open pardon my french is it infused glycerin it does not say actually what it is here I will put it right up to the camera let you take a look it's mostly just really bad puns but that is all of the information that is provided oh I do see glycerin in the ingredients so maybe perhaps and I'm realizing that you probably can't read that through this shitty webcam and I have yet to invest in a DSLR got it open for a better webcam experience you know I've invested in a drone for whatever reason but not a DSLR and backwards priorities mistaking priorities here a tweets yeah well then the drone is more fun right so that's why that's why we've got the drum okay oh boy here we go 250 milligrams per ounce of the dank word pharmacy from four two zero one west cush Avenue in Long Beach California nine zero seven three one ha ha ha my prescribing physician was dr. bernard green thumb ha ha ha shake well before each use let's shake well hey the andis hands in pants the hands and pants I like I like your Jake is that like the ants and pants the ants and pants are you supposed to say it fast quickly like the hands and pants if so welcome the ends and pants I've shaken well opening sniffing oh my god it smells terrible let's get something with some caffeine ready to uh we'll call it a get some or we'll call it a chaser well welcome in be handsome pants glad I got your name correct all right so we've got our chaser ready not that you should ever have to have a chaser guys this smells like liquefied weed I mean it doesn't it's like they didn't flavor it at all it's just like it's it's just straight-up the smell of it's like you know if they had made a perfume out of weed it's it's terrible smelling and it cannot oh my god what am i bitching about let's just do a little bit of it all right I'm gonna aim to do about a quarter of it for now let's see what happens oh it's so thick it's Oh Dutch girl stroopwafels man uh I'm pretty sure I reviewed those exact product from Colorado in my vacation there they were they were really really good man and yes it is way better than pure syrup if those are the same thing that I had those work great I really really enjoyed this a hell of a lot are you I'm guessing then you're you're in Colorado the ends and pants if so man enjoy all right I have to do a little bit more of this I didn't make it to nearly a quarter nice dude enjoy I will not be I mean I'll be enjoying later hopefully but I will not be enjoying right now here we go little bit more down the hatch got to get to at least a quarter oh well I don't know if you can tell but I think I've gotten to about a quarter now Derby man yes there's noises are arousing I agree that's why I'm doing them that's why I'm making them oh I think you can't tell from the camera I'm watching myself oh I'm just trying to get the Derby man off right now you know it'll you know what I hope watch that taste them some kettle chips spicy castle flavor I think it might even be this is what we call buzz marketing kettle brand crinkle cut potato chips spicy queso they're delicious they make your weed not taste as shitty that's free nice way for you cuddle cut do with that what you will you can die in peace now well I hope you don't die anytime soon Derby man even if you are sexually satisfied amen once once once you get one end you dude you just can't stop oh [ __ ] this one looks amazing okay I'm just gonna do this one just right now and I'm done mmm all right this is really rude you can tell them hi already because I'm being so goddamn rude whew okay um this syrup is definitely not good tasting it's actually not as bad tasting as I would have guessed from how it smelled huh but it is very hard to get through I mean it it is it's like drinking pancake syrup and it's that sort of consistency so it's trying to get it down it's just right if you're not a fool or if you're not doing like a stupid YouTube challenge my suggestion would be to mix it with something and slowly you know mix a little bit drink a little bit it's a thousand milligrams you don't need to do it this [ __ ] quickly unless you're a stupid fool like I am and a stupid fool I am indeed um and jeez Louise am I already high as she it-- Oh guys I want to just go over a couple of things with you that I went over armaros most recent vlog and by most recent I mean only vlog I got my dog down here Benny and she's being a [ __ ] she's a female dog it wasn't actually singing and salting or degrading the term turning those because they don't support that so we're gonna have some format changes boom guys you might have already seen some of our cool new logos and stuff where our okay new logo whoever you are on Fiverr that designed this logo for an amount of money that I'm not happy to have spent on it you did an okay job I'm not super pleased with it but I'm not gonna call you out by name so you're welcome it's not bad it's not bad it's not ROI all right really exactly what I envisioned but well we'll get there at some point I'm bitching we've got some other cool things coming up there will be some format changes within the reviews and themselves the reviews will largely stay the same you know the two hours the patented wheats two hours blabbity blabbity bloobity blah blah bluh all that good stuff um but what have some new bumpers will have some new logos will have some new images new graphics GRA FF IX graphics all that cool [ __ ] it's all coming up on wheats it's all coming up soon um next thing you might noticed if you looked at our freaking banner ad our super-sweet banner ad that I designed myself because they design one with squash and pumpkins or whatever and I know that's redundant because a pumpkin is a squash but I don't know what pumpkins are hey welcome mr. Shaab Schwab shop shop if I got Shaab Krait correct Schwab shop showed Brendan hey Brendan welcome we'll just go with Brendan howdy doody I'm glad you made it buddy we're just talking about some of the stuff briefly uh-oh we've already gotten about a third of the way or recorded the way through the bottle tasted really gross in case you're just now tuning in tasted super super gross didn't like it also already incredibly high started off very high feeling myself already getting higher and getting terrified because I realized that I have a lot left to do and we've barely even begun so great this is gonna be fun this is gonna be fun for everyone okay so we're going to a structured release schedule guys isn't that cool instead of just like reviews Oh first back up rewind rewind rewind we have rewound let's rewind here first I want to apologize Thank You Brandon I appreciate the encouragement I appreciate the enthusiasm we're rewinding for a second because I want to explain to you guys I want to apologize for all those notifications that you probably been getting this week for all those videos dropping like you know 10 11 videos dropping over this week or whatever and usually like a bunch dropping in a row that's because I'm trying I was clearing out some of the way little backlog and I just wanted to get it out there before we went on the structured release schedule which is coming up so that's why all those videos came out so quickly so back to forth so if you were if your phone was blowing out from notifications or whatever my apologies that battle be over with starting now because starting Wednesday of this week I think is when our structured a release schedule begins so we're gonna have videos coming out at 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday four days a week four videos a week every day what does every day mean I mean four days a week at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time so you guys can sort of expect him at that time they're not just dropping at like 10:00 a.m. or 1:00 p.m. you know maybe five days in a row and then three days off or whatever no they're just gonna be coming out scheduled now weirdly in concert with this new schedule of structured releases I will actually not be taking any THC what's the best dispensary for your buck and law reach the ends and pants the ants and pants there are actually very few dispensaries in Long Beach that's a great question you asked Long Beach just recently started allowing recreational or and not recreational no not I mean medicinal because there's no recreational anywhere until 2018 I believe California is confusing so within Long Beach I don't actually pick up anything from here there are a couple of like illegal dispensaries that I've been to a couple times but you normally pay a premium for the people being willing to have their shop be closed down which you'd be surprised the number of people that are willing to just you know I would spend the expense to open a dispensary that's definitely going to be shut down but you know whatever it's not my money so I go Orange County which I am Orange County adjacent I live all right first off Long Beach is right on the border of Orange County and I live very close to that birder so I just go into Orange County and then there I like to go to cool calm collective in Huntington Beach and then I like the best buck I've ever seen they have moved and I haven't been in a while they are now in Santa Ana they used to be and yes it is still bad in Southern California compared to Northern California for short Northern California is orders of magnitude better for we than Southern California in terms of attitudes towards you know just communities being accepting towards it legal legalities you know municipalities not trying to ban it and just the density of shops there's so many more shops in Northern California than there are in Southern California okay okay yeah Riverside I have not actually been to Riverside but I have seen the weed maps and it's a it looks like the desert that it is located in a total weed desert there um so yes Oh what was he talking about oh yes moving to release schedule guys I am so sorry imma have to turn on the AC it's gonna get a little out for a bit that but well we'll make it work we'll make it work I'm just gonna turn it on for just a second and get it cool in here and then we'll turn right back off okay yes so in concert weirdly with this this new release schedule I will be on a month-long tolerance break starting Monday September 11th going on big tolerance break I'll probably do one more wheat slide between now and then maybe that Sunday I don't know well I'll be sure to let people know through Facebook and Twitter Facebook and Twitter I'll let people know as soon as I know when and if we'll have a final weed slide before the tolerance break but guys just because I'm going on a big ol tea break does not mean that the reviews will stop I will still have reviews coming out the four times a week at least for the next like Kappa sorry everyone for that your piercing scream but when Kappas cap is here man you've got to make some noise you got to make some noise for Kappa welcome sir hey man so glad you could make it we're just talking about the new schedule and talking about the tolerance break we are or we I will be tolerance breaking for a whole month which is the longest I have gone without smoking weed since I have oh sweet do you know exactly when Kappa because if you're coming sometime in the next month I am be willing to you know take a break from this tolerance break you know just to say had my buddy Kappa but neither here nor there for now so yes taking a month-long tolerance break which will be the longest I've gone without smoking weed since I started smoking weed about five years ago now something like that I think so that's a long time not necessarily looking forward to it variety of reasons I'm doing it but it's gonna happen okay cool cool cool cool cool I'll probably be done with my tolerance break by then Oh oh my god see Dobie man you're on the worst of all situations the tolerant the unforced tolerance or the first tolerance break the tolerance break where somebody we're not one where you would want to take it but one because your hookup is not available I've had those before whoo yes the answer pants you are very correct even even a 48-hour tolerance break can do a lot to reset one's you know ability to be a nerd to cannabis but but like a 2-week if you can go on a two-week tolerance break I mean which I just did recently about a month ago oh my god um yes Kappa do it ah you're gonna have to pick up a ton of Kanako's while you're there yeah you have to experience the best of the best no from Kappa from what I have experienced I have never seen a dispensary that has had anything like a purchasing limit I mean I've seen them sell up to quarter pounds before that's the most I've ever seen anybody sell its quitter pounds but I don't know if that's necessarily a hard cap would be a quarter pound and if it is you could always this then go to another dispensary and get another quarter pound in Kappa I'm sure you are not even sure you already know this you're sure I don't need to tell you this but be sure that you visit weed Maps while you are here so that you can you know be able to find the yes so so you can find the best deals because I mean things are in terms of prices kappa i've noticed we actually recently were in the past like three months prices on things are really starting to hit an equilibrium in the market where edibles used to have crazy variance in pricing i've noticed but we're now slowly slowly slowly hitting an equilibrium in terms of pricing at dispensaries but we'd maps is still an indispensable tool it will definitely help you still find the best deals because there are great deals to be had as long as you're willing to look I do not kappa because I the most I've ever purchased at one time in terms of flower is this single ounce never done more than that and I've only ever bought an ounce twice before so I've never looked for the best wholesale prices or you know for the best absolute bang for your buck if you're buying you know again and wholesale or and bulk or whatever but I will keep an eye out for you I I know you're coming sometime in the next you know a month or a few weeks so I will keep an eye out for your consider I'd like to visit a bunch of dispensaries I will look at their prices I will even ask him if they sell wholesale and I will report back to you bud if I find anything out there great deals for you so Renan 21 tolerant day tolerance break it was great yes tolerance breaks are great but I've noticed that too your tolerance builds back up again quickly you do have like a you're sort of you have like a two-week period or at least I did where my tolerance was lowered but it did sort of hit its you know normal and sort of normalized again after about two weeks or so so it's not like a complete reset a tolerance break it just gives you like a you know a couple of weeks it that's that's assuming getting you you smoke or imbibe at the same level of THC you are doing before if you're doing a reduced amount you know weed after your tolerance break then you're you know tolerance should be sufficiently reduced for quite a bit longer but neither here nor there that's just my experience as well your mileage may vary oh okay delivery services I rarely use delivery services anymore I used them a lot when I first started because I don't use them as much because you get letter you rarely get as good of deals dirty man I do intend to finish this whole bottle before the stream ends I'm planning on streaming for a while which is why I've not yet had any more to drink but my goal is to finish this bottle before the stream ends so so I can't promise that I will you know be conscious throughout it all but I will be drinking a little bit more soon Oh Susie yes but that was my cases well Brynn and I my tolerance got back up to where it was after about two weeks but I was eating edibles at the same rate I it was before yes the California market is super super weird the ants and pants the thing I hate the most is I actually you know and I'm sorry libertarians out there I wish there was more regulation in the market here I wish I wish there was somebody out there you had to get all edibles lab tested for both pesticides and for potency because you get ripped off so often guys spoiler alert for what what is coming we're gonna have reviews for individual companies and some are going to be total complete excoriation 'he's not to name any names LOL edible food of showers um Wow Wow that is those are some pretty good deals but that's the best close to the best price of an ounce i've ever seen and the cheapest I've ever seen a 250 milligram Korova was probably $13 so I think that's the cheapest I've seen Wow oh okay I have heard about Nevada hey welcome welcome welcome welcome glad you made it I knew you were excited for the for the stream so I'm glad you could you could tune in where just to give you a heads up we're about a quarter of the way through the bottle right now we'll be doing a little bit more soon I am already high as f and got a lot left to do so I'm gonna oh sorry for my gross thumb guys look how gross that is ooh that is from the result of a GoPro mount a good point mount that got stuck and I was like trying to get the little clamp clip to come through and it finally came through and then my finger shoved in it yes I've seen those I've seen those there are a lot of people that will Skype or FaceTime with doctors now it's just because California I mean it's a joke it's a total joke in California it's a big laughing joke that everybody is going through for the next couple of months until tonight 2018 when the joke is over with yes hi already and the reason I am hi already is that I actually did a review right before this I did a review before the stream started that ended the review ended like half an hour before the stream started so I was already very high and then I did the force first quarter of the syrup which is starting to hit so now I'm already into crazy high territory and we have a lot left to do so it's gonna be fun for everyone I am sure speaking of which here we go oh so isn't the same pesticides that we'd be drinking and our wine they're using and Ben asks you bring up a good point I am I'm not the best person in the world to be concerned about pesticides have talked about being concerned in pesticides I worked up for about two years in an entomology lab where we studied fire ants and bedbugs and we played with all kinds of harsh and crazy pesticides so I'm kind of like a nerd to the scariness of pesticides and I know I'm probably gonna get cancer at some point anyways from my exposure to pesticides so I'm not super super worried about it and Kappa I hope you can find it too buddy I would check man I don't know anybody out here sort of tied in to that world of the market those sort of wholesale side to help with either I only smoke roundup Monsanto for me baby yes I will be enjoying tripping I am already getting close to trippy trippy trip been um Oh guys what um what companies do you want me to review by the way so we're going to be doing company specific reviews which are a Shrek of a lot of work eh how long have I lived in Long Beach I have a little bit in Long Beach for one year and eight months now and loved it the entire time loved it loved it loved it a Long Beach has kind of a reputation as being I don't know less-than-stellar we live in we're very fortunate to live in a very nice part in Long Beach we live in a very nice mmm area in Long Beach we but we live in a the building that brings everybody's property values down we wear the building that everybody hates but we're fortunate live in a really nice area love Long Beach totally well of the city love the vibe of the place don't get its reputation it just not great for wheat unfortunately right now yes doing a tolerance break soon why is that again have quite a few things going on IRL huge work projects coming up that I just need oh yes you do volcanoes are amazing it is it is a big expense you know the volcano but oh sure I'll get back to that in just a second why is my tolerance break happening yes have a quite a big few big work projects coming up and have some weeks projects also that I need to focus on and so because of that I will be doing this big tolerance break I don't need it to be a whole month I wait I needed to be like a couple of weeks but I decided to go for the whole month just because it could be good to take a huge month off and just you know sort of start from square one again so that's why it's happening volcanoes are awesome kappa if you've got the five hundred dollars to spend i know it's a lot to swallow but it is a hell of a way to it's my second-favorite way of doing weed behind edibles is volcano bags for sure moreso than just regular smoking more than you know more than a pipe more than a water pipe I've never actually tried brass knuckles to be honest I know they have a great reputation I don't do a whole lot of baked pens [Music] you pet my dog oh I'm gonna do it so yeah I don't review some wanna gummies I would like to I've had people ask me to review some wanna gummies but I have not seen it any actually in any of the dispensaries I wonder if they're just not sort of in Orange County or in Los Angeles County but I will review them as soon as I've seen them because I had a lot of people do them I've never heard of Stillwater teas but if I do find Stillwater artis I will review them because I am very I'm always interested in the beverages I always like reviewing the beverages so if I find the Stillwater cheese I will definitely review those as well ooh they also tested positive for pesticides and Capra what were you asking if if what tastes good oh brass knuckles so yes and I've got two dog O's in here actually Michael II and both of them need pets and they're both scratching leaving to play timesplitters and get baked with a buddy all right man I will oh it does it does kappa yes it tastes great dude the the back oh sorry I keep me and my camera assembly told me before that he was making a motion sick yes that that's new and it did look like she was being left out she's a she's a needy needy dog and Brendon real quick if you haven't left yet are you playing like timesplitters on the ps2 timesplitters like that's crazy that game was amazing back in the day by TimeSplitters - so good timesplitters 3 did it ever get made I can't remember but I'm a big fan of the timesplitters go play enjoy all right guys it's may be time for a little bit more of the bottle let's see what's gonna happen here yeah yeah yeah yeah oh sweet dude playing some time splitters on the Gamecube how classic how very 2002-2003 of you have fun man I I still have that wackadoodle but uh I got you I got you Beeston timesplitters was an awesome game times learners to also was an awesome game time slitters to to was amazing okay here we go a little bit more syrup already crazy high not looking forward to this tastes really gross here we go Oh Michael that's so cool buddy I'm glad I didn't know you were the guy from reddit welcome man I'm so glad I'm so glad you made it to the stream and I'm glad you recommended it because somebody else I appreciate it and I'm sorry for those gross noises I was making I know it was really getting off Derby man earlier so I was giving a little bit extra a little acting for him but how much do I like reddit wheats well I've been taste wheaty or just cough syrup II it tastes like both unfortunately it has the UM like the sort of alcohol II burning taste of a cough syrup and then the bed her ass Arabic you know unmistakable cannabis taste as well so the worst of both worlds is the way I'd like to describe it I need a chip I need a chip how do I deal with the parent that crazy paranoia of edibles I do get there only only after being crazy crazy crazy high so I really get that high anymore but if I do I I try to just go to sleep the last time that that happened was probably the last time I did one of these challenges um the Korova black bar after about three and a half hours I got so high I was crazy high I needed I had to like go lie down and I wasn't I wasn't explaining how paranoid I was in the street but I was I was getting quite paranoid and ultimately just was like okay gotta go chill because this is this this is too much but to answer a edison's question how much I like reddit it's ok um I I don't I'm not a great self advertiser I don't like advertising myself I don't like having to go out there and sell myself I hate doing social media I've recently I recently just started really pushing Facebook and Twitter following me on Facebook and Twitter right there follow us on Facebook and Twitter just recently and read it's a little bit it feels a little less shameless we know if there's a little bit I don't know it feels shameless and gross all around but but it's it's a necessary part of the business but I do like reddit it's a quick community for sure I like going there I don't like having to advertise on reddit but I like the community and I like reading reddit but you know it's a it's a part of part of the game I guess oh and your tolerance is only around 90 milligrams that's pretty nice I wish mine were that low oh wow the answer depends less than 10 milligrams if only I will be doing 100 times that today oh my god it's Church those trips so good I do dab often I I don't have as much as I hate but I have I don't actually have a dab rig I have a nectar collector which I like I like using the nectar collector a lot it's a lot I find a lot less messy than a traditional gab rig and I'm kind of scared of torches I mean you stop to have a torch for a nectar collector but I feel like it's less cumbersome using the nectar collector method and I feel like I'm less likely to burn the house down Oh as an email setup is that one of the setups that are constantly running like the ones that you basically plug into the wall that's always on and you just put your nail on there and it's good to go what would I say is my most ideal dose milligram wise well it depends on the product I would say a slightly less than one hole 250 milligrams Kanaka bar or kirova cookie or something oh sweet dude yes I think I know what those are I've seen there some places out here now a kapa that will basically let you do dabs in in the in the store at the dispensary I've seen three different dispensaries have dab breaks it up and they all have email setups it's pretty cool I've done some dabs off of those although I think that that is probably not legal but I've done some dabs from those and those setups are super super cool and oh my god guys I am already I'm already getting crazy I don't see how much we have left we've got about Oh what would you say a little less than half to go I think oh no it's a little more than half because we're at know a little less than half a little less than half okay good good when I dab I sweat so hard and coughs a bad I can't do it I mean when I do it's like super high yes I used to be really bad about the coughing with dabs I've gotten better about finding like the perfect sort of size for my lungs but but yeah I still I still occasionally get way to cough way too much to take away too much and cough like the next 15 minutes and start sweating and I start watering the whole the whole deal but but but I've gotten better about figuring out exactly where my sort of sweet spot is again my favorite way of smoking or you know in not smoking it's vaping is it's volcano volcano if you want to pay me to say that you can I love the volcano it's a great product guys also really sad if you look next to my volcano up on top of the gumball machine my pineapple just ran out of batteries you were not afraid of taking a thousand milligrams this challenge oh I was terrified I am terrified at the very beginning of this stream I was here being like guys I don't know if I can do this I think I'm gonna pass out I don't know if I've got what it takes so in almost a half gram death that's pretty big that's pretty big it's not the biggest but but no no no that's smooch yeah a half 0.3 gram dab is huge that's giant because you can buy I'm thinking in terms of the size of flour yeah in terms of dabs that's that's outrageously big good luck man I'm I'm glad you I'm glad you made it through because I think that's a lot my math is my mathematical skills are beginning to beginning to decline in here unfortunately um my god I'm gonna need this caffeine this is wild um to sort of explain what's going on I'm I'm at the point where I'm having some levels of visual not necessary hallucinations but things are at the edges I'm not sure actually I'm not sure what the most I would have done it ones probably somewhere in the range of what Kappa has done I'd say less than that I don't think I've ever come close to doing a half gram I would so probably 0.2 1.15 something like that would be the biggest but I don't know for sure what would I like to see legalized recreational let's get some let's get somewhere on the East Coast a good bastion a good a good spot on the East Coast to legalize recreational let's do something like North Carolina they have the Research Triangle there so they have like a sort of liberal smart kind of you know more hippyish base there lots of good choice for months but we're not small and Vermont already has a reputation for being crazy you know super liberal and everything in Vermont's gonna if it doesn't already I would like to see yeah I'm gonna go with North Carolina it does North Carolina has a crazy unfortunate super conservative well they have the Democrat governor now they have a liberal governor so that's helpful this is just wishful thinking because I think North Carolina would be like a domino state and if they got it things like Georgia Tennessee might start to consider it so I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with my rejoins there and go North Carolina that's a final answer Alex no it not Alex Reva Regis what state will legalize recreational ass Mississippi Mississippi is my answer wait Massachusetts in Maine is ME Maine I can't remember what is Emmie state emmys state it is me for me I've got an awesome third-grade education I've got a great third-grade education guys speaking of New York and weed how many of you have watched the incredible both web show an HBO show are now HBO show high maintenance if you have not seen high maintenance shame on you all of you first of all high maintenance is so [ __ ] good it's unbelievable I mean it's crazy [ __ ] and sanely good and you need to be watching it and it's all about people in New York who you know pot is somehow involved in their life but it's not about pot necessarily it's it's it's wonderful it's heartfelt you should all be watching it I recommend it heartily and in fact when we're done watching this stream and go to HBO now or HBO GO or god forbid the regular ass TV and watch high maintenance it's incredible eye maintenance I totally suggest it and you don't have HBO in any capacity watch the webseries because I think it's free it's on Vimeo I believe high maintenance search for it you will not be sad you did that is a week's money back guarantee nice dude kappa do you have like a nice garage or something that you've got all your toys in sounds like you've got a lot of fun toys I used to I used to have space for big toys but living in Southern California you you get used to not having Jesus amen oh oh I didn't know you were in NYC that's awesome so you definitely need to be watching high maintenance because it takes place in New York City so great so great I need it I need to visit that's a lot that's more than an ounce right 24 know what is an ounce it's uh oh sweet Kappa that's awesome kappa that's right yes I think 14 grams is half an ounce um Kappa what is your face no that's a weird question but I have to ask I've never known what Oh Dobie men you can email it to me email it to me a tweets reviews at gmail.com oh it's from twitch okay okay oh thank you everyone thank you wow I am really out of the loop there's like boom everyone was like twitch twitch twitch twitch twitch you can see I don't play or watch too much twitch unfortunately I do love me some minigames though and guys if I were not doing the stream right now I would be playing a video game for sure I would be playing the fart out of I mean I would be playing the ever [ __ ] fart out of Mario Plus Rabbids Mario Plus Rabbids Kingdom battle holy Sh art is that game amazing we do have to play pub G soon kappa o deadly man make me something i need to check this out let's see under link nice w-wait what is dirty man what is that the second diagonal in the W we have the THC drink we have the candy bar the two different candy bars but I'm not sure what the vaguely and I do not mean to denigrate your artwork at all because it is beautiful but what is the vaguely poop-shaped thing in the the second piece of your w and a might have already answered it oh it's an UGG it's an UGG it's nug that's beautiful work for mspaint view that is wonderful work for mspaint let me see if I can share it with the with the the the the Twitter the Twitter guys oh my god hold on let me see if I can share this link let me go back to my mail with the chat here copy link I don't know if being what do you guys think of this all right so that's that's what that's the amazing image derby man just made for me and again I'm sorry I did not mean for mspaint it's beautiful I did not mean to say that you're nug looked like a poop in any way shape or form but but I really appreciate it and I will consider it it's not it's a it's actually you know it's it's um it's it's maybe better than the current W I have up there it's certainly more representative than pineapples now that my pineapple lamp is busted and Michael yeah I am so sorry you're finding this difficult to masturbate to let's see if I can find something maybe if I do one of these derpy turd oh what a good pun pun what a good pun there's something I can't I'm too high to come with puns now I usually love puns puns are normally my bread and butter but I am too high to be coming up high and Edison asked it do I think I can function very well while high the answer to that question is you tell me because I am super high and am i functioning I'm not sure I'm definitely something yes thank you for sharing did the man if anybody else wants to share some artwork you can send it right to me and I will definitely share it with somebody with everybody else let me see if I can make you guys managed moderators these users can remove comments which can appear by blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah how do I make you guys I should make a discord chat channel I will do that I will work on that that is a let's add it to the list guys here we go to do's and then I'll tell you all about my cool notebook isn't this gonna be fun here we go making it right here make oh Jesus [ __ ] make a discord channel can I describe how high I am right now the edges of my vision are starting to blur a little bit like I can feel my peripheral vision starting to close in a little bit I am superstone I wouldn't say visually hallucinating that is not the way that I am would describe it but it's not far off like I keep seeing things to the sides I feel like I'm sort of in the living kind of two seconds in the past right now like everything I'm saying is something that I'm now experiencing in the past like I haven't yet formulated what I've said and I now that I I'm only now understanding it when I'm hearing it like oh [ __ ] I can't believe I just said that like how cool is it what I just said headache no headache no headache whatsoever feel physically fine Rocka says you should eat two handfuls of deep carved weed with no flavoring or beverage from an entire stick of butter for fat oh that would be disgusting but I should that sounds like an experiment probably not gonna do it I am super soon so yes it's like everything I'm experiencing everything slightly in the past and I'm not even saying what I'm saying and I'm only realizing what I'm saying after it is escaped my mouth and then it's like man I can't believe I just said that how cool is that so I hope that sums up for you how high I am I'm glad my dogs are here they're ignoring me they're sleeping oh nice half of Korova three-dose pretty good that's how the pilgrims got high so what was I saying what was I talking about somebody's got to remind me oh it doesn't matter what I was talking about cuz I'm gonna be talking about something different right now I'm gonna be talking about my look guys this notebook is so cool I just wrote this in so look at all these notes I have in here these are scripts for upcoming yes I do I make fire crackers Ben s nice kappa nice diesel OG crumble is super nice a lot of those are scripts for upcoming weeks things but the cool thing about this notebook the thing that i was like oh i have to share something with you is you can use these FriXion pens the erasable pens I mean that's fun in any notebook you can use the erasable pens the cool thing about this notebook is it's all super erasable because you can microwave it erase everything in here if you use those goddamn FriXion pens you put a little cup of water on that little a little circle there and a little cup of water flip it over put a little cup of water here for 30 seconds each time and erases all the ink and you can use it again like new and if you look at the very bottom in these little tiny symbols I don't know how well they're showing up but you can see those little symbols you just check through it you just X through it and then when you you can take a picture on this notebook with that little dotted paper lines because you can see it's got these little like graph paper dots it helps to scan you see you scan it it's wave wave it's awesome and you scan it and then it goes directly like you determine what folder you want to send it to so I say like oh this symbol means email it goes directly to your email this symbol means iCloud notebook it goes directly to your iCloud notebook super cool super dope I like writing stuff in notebooks physically still so I it's super super help for me just guy who maintains skunk number one since he's taken 45 hundred milligrams of THC and it's day before holy [ __ ] oh my god how would you the most I would have done is probably about 1200 no less than that they've done it a thousand milligrams well uh today today I will have done 12:40 I will have done 12:40 at the end of today because I will have done this oh [ __ ] unless I'm on the side of drink guys I'm gonna need more drink okay let's uh skype man Sam I like the name I like his name skunk man 10 what a dope ass name let's check some stats before we drinks more liquid okay guys what we are now one hour and five minutes into the stream I've done a little bit over a half of the SERP sizzurp and I listened to almost exclusive oh oh that would be um Oh derby men sent us a new link ooh a lot better a lot better that definitely looks more Nuggets here I'll send it I'll share it with everybody again I like it a bit I like it I like it a lot here is raucous listens to bluegrass indie kappa what kind of indie music do you listen to I listen to pretty much exclusively indie stuff my favorite band of all time don't laugh would be the shins my second favorite band of all time would be the National slash Jason is Bowl bluegrass I like the I like bluegrass I like Steep Canyon Rangers a whole lot that they're great I don't listen to enough bluegrass traditionally but I do like it I love folk recently I've been listening to a sort of non-stop Waxahachie watt walks are hot I had no idea how to say her name so so so good but yeah I listened to a bunch of stupid [ __ ] I guess you would call it but I love stupid [ __ ] I don't have Spotify believe in rot I use Apple music because I'm a sucker I'm a dweeb so yeah I use Apple music that is I thought I thought is nug was beautiful too man I thought it was super super beautiful I don't think I can make any of you guys like cool people until I get super chat which I don't get until I have a thousand subscribers so we need to get a thousand subscribers so I can get super chat so I can make everyone here a moderator so you can all post your own links to chat and not get flagged as spam now wouldn't that be great wouldn't that be I deal okay um geez Louise I just cannot believe I have to do another half of this let's see what else would I would I say I'm experiencing Oh guys guys did I I might have mentioned this in the beginning of this stream this is a spoiler so you still have to watch this review coming up probably not for about like three four or five six weeks something like that but you got to watch still oh no here comes a burp oh god I'm sorry ah I'm gonna fart I'm really high um I love Rick and Morty I have not seen episode six just yet I am very much looking forward to seeing it who doesn't love Rick and Morty it's almost as good as community that's all I got to say about that guys I didn't have a very first CD oh my god ruckus that is amazing what if our mouths farted in our butts burped life would be incredible if that were the case could you nuts imagine walking around and instead of just been like you know going so you would oh my god life would be so funny if I ever don't think farts are funny I want somebody to just end me you know because farts which should always be should and always will be incredibly funny and if I ever don't find a fart funny then I then there's something I've gone a Benilde III also houston pour one out for for Houston and in the spokes they're affected by hurricane Harvey that's really terrible actually not to yes I am high as hell I am crazy hi guys as I was saying before if I weren't doing this week's live right now I would be playing Mario Plus Rabbids on the switch do you any of you guys have a switch man I am so so happy with that console yeah about five hundred and fifty milligrams are I've imported anything raucous good point maybe too soon but damn good point out I have really brought the tone down here is there a point where you can't get any higher with edibles like you can by smoking it I don't I've gotten to the point where I green out once so I mean you will eventually pass out Michael ye I've only ever done it once like truly passed out that was the very first time I ever made firecrackers I told the story several times before very briefly I did firecrackers make firecrackers for the very first time from a BB emitted about half an hour I went to go pick up some food was waiting in line hit me like a goddamn sledgehammer right between the eyes could barely make it home didn't even manage to put the food in the refrigerator before passing out on the couch welcome to like four to six hours later still high as [ __ ] do I ever think I will be eventually become successful I don't know I'm not doing it to be successful I don't really care if I ever become super successful oh I would appreciate that yeah well I mean true the reason I'm doing it honestly was I was tired of getting ripped off with edibles I'm just so so tired of because I like trying different things I always like experimenting with different levels trying different things finding cool new interesting products so that was part of it but then I realized I was getting ripped off all the time experimenting on new things and I was just you know letting these companies get away with it and so I thought man instead of just letting other people get ripped off maybe I should make do something about it and just like make reviews on YouTube sharing with people letting them know which ones are actually worth your money because these things are expensive these things are very expensive you it totally sucks to spend 20 bucks on something to think you're gonna have a great fun night and then you know you eat it in two hours later you don't feel anything so that's why I'm doing it the only reason I would ever hope for it to get big would be that you know it saves more people more money more people don't get ripped off by the shadiest [ __ ] companies out there but I'm not like dying for it to get huge but the more exposure the better because the more exposure it gets the more likely people are to not get ripped off by shitty companies what what is my favorite firecracker recipe ruckus my favorite firecracker recipe was was precisely this I don't know how much avb was in it a [ __ ] ton um probably something like five grams actually in this one firecracker but it was graham cracker natural all-natural peanut butter five grams of a BB a smidge of coconut oil just a very small smidge of coconut oil nutella some more the other half of the a BB excuse me the other half of a VP then the Nutella then another graham cracker in the oven excuse me wrapped tightly in aluminum foil in the oven at for 300 at 320 degrees for 22 minutes that's my favorite recipe does mean great all the time yes I'm so glad I stopped everybody from buying lol edibles and and that's I'm going to be doing a review of them of them explicitly in the future because I feel like they deserve a target they deserve people knowing explicitly not to be purchasing from them because they're as we get in terms of first name wheats has no first name wheats is an institution I don't actually use your first name we don't use any names here on weeds the reason being is in the future we might have more wheats hosts I might even pass the reins on to other people at some point and everybody will only ever be on this channel as wheats or wheats cohost number X there will never be like a person on here and with with being named because wheats is an institution as we like to say and we'd like to say that as of this moment so I hope that oh thanks Jeremy man that came direct from China I think we found it on like I keep me in the goddamn sorry I keep don't mind to see there's some people like goddamn that came directly from China space curtain took about two weeks to get here only cost like twelve dollars and like Alibaba or something it smelled like [ __ ] for two weeks because of whatever chemicals they used to diet but now it's totally cool now it's this cool space curtain on the back and now we also have this dry-erase thing and this pillow curtain and all those pineapples well we're really uh Kappa oh I'm not going anywhere Kappa I'm not going anywhere trust me that's just theoretical theoretical in the future type stuff but way way way way way way way off in the future but ruckus well where are you where you located we'd love to have some more co-hosts if you're if you're anywhere near the area or if you want to produce some independent content just email me a tweets reviews at gmail.com and we can talk we can maybe set something up and I will stop trying to nee my desk so that I don't shake the camera I know isn't that weird Cleveland Oh Cleveland what kind of edible presents you get out there in Cleveland ruckus do you do import stuff from other states or do you make homemade stuff what do you do I'm not sure how do you how do you survive what do you do for your edibles out there in Cleveland ruckus I'm genuinely curious because I know some people some people in this very stream in fact who do send importation of their edibles which I find so fascinating and so cool and I just genuinely curious oh sweet your medical system starts this time next year that is really cool hopefully they're going to be very very generous with who they allow in their their legal system okay I think it's time for Derby man let's talk again guys if you have recommendations if you have anything you want to add to the show or talk to you about the show I'd love to hear from you I'd love to talk with you email me weeds reviews wheats reviews at gmail.com and we'll talk in the future I promise you I know I need to try to do some baking I'm terrible terrible at it I also have a very bad kitchen for it I don't have a good kitchen for like recording to set up stuff but I have thought about in the past trying to find I know some people who are good at cooking and oh that's really cool I didn't know that ruckus that's really cool kappa of course of course we can make all of these things happen again we will will well we'll use these things just review me email me weeks reviews at gmail.com we'll make some wool we'll figure out some ways to collaborate make wheats a bigger better experience for everyone I think now is have I ever made my own edibles before firecrackers I have tried to make some edible as other than firecrackers but have ended only in total and complete failure so the answer is no it's hard to say about bud reviews or even the concentrate reviews maybe we do a wheat spin off because wheats the term the name wheats is we eat like we'd eat you know like one absolute time I no no no no no never at just like all at one time 500 milligrams the most of your done in just like one you know one go a ruckus nice it's the most okay it's taken me two hours before although I will done this probably yeah in about two hours guys I have to go grab something to drink while to help me wash this down so I will be right back I've never smoked out of a wood pipe derby man actually so I guess I gotta say glass but only because I think it was it's the only thing I've ever experienced okay guys I'll be right back play the trip any music to you to yourselves be right back I have returned with an adorable little baby for the plumber a little a little my dogs are opening the door yes guys it's an Arizona tea but baby-sized okay.what back in the chat what it's my opinion so far on the product do I think it is as strong as the black box in Korova no hell no it is actually not as strong as I thought it would be granted I'm only about I've had only half of it so far we're a little bit more than half and it has only been it's been less than 90 minutes and I've only had you know I haven't had all half I haven't had the half of it that entire 90 minutes either it's still not as strong as I the crib a black bar but it's definitely you know there's there's it's it's not lacking in potency it's just not nearly as strong as the as the black bar I would say at this point Oh literates and pants take care bud thanks so much for watching man I appreciate it okay guys let's do a little bit more it is time to drink a little bit more of this scissor here not looking forward to it at all on the count of three three two one whoo the answer is how much however much I could get through which is quite a lot there's very little left we're almost done I'm almost done I will finish it very soon ruckus next time nice to get through let's let this little next a little bit hit us and then we will finish the bottle and then we'll stick around for a little bit and then I'm gonna go play some Mario Plus Rabbids Mario Plus Rabbids guys I notice that yes I will get super super high if you haven't guys I hate

come from but chug University sir I come from the University of Tennessee which funny story I had a lot of friends at UT or I had a lot of friends in Knoxville who came to the area to go to the Oakridge the big national laboratory that made the atom bomb out there so a bunch of PhDs working out at Oak Ridge we're buddies of mine and they all asked like oh you know where'd you go to school or whatever now is it say I went to the University of Tennessee and they'd always go oh the butt chuggin school Oh Leonard Dobie man thanks so much for watching buddy how much time have we got left I'll

eat one of these delicious potato chips in your honor right now kettle chips spicy queso no I don't think I'm gonna pass out I can't guarantee it but I might man i-i've never I'm only as I said I'm only really so hot by SFL oh I've only ever kind of passed out once and it wasn't really passing out I made it to the couch I lied down and fell asleep but it was definitely like oh god oh god oh god this is uncomfortable and as soon as I was on the couch as soon as I was in a you know fetal position I was out and I was out like a light for somewhere between four to six hours or something so i've never blacked out from drinking or anything close to it but you know i assumed it was probably something similar in terms of like oh god I need to go to sleep that kind of thing no of course I'm open

evening no I've never seen CCC 4:20 I might have to I might have to check them out actually I am bad at YouTube uh yeah I would assume that probably is because we are Stone I'm bad at YouTube I actually don't I don't subscribe to anybody on YouTube I don't actually I use my I think YouTube's feed technology or they're like feed system is incredible because the more I'm on YouTube the more I'm on YouTube because like they're always feeding me great videos and things I want to watch I never thought I I really never thought I would be into like watching YouTube videos but it's getting its hooks into me so I probably will at some point become into you get into - and start like subscribing to things but for a long time I mostly just used it to watch you like Stephen Colbert clips and Seth Meyers clips like they're really obnoxiously political stuff which I love and but now I'm watching all kinds of great things on YouTube including guys I'm there oh [ __ ] that's a lot of subs Wow Wow you need to check them out see what they're doing right as you might have noticed I've incorporated some drone footage I got a DJI a spark and I've got a DJI Matic on the way because you know once you get one there's so much [ __ ] fun that's all you want to do yeah drones are awesome we're gonna have more drone footage in our videos and stuff just as like b-roll and in in the future mostly because I just think drones are fun putting them in actual videos is probably obnoxious but [ __ ] are they fun - are they fun to fly around which is probably why you've seen some unnecessary drone footage in my videos as of late my reviews as of late again I am so sorry for being obnoxious I think I've already said this once I don't remember I'm very high I'm very high so if I've already beaten this in I apologize make sure that you are following me on Facebook and Twitter because I actually started using them very heavily recently posting updates and things of letting people know the schedules when I do my tolerance break starting next Monday September 11th I will hopefully start doing like a several times a week vlog just nothing I like that term but just explaining my experience sort of going through like oh guys this is how its experimenting blah blah blah blah blah all that fun stuff so look out for that and of course I'll be shooting with some drones there because again it's just fun to do so I'm not sure I was talking about before that but again follow me Facebook and Twitter if you don't we a tweets reviews in both places that way you just don't miss any of that stuff as I post it men you guys have me really wanting to watch this CCC 420 because you seem really remorseful that it's gone and it sounds like a cool channel I'm going to look it up right now as we're speaking which is rude of me CCC 420 dab the logic I see oh no oh yeah it looks like they don't really post that much anymore which is unfortunate you think what that many subs you'd uh you be totally a crutch 420 I'm not I mean I don't watch a lot of weed videos to be honest I know I need you to really sort of get in the community I don't watch as much as I should but what do I think of custom girl 420 I know exactly what I think a question girl 420 and I'm that's you to beauty was say what's up YouTube YouTube yes up YouTube u2's that's what I think of custom grow 420 love them well everybody if you're out there you're not you definitely not I need to watch more weed channels than I do I don't watch enough I mostly still watch Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers clips oh and if you guys don't watch Vsauce you need to be watching Vsauce actually right now just go ahead and open up another tab go ahead and type in Vsauce not Vsauce 2 or vsauce3 just the og original Vsauce just go to popular uploads and just go go get nice and high after this and and have your mind blown crutches decent 10k oh my god Jesus Christ I did not know that that is a lot of money there's a lot of money $10,000 I guess when you have over a million subscribers you know you can do whatever you want or whatever that's that is that is outrageous that is truly outrageous yeah that but that seems crazy but he can go but he could say YouTube's better than anybody for sure yeah once you start saying it oh really whose private property was he trespassing on I wonder I wonder who where and he got arrested for it it must have been trespassing on some pretty 10k in cash to smoke with him what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] who would leak who has that amount of money that doesn't find him I don't know that's just that's crazy that is crazy good for him I guess uh see that makes sense didn't even get busted because it was if it was actually owned by the state that makes a lot more that likes a lot more sense than if or just some personal person's property the state always going to get its vengeance it's pound of flesh of course it's not worth it to smoke with them for $10,000 it's not worth knowing to smoke with it for $1,000 now it might be with him to smoke with that for $100 just for the I'm for the exposure but but any more than that you know I know well I would saw if you guys want any I want this for anybody if anybody wants I'll make a video for you where I go you to you for you and you can i I'll do it for free all right guys should I go ahead and finish this off let's do it let's just finish it off let's let's let's end this baby and then let's hang out for another hour or so here we go three two one Wow that went down the wrong pipe we broke a went down the wrong right breathe whoo [Music] somebody have fun good luck with those dispensaries and dispensaries I'm sorry I mean Aronson I was reading Kappas comment but I think my voice is finally coming back maybe maybe maybe here we go coming back it's coming back it's coming back it's coming back it's coming back I am back I am back we have done 1,000 milligrams whoo we did it we did it the bottle is drained broke two records today the quickest I've consumed 1,000 milligrams and the most consumed in one day consume 1,200 40 milligrams of THC today and consumed a thousand milligrams in less than two hours like an hour and half so breaking wheats records right and left even if my throat is a little [ __ ] up still all right sorry guys let me just keep coughing from just a couple more seconds and bore you with this okay okay okay I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm back I did it I did it kappa oh but first off welcome Pyatt palm of that's how I say or 9p8 pond I'm glad you I'm glad you're here there buddy thank you so much for speaking up in the chat again I am sorry it's taken me a while to speak I need money to go get a tissue actually I'm gonna be right back I'm gonna go blow my nose guys I'll be right back I am so sorry for the dead air excuse me for just a second alright guys I'm sorry about that still having trouble speaking but my nose cleared up at least Jesus I'm sorry this is ribbiting TV I'm sure sorry I keep touching my nose I'm sorry kappa hey buddy um i've been trying to get this out for a while recently i've been speaking with a lot of people in the edible industry um doing different things with them so i will next time i'm speaking with an industry guy speak to them about their wholesale where they get their wholesale flower from and see if i can find an answer about a hookup for you see if we can find out for somebody some way to get some cheap wholesale so i will ask around for you man and see if next time I have an opportunity to do so I promise you because that's a great question and could be useful for me especially especially if we want to start doing some cooking or do some more adventurous stuff on our yes Kirikou is lab certified I believe let me check their website again but I'm pretty sure hold on one second buddy I'm looking up right now for you because I actually I'm looking at up let's see lab tested yes they are tested by I think SC Labs even but they are at Merrill labs certified and you know even I will I'm not that I'm in authority or anything but they I mean that they really are just the best company I've encountered so far that they're just nothing like them um they just leave they sort of do miracle stuff men saying I've done some damage my throat been s have you tried any can't go yet five to ten pounds holy [ __ ] kappa how would you get that back would you would you risk shipping that amount back would you drive it back he's getting busted with that kind of that sort of quantity would be I would guess I mean that would be I would assume I don't know that would be a federal crime I don't I don't know I don't know how that works um but I will I will definitely ask for you man I see if anybody can hook you up with a wholesale level next time I have the opportunity which should hopefully be pretty soon so guys um how I'm feeling at this moment incredibly high it is definitely coming on strong right now my vision is sort of funneling even more than it was before oh right yes for medicinal use only I got you buddy nice emoji usage so yeah it's coming on really high my vision is sort of funneling it even more I have that feeling of living in the past my throat is sort of harshing my buzz a little bit I don't know what happened definitely I would actually say so I singed my throat with that last little bit going down has not been fun but this is actually been a pretty fun trip I'm not at all a paranoid hype not at all like uh I don't yet feel too high I don't feel oh man my throat Jesus maybe guys with one don't drink this much sure ever in this short amount of time that's just foolish that's just foolish and be careful if you do because it seems like you can make your throat a little bit tender unfortunately is that is the way mine feels right now it feels it feels a little on the Scourge side Oh Ben you know I do what I can but in terms of my high I feel pleasantly stone let's see I'm at about an 8 right now and and rising not uncomfortably high yet still in the pleasant range mostly a cerebral high nothing I'm not really feeling it in the body at all no no body effects no like body buzz or anything right now mostly just a cerebral hi smart kappa smart didn't no one can do that so yeah I've been doing it but it's it does a number on the throat or I don't know if I just got it going down the wrong pipe there at the end but my throat is finally starting to come back around to an acceptable level have I ever tried a hemp blunt to wrap I don't believe that I have it is that just a paper that is a blunt paper made from hemp I'm guessing it's probably pretty nice I would think but I've never tried one so good for the throat [Music] by the way I'm still playing a shit-ton a fortnight I am I cannot stop playing for tonight I'm probably hey welcome back I totally recommend it I know it's not for everyone the game can be a bit of a grind it can definitely be a lot of a grind but it's fun I see have been copping a hell of a lot yeah I got some some of this stuck in mine through it we finished this I don't know if you were here when I finished it it's all gone but I burned the throat on the wash a little bit down unfortunately oh that's pretty cool no it just just got caught in my throat on the way that it doesn't like a hell of a good deal kappa yeah just got cutting my throat on the way down no smoking just when finishing it just and made my throat burn yep that's it as I said while you're gone can new record most THC in one day and fastest THC can fastest consumed and went to 1,000 milligrams did that all in 90 minutes and I had 1240 grams of THC today well very high about 1/8 I would say right now what it was what I was saying earlier I'd say 8 is a pretty accurate reflection speech getting slurred having a tough time remembering what I was just talking about I still enjoying the high sylheti the highest still and enjoyable high still jonesing to play Mario Plus Rabbids Kingdom battle really hate those [ __ ] Rapids though really hate those goddamn Rapids like seriously why did they think that anybody wanted Rabbids oh nice dude kappa this dad is four III do not know I do not know anything about wholesale purchases almost done with the coughing I think I'm very stoned too but we're all very stone together which is a wonderful uniting feeling kirova is so goddamn strong i forgot which one you got what what what flavor of 150 milligrams the three dose did you get that is awesome kappa you are you do your research shirt you do your research wait wait Edison what Oh ginger - yes my favorite - love the ginger - I love the ginger - it's so good I love molasses cookies the jr. - is just so good so so good I'm going to eight and climbing i would say and i keep saying edison because I don't want to mispronounce your first name can you can you help me is there like a a rhyme guide you can give me Edison to help pronounce your first name just cuz I want to make sure I get it correct just say sounds like rhymes with something like that give me some hints here that would be kind of you sir Mario plus rabbit's kingdom battles more imma imma more I'm Addison more i'ma where does more i'ma come from if you don't mind me asking where I'm up that's a great name I like it a lot or imma push my name with that ending hmm I can hear my Great Dane barking you probably could do more i'ma so wherever there's more i'ma come from and that that makes subtle sense with how I'm seeing it there that's I think how I would have guessed it would have said the frowns I I might have said more rain my action more I memories yeah so I'm glad I asked now I'm just having trouble remembering what I'm just talking about Mario Plus Rabbids great on the switch the switch is an awesome console if you who would have ever thought Nintendo would have made a great console again love it a lot Graeme's games great for tonight game is awesome looks currently reading the incredible book hey Jerrod welcome man glad they're glad you made it oh Nathaniel okay well welcome to Fanueil oh that's cool that's from an 80s show that is your mom's favorite character um that's a really cool story in fact and welcome to Jerrod we were just talking about something thank you who the [ __ ] knows something something great we're talking about Mariah and how to pronounce it it is an odd name yeah I like it it's a very very cool name and it's a cool cool one to use as it as a screen name because it's so unique I forgot what you're talking about we're talking about how high I am that's for sure Jerrod we actually already finished the bottle just a little while ago so that is a thousand milligrams I am my highest coming on strong Oh sing the name of the book pipe on thank you so much um oh okay well that makes total sense that you would need to keep that on the DL name of the book though and congratulations on getting your MD that is a wonderful accomplishment and a rare accomplishment and a fait great one and thank you so much for Pyatt pom for reminding me oh if that's how you say your name or P upon the name of the book I am reading almost finished with sapiens by you've all what is how do you pronounce his last name just a second this is an incredible book guys you've all arrived it's just a book about the history of Homo sapiens as the name sort of implies it's sort of just and oh yeah I am definitely super going to be super hi I'm already super high and going to be super high Earth than I am right now so it's a Wow a dispensary can sell no more than 8 ounces of cannabis okay so you even get a half pound seeing the half pound is the most you can get an a single day and clear Pam is the most I've ever sell seen sold to a at a dispensary I don't think I've ever seen a half pound being sold so read the book sapiens it's incredible has some it will sort of change your it's one of those rare books that is sort of paradigm-shifting and viewpoints the way it makes you think about humanity in the way it makes you think about the idea of the liberal democracy is sort of the end of history just incredible I utterly love it that again that sapiens by Yuval her I I think that's how you pronounce their name great book I just finished also the defenders on the old Netflix my partner and I just finished that we both would like to liked it okay we watched all the preceding Marvel shows other than Iron Fist which we gave up on and this one has the same problem that all the Marvel shows have which is it is so so so slow to start but takes you know it takes a long time to get off the ground once this one finally gets rolling it's fun it's fun it's it's not great it's not incredible by any stretch but it's fun and the fun sort of conclusion to some of those storylines and I really like really like Jessica Jones a lot just good Jones is great so the defenders is fun it's fun on Netflix just get recapping you guys or what I've been doing recently now all I can think about is what I'm going to be doing for the rest of your coming up no no I'm not feeling so nervous at this point I know I'm definitely gonna get higher and I haven't peaked yet either for sure I don't think I definitely gonna continue to get higher my throat is feeling a little better now so I think everything's gonna be okay I think everything's gonna be okay oh wow two hours to peak I or two hours to really get going I I'm usually I've usually peaked by two hours and I'm stirring I usually peak in about 90 minutes I would say and have usually started to come down by about two hours so and I just now hit the two hour mark from the first half of this bottle so I have a lot more to come on still so we shall see how high I get um but man I now all I can do this thing about food I got the munchies for Rizal's Kappa when you come into California if you make it into Long Beach I'm taking you out to MVPs buddy that is my go-to if you don't mind if you don't mind like meat that is because it's just a burger place but god damn it's the best burger place it's so good so so good I'm taking you out there if you ever come by we're actually if anybody anybody that's my offer anybody comes to visit sweets HQ and in Long Beach California I'll take you out to MVPs we'll go out for a burger together and we'll enjoy it we shall eat and be merry what'd you guys think of Game of Thrones finale last week I enjoyed it quite a bit it does I know there are a lot of problems with the most recent season there are a lot of them are self-evident I don't really need to go over them all right dude yo come on out dude kappa see you or you are just straight-up it great start to finish do you have any problems with the sort of temporality problems them the the the how how are they characters getting so are you are you have any problems with how like the characters are getting from point A to point B so quickly and motivations are sort of changing sure dude please do by all means yes that is a very sad thing for Kappa Kappa does not live in Cali and and has to get his edibles through other means as all will say as always she'll say he can reveal more if he chooses my god I had also asked earlier are there any specific companies not that you want me to review products of but companies in particular like the whole organization so they have to be big they have to be something that has a lot of products some diversity in their products to preferably can't be just like one chocolate bar and one dark chocolate bar has to be you know like they have several different kinds of products you know it can be all be brownies and cookies but they they have to have more than one thing I'm looking to do reviews of companies in particular I know we're all Tinley gonna try to do ones like you know Korova Kanaka lol edible of Voodoo sours cushy punch cannon candy is you know the bigger name brands and things of that nature but if there's some out there that I'm missing things that I'm just screaming out to you that you want me to review let me know and I'll be happy to do so to all those videos are going to take a lot more work than our traditional wheats reviews which is part of the the one month long this one month-long tolerance break that we will be doing here on wheats man so uh now the to explain my hi I oh my god it is starting to come on very very very incredibly strong it's hard just I'm barely even falling along and chat at this point I see Kappa and more I'm talking and conversing and having a good time but really following along that's pretty difficult to be honest it looks like they're having a lively lively conversation but I'm really not paying much of attention I'm just talking about my own things and guess at this point I don't eat another potato chip I think Ketel i'm degrading your brand by associating with marijuana come and get me come and get me um so um what else what else what guys kappa kappa i forgot you work in some capacity with a br or you have the are or what's the what's your BR vibes that's the I have not tried sundar storm Candy's I've not even heard of sundar storm candies but I'm looking them up right now thunder storm edibles canna candies [Music] ooh they got fancy packaging Oh I have seen these actually I have seen these around I have not picked them up because they are mostly just belts they have a lot of belts and I've never had a belt do anything for me other than keep my pants up but have you tried them kappa are they supposed to be good or are you just curious alright now that you brought them up i'll be happy to do them giving them a review but i've it just curious to know if what I'm in store for it or if I know if you know what I'm in store for yeah I've seen them I've seen that in a couple of dispensaries now that I've looked at their packaging their packaging looks nice I just have always passed them up because I've reviewed probably five different rain you know sour belts candies from different manufacturers and never had one that worked for me google them more I'm a yo-yo they're very pretty packaging that's very nice packaging I've seen them in a couple of places it's very Hindu looking but but I'll get my chance next time I see them they usually a good web presence is a good sign for how reliable and attaboys because you will often find that the shittier the company the less of a web presence it has which is perhaps not much of a surprise if you think about it but but I definitely noticed that as a correlation but like yep Simon beavers in the house welcome hey man I'm so glad you made it I'm glad you made it for the stream we have already finished slambien or as of about 20 minutes ago we finished the bottle we're waiting for the effects to really get here yes I agree this package the packaging does look relatively elegant and I am a sucker for nice packaging that's another thing that usually goes hand in hand with good edibles I have not tried dab Zilla or al Lancaster but I are they an edible brand or are they just a concentrate spread I'd be willing to give them a try because I like the name DAB Zilla so all our slime bener yeah already finished it super high probably animate half rising maybe nine who knows getting higher higher we've talked about a lot of things we've talked a lot about I can't get these kids to shut up about Mario plus rabbits Kingdom bill they're on the switch I'm like guys nobody gives a [ __ ] about Mario Plus rabbits nobody gives a [ __ ] about rabbits Michael EE thanks bud thank you so much for watching man I really appreciate you coming out and watching I appreciate you spreading the word we will we will see you on a later one buddy later man it does remind me a little bit of the infused creations packagings more I'm as well which has me a little worried but it does look fancier than that so it's you know it's not a total I don't want a toad that of a product I would definitely give them a chance and now that now that they've been brought up and I'm trying to remember I know I've seen that at least two dispensaries as I can go back to one and get up there um believe it or not we're all in Kessler I used to drink a little bit I've never been a huge drinker but I actually haven't well I took it back I had a couple of drinks for the first time maybe two or three weeks ago but I don't drink much I'm not a big drinker it I get sick pretty quickly from drinking like a couple of drinks I get I'm usually already like feeling pretty nauseous so I don't do it as often as as I might like cuz I get sick pretty easily from it but all right dude I understand I'm gonna have to leave pretty soon and get some food masu and yes I mean this weather has been so stupid it's so goddamn hot right now I did a review earlier today I was sweating like a madman it's $41 for a thousand milligrams Kentico good deal kappa that's a yes that's a good deal $45 is the nor is is the price i see it most often I've seen it you can if you look hard enough you can find 440 the cheapest I've ever seen it and I've only ever found out one dispensary at this price is 35 sounds good dude later man I am Not sure oh dude oh no oh no stay safe man that's terrible I mean I've heard about the the the Wildfire out there and how awful it is crazy weather we're having all across the country right now unfortunately what am I going to eat or Lancaster I haven't decided just yet there's a world of possibilities but it has to be within a segways ride from me or a mini segways right for me because that's all the farther I am willing to move and the only thing I can operate right now responsibly so that's that'll be my limiting factor is how far away it is segway ting right give it to me to wear Lana Castro gave me this yes ah all right man enjoy that pizza eat a slice for me eat a slice for me dude yes this hot weather has been brutal brutal brutal brutal brutal brutal even like the beach has been you know there hasn't even been a breeze to really sit salvage it or save it it's just been too [ __ ] hot but I am if I couldn't let pizza do guys we get start talking stop talking about food this is dangerous this is dangerous you're getting me you're getting me off off course here yeah give me give me give me one char give me like you know 55 degree days again give me hoodie weather give me lazy pants whether I want to wear sweatpants again you know I want to be I want to be a real a real lazy son of a [ __ ] and start wearing sweatpants again oh my god guys kappa [ __ ] you [ __ ] you oh my god I'm so high I'm so hungry I'm so hungry well we successfully finished this bottle yes winter and cloaked in quotations for sure slimy [ __ ] yes as winter as it can get in Southern California as Daniel Tosh once said like I think it was joke was something like people say you know when I say live in Los Angeles people say but I love the seasons I miss the seasons and he said yeah we have seasons too just not the shitty ones which is pretty true get full of can't you out of the dispensary freshmen I don't have any quarters Kappa I can't I don't have any queries I actually I'm genuinely curious to know how much money is in there because I we have laundry we won't have laundry in our unit there's there's laundry in the building we but it takes quarters so we don't have to go to pizzeria matzah oh that sounds so [ __ ] good dude okay I'm gonna be good I'm gonna be signing off soon guys just to let you know to

take care of the one really appreciate you watching as always we will see you on a future review and slamming beter enjoy that soup which is a terrible choice for such a hot day peace out", "LbDVvYE64Bk": "[Music] glory be friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and look at this little puppy hook-shaped doohickey I've got here today Tara from Kiva Kiva guys we reviewed Kiva products before nothing quite like this we've only reviewed their chocolate bars which are among my favorite edibles if a little pricey they are delicious and today we are looking at their espresso beans coated in dark chocolate not only is this the first time I have had the tera kiba product this is the first time I've had chocolate-covered espresso beans so I'm excited on two fronts that's my dog Newton the back there everyone say hi so let's go ahead and open this up take ourselves bite and explain how wheats works so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I am going to take this edible eat some of it in front of you here not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but I rest assured I will eat the next the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because

gummies they get it rather delicious and they call me down but you got to be careful if you eat one why cuz they're spooky spooky huh I'm just spooky right yeah I guess you'd shown yeah yeah that's so good and also so spooky spooktacular oh I already know how to say it they're just spooky they are good [Music]", "cjQJx2fHaDg": "thank you for joining us for another episode of inside Saints today we will be showing you how to medicate using edibles [Music] hi my name is Tim I'm a manager here Saints I wanted to talk to you about edibles a little bit today the trick with edibles it is finding the right dose unlike smoking when you take an edible you don't feel the effects right away it usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour sometimes even longer before you actually feel the effect so the trick with edibles is to find out what's the right dose for you and then not take too much the nice thing about edibles is that when you take it it won't wear off as quickly as smoking on the effects will last about five to six hours so I find that they're really good for sleep because I can take one before I go to bed and it will last the whole night I'll get a really good night's sleep I'll wake up feeling refreshed let me show you this is the Bigfoot bar it's a chocolate bar by Uncle herbs this is the dark chocolate and one I like this one because it's easy to dose let me show you one so I just we have a chocolate bar and they divide it up into 10 little squares so you can break these squares off each square is about 10 milligrams so generally 10 milligrams one of these is what I recommend is a starting dose if you're not sure what's a good dose for you it's kind of a safe bet to go with 10 milligrams if you're someone who's a little bit nervous about it or if you're just someone who is affected really strongly by different medications you might even want to break one of those in half and just start with five milligrams so these you can try to break them off into different sections like a Hershey's bar they're kind of scored so one of these is just a good starting dose you want to take it and then wait at least an hour before you take more what happens with some people's they'll take it to wait 23 minutes not feel anything and take more and then by the time it actually kicks in it's been what they've had too much so butter balls are a little tricky because it once you do take too much you're kind of stuck on that train for the next five or six hours so if you do find yourself in that since you where you're a little bit too - edibles it's good to just drink lots of water maybe lay down take a nap taking a shower often helps or CBD can help calm down if you're feeling a little bit of anxiety from too much THC so in general edibles are really nice just because the longer effect a lot of people also have success with edibles that they have lung issues and can't really smoke elbows are a nice way to use the cannabis without damaging your lungs in further so in general I really love edibles and they're great for sleep they're great for that longer duration and there's lots of different lots of different ways there's a lot of different candies and stuff personally I like we have some that are more of like a salty snack but there's some pretzels there's some Chex Mix lots of different options so there's something for everyone thanks for joining us today don't forget to Like and subscribe below join us next time for another episode of inside sakes [Music] [Music]", "Fu7hVLQkFUI": "hey how are you know much I mean I'm good you look

gummies look on me down not bad right they're pretty good yeah Thursday's gonna be cake on the presentation you killed that presentation you", "0oEIT7sO95s": "great mike here welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel whichever case may be i am really trying to get back into the whole swing of things and it's taking me some time so please forgive me my my times and everything have been off but i will get back into the swing of it and i will get the reviews out we will get this going yet again but today we are doing a lead haul video from true bliss organics and i think it was mesa so they have cute little bags um i had to go in twice because the first time i went in i got the um flower and the concentrate and the second time i went in i was like oh yeah we're gonna do something special for the channel finally being monotonized so i went back and we got some edibles so let's see what we got okay so and they're all mixed so this is true infusion 100 milligame grams per package these have 50 milligram brownies per piece [Music] some of these were made with rso and others were made with flour i believe these were made with flour it was almost like um they they made um thc butter the flour and made it out of the brownies now if they'd use that with concentrate or distillate you wouldn't taste the flour nearly as much but the brownies do taste pretty grassy because we already opened one package so we had we had we had to get you know our edible on at that time so uh we also got tipsy turtle 200 milligrams um candies chocolate candies chocolate caramel candies in them this is a 200 milligram package there are four 50 milligram turtles they're really cute too and then on that we also got the 100 milligram turtles and i had to taste it so it is actually really good they do use distillate or concentrate in their um candy making so you don't really taste the cannabis as much so you have to kind of be careful because it would be easy to kind of overdose on so it will not overdose but take in a lot because they are actually really good and you don't taste the cannabis nearly as much so we got this fubar uh milk chocolate thousand milligram chocolate bar and then we got some guys don't laugh at me then we got a flourish these are no nobody better lay a finger on my choco bee treat chocolate pb treat and these are 300 milligram little peanut butter treats i guess all right they're really good so let's what i hear maybe it was yeah i believe that was right yeah because one of them infused i believe this was the one they complete fuse with rso and or this one was infused with rso and this one was infused with flour so you can definitely tell the difference i'd have to eat them again to make sure but you can definitely tell the difference between them oh geez candies these are blackberries and cream these are indica 300 milligram thc gummies are 30 milligrams per gummy like the never ending bags i love it so we have this ice cream cakes live red resin gold uh goldsmith extracts so since we haven't smoked yet in this video i say we do it now since this is the first concentrated pulled out so let's see what she looks like sugar wax maybe so let's see i love some of these you can't see where the plastic ends and the top begins or whatnot so you got to find it but here's the little container there you are there let's see what we got let's get here bad boy open don't do this at home bad for your keys my teeth are already bad so which reminds me i went to a dentist appointment today because now i can get my teeth fixed and get all this going and did you know dental implants can be 52 000 i was like holy [ __ ] wow my car doesn't cost that much it's like wow that's insane to me so yeah that was interesting it was a very interesting uh experience oh my goodness oh i'm gonna have to say that it's pretty clean but this is not and so we're going to you know taste it i'm going to taste this so we're going to wash it off here okay so here take a look at these it is very frosty i really like it i'm trying not to let it fall but give you guys a nice look there it's really pretty i mean it just sparkles so um i think the cheapest route was 22 000. holy holy [ __ ] that was insane i was it definitely could be by surprise you know because you see all these ads and stuff on social media implants 12 you know 1200 dollars implants three thousand dollars yeah that's her dude [Applause] hey wow i haven't even put in yet oh my my neighbor is walking his cat on a leash [Applause] so we are celebrating free my free my cure finally got monotonized so we are finally a paid channel it is super cool i can't wait um so now we get to have some of those extra bonus little features that everybody else gets that we usually don't have so see if we can get it to sparkle for you you're pretty there's always guys but cancer [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression and was a good and putting it broken before i put it in there he's like oh my god okay and then we got potent planet concentrate it is not open anyways again i was smoking here okay gotta be smarter than the container i take it and i am not hmm well if i get it off i'll show it to you however i'll be doing a review on it too so you'll still get to be able to see it but i try to keep the branding with them because otherwise i forget then we have these baked brothers 300 milligram uh watermelon thc syrup that we're going to make a couple of things out of which will be a lot of fun i get confused two organic cannabis with a conscience so i've actually been seeing these in dispensaries a lot more lately which i think is kind of interesting in one aspect and very irritating in another i'm glad they're finally putting something out like rso however this is not our asm um and the reason why i say this is because rso is made from flower only flower there's only one place in the valley that i know of for a fact that does it that way and that's phoenix tears every time i talk to a dispensary or a dispensary owner they say oh no it's tram but that's still rso that is not rso rso is not the way to make the product it is the actual name of the product it is not it's how it it's not how it's made so uh it's actually the name of the product what happens with trim is a can't get high enough to really do much good um ask mr tommy king um the reason why is because there's a lot of cbd in that because there's leaves and stems and that's where a lot of your cbd is now in doing that those of you that have watched my channel or channels like me for a while in the past you'll know that what cbd does is counter the psych effects of thc so if you're really feeling loopy you're tired and you need it to go away because you whatever reason um take some cbd and it will sober you up very quickly when you're talking about rso and the reason why i know how this is done a little bit of this because i've talked to a lot of them and i've made my own i've talked to rick simpson i got the directions directly from him and why it is that way so um that's kind of how it works um this is not true rso now that being said um this is cannabis oil so there is still a very huge benefit for cannabis oil now this is not going to cure cancer it's just not going to do it um however it will help with pain um it will help with topical things so let's say you've got a bad cold sore you can actually take some of this put a dab on your finger rub it on that cold sore and it'll help it heal faster so there's things that this is really good for um i have a mouth full of really bad teeth and infection um and you know you of course you think that you you went to a dentist uh did he send you home with any antibiotics no they're not going to do that for a couple of months but they'll do that right before the surgery i'm like so i have to live with the infection for two more months i don't get it so yeah it's fun i love doctors today so much fun so but you can do this one or two ways because i've been having a hard time with a lot of things and been stressed out i don't sleep really well so we're trying to get that under control um i've been in a lot of pain because i'm you know still waiting for the surgery next month but one of the things that i can do if i can open the wagon is um take this either just take the whole thing and shoot it you gotta have a chaser um trust me gotta have a taster um or you can put it directly on whatever it is so i can put it directly on my tooth or i can just swish it straight down either way it'll help the same um if you put it directly on it'll help a little bit faster but you end up with that taste in your mouth and it is not a pleasant taste sorry but it is not so what i've learned is if you stuff on them a minute it warms the oil up inside otherwise it's really hard to push the oil through through the syringe so i swallowed that entire ground because that's just a stalker um now this will one more it'll help with a few things will help with the tooth pain it'll help with any infection it does help with all of those things it really helps with pain especially when i'm trying to sleep at night so i did a couple of these last week and i'm gonna do a couple of leaves this week and see how it helps um but i just want to make that clarification that this is not genuine rso oil it is cannabis oil um i'm really hoping dispensaries can jump on board and make sure to put the right names on things because when they don't it makes it really hard for patients what happens is these patients go in and they they've heard about rso and oh i've heard it cured somebody's cancer and i have cancer and if this isn't secure and they think they're getting it as the cure that is so wrong so um yeah that's something that that i really hope uh dispensaries can jump on board you know just take that word off of you know just take rso off of the product make it cannabis oil um it'll sell just the same but it is not true not true uh rso unless it is made with flour only so now that's over let's keep going so i got a little bit of flour tang brush wow let's punch it wow i hate sayings hate saying this um this smells like a guy's bad bo like i don't know how to say this yeah yeah i mean this it doesn't smell like good i mean of course i'm gonna smoke it but it doesn't smell very good it it's pungent wow that's tang breath you know my husband drinks thing and um didn't smell like that okay let's see uh so oh no saguaro breath like this i'm gonna smell like one feet deep which can be worse than that i know mine can't be bad no that's not bad okay so it's not a chemical that they're growing with that stinks it's the product and which it doesn't mean that the product is bad don't get me wrong um that's not what that means by any means most of the time what that means when you can when you have a clear smell like this from the product and you have nothing covering it usually means it's pretty clean it's a sweet um i don't even know i'm gonna have to think about that one i'm not sure you can definitely smell the sweet but i can't place the rest of it it's very interesting it's almost like an herbally i wanted to say tea but i don't know as i throw it on the ground okay let's see here um these were in the bags we hand you one of these when you buy a drink and food item together so they have a little cbd i believe it was only cbd cafe there um at the dispensary so if you want to go to the dispensary you can also pick up a nice fun drink they also and this one's kind of an interesting thing the first time you go in you'll either get 20 off for 20 um because she told me what the price was and my price was different um because you get the more you buy the better the prices so however um one of the things that they do do is with all of their new customers they or anybody who spends over a hundred dollars they give this five dollars off your next order card it's to pay for gas so that you that are your however much gas is on them well five dollars worth so that's what they they kind of try to do with their thing is kind of cool and then they do the point system there um i'm trying to think she told me i'm hoping i can remember i'm so bad i i actually had to go in i went in twice uh the first time i went in i got concentrate and stuff and went out put it in track and and husband was like did you get any edibles i'm like [ __ ] so i ran back in and i got those so i had i had two people helped me there and they both went over it but so um we got lots of fun so we got three different sugar waxes and crumbles we and i'm not gonna open all of these i'll show you the back edges so we got black mamba sugar um green crack sugar and now and lighter sugar now twice three times fast you can kind of see it in there a little let's see i know okay so we have afghanistan blackberry shatter which is a hundred percent indica my favorite hurricane shatter kosher kush shatter durban berry shatter tells fire shatter og kush chatter bubba blast shutter chocolate thai shatter amnesia haze shatter green crack shatter come on and train wreck shatter so there it is that is it looks like all kinds of good yummy stuff let's leave it on a high note get it i know i'm not funny this is one of my favorites because it's 100 independent which is the licorice chef i like starfish look at this so i hope you guys have had a really good day [Applause] my financial thing it's been fun so yeah we're gonna do so my surgery is february 16th now that was [Applause] as always guys [ __ ] cancer [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] depression and what's good and i'll get the bad um so i hope you guys have a great evening i will see you tomorrow sometime mwah mad love and i didn't notice the comments on my apologies hi brendan i i'm not too bad um i'm live just sitting back waiting waiting for surgery see what happens so yeah and that'll be february 16th so and my mouth really hurts because of the inspections but and i was i was just like oh my god he even told me about it but he said something about that they would do that like in two months and i'm like so i have to keep the infection for two months and i didn't think to say i didn't say anything out loud i should have he didn't so yeah oh my god that's just nuts so as always have a great night", "HKg52OJhCA4":

"[Music] 500 milligram lead cereal bars for 12 bucks 300 milligrams of bags of chips for 10 400 milligram breakfast cereals we breakfast cereals for $11 and not only that but all the products are pretty tasty too this is just a small sampling of the great value you can expect from lol edibles and nearly ubiquitous edible manufacturer here in Southern California sounds too good to be true right well that's because it is welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana edible review show where we do our damndest to help you make sense of your dispensary this is a show where we try to save you from throwing away your hard-earned money on dud ass edibles and speaking of gun ass edibles today we're going to take a deeper look at LOL edibles where LOL presumably stands for lies on lies we have reviewed a variety of LOL products on wheats and so far have found them to be all greatly exaggerating their potency LOL edibles conveniently does not have an independent tasting testing laboratory rate their product or if they do they do not display it anywhere on their products packaging or on its the website without an independent testing body there are seemingly free to make up whatever dosage they want to put on their packaging and while I certainly cannot prove at this time they are exaggerating their potency my extensive experience with high potency edibles leads me to believe that they are full of [ __ ] so one of the cardinal rules of edibles is you get what you pay for with a few exceptions and we pay $10 for an edible that claims to have 400 milligrams of THC unless you see that independent laboratory verifying those results I would be pretty skeptical of that claim and lol edibles is the king of these shitty shenanigans an another tip-off that they may be less than honest is the taste of their products they usually print is pretty great but a 500 milligram edible should taste at least a little terrible these don't why well most likely because they're lying about how much THC is actually in the product let's compare them to say a 500 milligram kuroh an\u00edbal the kirova product will likely cost and double the lol edible or more and it will taste far Wars and while this might sound weird to say that's very much a good thing two hours after eating an lol a 500 milligram lol edible I'm stone-cold sober like a lifetime lifetime teetotaler but two hours after a 500 milligram Korova edible and I'm [ __ ] over the moon and probably under my covers passed out asleep so let's go back and talk about their website again it's [ __ ] laughable and that's four tabs products about contact and order there order tab seems to it seemed seems to be in good working condition which makes sense because I see this [ __ ] everywhere everything else on their website though god damn what a [ __ ] show the products tab only Keynes contains a small sliver of their products and the pictures look like they were taken on a crusty iphone 3gs by some bored seven-year-old the contact tab of course doesn't do a goddamn thing it's a completely dead link no way to contact them on their contact me tab my guess never worked they don't really want you to contact them they know you're pissed at them why don't they want to hear from you and actually if you really really really do want to get ahold of them just look at the bottom of their page and there's a link to their email and Instagram so you can contact them there psyche those are dead links too they just want you to think that they're able to be contacted but they don't really want you to know they're your feedback because they know they [ __ ] you they know that they're lying to you and they know that you're pissed they don't want to hear from you and finally let's talk about that about page that shows up on their website here's what it says on I quote the medical cannabis industry needed a well respected brand of edibles that patients can rely on for quality and reliability while tasting great lol edibles aims to take the industry by storm by providing great customer service and amazing products you can find LOL edibles throughout the Los Angeles Orange County and San Diego regions at fine reputable medical dispensaries ask your dispensary for LOL edibles today what a load of [ __ ] horseshit let's take that sentence-by-sentence here so I agree that the medical cannabis industry needs a well respected brand but lol edibles sure as [ __ ] ain't it they have the audacity to say that patients can rely on their quality and reliability they also brag about their customer service you know the one you can't actually reach out to or get in contact with them in any way shape or form so guys ask your dispensary the opposite ask them to stop selling these products tell them they are inadvertently ripping off their customers or maybe intentionally ripping off their customers I don't know the only true thing about that sentence or excuse me about that about page is that you can find them throughout LA and Orange counties as unfortunate as that is so I've tried the majority of the Ella Buhl's products but not all I will confess I've never tried their boob cubes or G bars but you know what at this point I never will and I don't care if they're actually good these guys have taken enough money from the pocket of consumers wheats will never review any of their products again their name is lol edibles but the only one are laughs the only ones laughing are them and they're laughing all the way to the bank let me just be totally here to click totally totally clear here to wrap up do not buy any lol edibles products do not let your friends buy their [ __ ] tell your dispensary not to carry this [ __ ] garbage leave them a negative review on weed maps and let's all work together to put these scumbags out of business thanks guys so much for watching this review and we have nearly 200 other reviews and our archives a tweets reviews.com so please feel free to take a

"8PcaCy-mvYo": "[Music] hola mi amigos and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are taking our second look at the kirova mini cookies that will soon be sweeping the edible nation we have already reviewed their saturday-morning many cookies and this time we are coming at you with the chocolate chip mini cookies available for 10 bucks at most dispensaries a pretty decent value another huge package if you watch my first review on this really my only complaint was the amount of stuff that you have to eat if you want to eat the whole package I know it's designed to be ten servings but let's be honest a lot of us are going to be eating the whole package and there are ten little mini cookies in here and it's a lot to get through fancy packaging really like the packaging outside of the [ __ ] child resistant zipper which is a practical impossibility for me to get open I'm just gonna cut these open with scissors and get right into it I really like the taste of the Saturday morning cookies the chocolate chip cookie I've had one of they're like regular chocolate chip cookies in the past it's not my favorite but it's not terrible by any stretch of the imagination so we'll see how the mini cookies fare let's go ahead and cut into them give them a taste here see how we're gonna like them again I would recommend have some scissors already if you're gonna get these bad boys so here we are here are their adorable little mini cookies they seem smaller than the sorry morning cookies but that could be just a mistake in my brain just pop it in the old mouth okay about what I remember be regular kirova chocolate-chip-cookie like hey les the cookie is way softer than the Saturday morning cookie way way softer and an ever so slight cannabis taste to it but not bad mostly just a okay chocolate chip cookie um I preferred the Saturday morning cookie to these in terms of taste but but these aren't bad so guys I'm gonna eat what eight more some two [ __ ] and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process not how it tastes but how it makes you feel so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching peace two hours have passed and I am back welcome to weed skies and we are talking kirova mini cookies chocolate chip cookies hundred milligrams ten servings each oh they're good they're good I'm at maybe a about a six now maybe five and a half somewhere in there so you know about what you would expect for a hundred milligram product it may be a little bit higher than the traditional hundred milligrams ten bucks pretty good value cases okay they weren't my favorite I again prefer the saturday-morning many cookies in that regard but I in this new edible future that we're all going to have of this hundred milligram limit here in California these are probably going to still be top tier I'm definitely looking forward to finding some more of the new generation of edibles to review I'm hoping and assuming that Korova will still be a quality brand in the future I like the way the packaging is designed except for the terrible child-resistant stuff it's just so difficult to open but i understand they have to do it again to keep up with the regulations but on that I think the packaging is still quite handsome and I do like the additional information on the back of having like ingredients and nutritional information and all that fun stuff didn't really have that before so good to see it on there so yeah that's gonna be another thumbs up for me of the new generation of Korova reviews or edibles excuse me still it is not as good as their current edibles that they have out there there are 150 s 250 s yada yada yada so on and so forth stock up on those because those are going to be better values for sure if your dispensary still carries those and these grab the original line first but you know if they only have these you know it'll it won't it won't kill you and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always

i just want to show you my aldi's haul um it is 5 30 p.m it's been a hectic day i was doing my cardio and denver started having her seizures so she has seizures every six to ten weeks or so and she has cluster seizures they last anywhere from like 45 minutes to two plus hours so it's really sad but here she is she's doing a lot better we have a whole mess of beds over here i had all the beds laid out beds against the wall so she wouldn't like hurt herself because she flails like crazy during them so this one was 90 minutes long so i'm 90 minutes behind today but that's okay i am a dog mom and it's my responsibility to make sure she's okay and just talk to her keep her calm it's really sad but i want to show you my aldi haul it's just like my essential items and a couple things that i don't usually get i guess and then one really exciting thing that came in the mail so anyways it's monday peak week for my powerlifting meet super super excited i just went in and i hit my openers for all my lifts and it was just super super easy so stay tuned hey i'm the sweetest puppy in the world it's really sad that i have to have seizures jack's like doesn't even phase him he's like whatever all right so first of all i get all my lettuce from there their garden salad is like 79 cents there's a lot of like the extra stuff in there um but cheap price so that's what you get i get my shredded lettuce there it's a little bit thicker than like the better brands i guess and then all of my spinach i get there it's like a dollar 29 for eight ounces so definitely get your spinach there it's really good spinach i was craving some waffles these looked really good nothing like special about them they're the macros for two waffles again they're only like a dollar there and then just a cucumber their eggs are like 70 some cents as well and i got this orange chicken for justin he's coming tonight and he loves the stuff they don't have holidays where he is up in minnesota so i got some orange chicken they have the two good yogurt there as well it's only a dollar something there a dollar 20 something it's usually two for three dollars so i've got another one over here vanilla kind and then i got my egg beaters there they are like 298 so i'm stocked up on those for a little bit some dog treats and then my favorite popcorn if you guys saw my last holiday haul i got two more bags of this because i love it so i've got three bags of this now i just finished one i just started a new one so i want to make sure i don't run out and then these this sounded really good white cheddar popcorn it was only a dollar something so i'm like why not per cup it's 40 calories three grams of fat three carbs one protein so not bad and then my favorite english muffins they're literally so so good like you cannot beat these and i think these are like a dollar if even 23 carbs one gram of fat for protein and then i went all the way to not all the way it was literally across the street but i went to harris teeter just for these for the dogs i felt so bad that she had her seizure so um these are usually two for six this brand at harris teeter and all the other brands are like four five to seven dollars each so this is i would say it's a good brand but i don't know i don't need those this is the most exciting part fit butters so i'm gonna show you guys what's inside and then i'm gonna finish taste testing this for another video that i'm posting before after this one so either watch it if you have not seen it or stay tuned because it's coming up next all right the new fit butters monster cookie peanut butter it's a peanut butter with like m m's in it and it's so good super like chocolatey and peanuts like sweet and salty from the peanuts so i definitely recommend this one it's a brand new flavor it's not yet available for sale but when it is get your hands on some i think this is better than eating reese's peanut butter cups and the texture is like thick and creamy all at once so this one is super good i think it's my number two right after independence cake all right i just now got the new fit butters monster cookie peanut butter it's a peanut butter blend with like m m's in it to make a monster cookie it smells like a monster cookie like the dough the batter like you're about to make a cookie um it tastes like a reese's peanut butter but better reese's peanut butter cup because like the sweet and saltiness is totally there and then the text extra texture from the m m's it's super fun and then it's a thick texture let me show you so it is thick but it's still like spreadable mixable all that and oh my gosh i wish you guys can smell this it smells so so good i just love that their peanut butters and their almond butter cashew butters they're all a little bit more thick so the texture is a little bit different than like compared to the runny or like the super smooth that you would expect [Music] definitely want to give this one a try it's i think it's my number two right after independence cake it's a cashew one blend this one is definitely my number two now hello and welcome back it is peak week tuesday the 28th i think it's the 28th um it's been another long day kind of just running errands went to costco for the first time and i wanted to show you my proto this is the cookies and cream it's so good and then this is it in the microwave so i just warmed up for like 20 seconds or so i did a half a serving in there it is literally amazing there's a new launch coming this thursday and you want to make sure that you set the reminders because it sells out within 10 to 20 minutes so stock up and try some proto um you can find it on etsy so set the reminders you will not be disappointed totally worth every single penny but um it's peak week and i'm feeling relaxed i guess and ready i don't know i just wanted to check in with you guys let you know that it's tuesday and i am just trying to get through the week i guess hey guys welcome to day it's wednesday peak week it's really about three days out for my meet um i just want to take you through the day and show you my morning routine right now so right now i'm going to give the dogs their little puppy treats um they are so routine oriented they wait for me um come downstairs and then they go outside denver usually just goes potty really quick and runs back up as soon as she can and then she wants her treat um and then yeah that's how my day starts so then they'll eat their breakfast maybe sometimes they have to wait until they get scrambled eggs with them because they are so high maintenance but um and then i have all my morning supplements i'm i'm out of a lot of stuff right now but oh i can't talk i've not had any water or coffee yet but i would make my coffee after i give them their treats and feed them their food so stay tuned treat betty you want your treat good girl okay let's get this day started by the way these are the best gummy vitamins i've ever had they're super soft and squishy so they're really really gummy and they're sweet and you get 160 servings for only like dollars and seventy something so super good deal um and they're really good so this is how i get my calcium and vitamin d i don't have very much dairy or anything like that in my diet so i have one of those a day i'm gonna have a cha or ginger two in the morning um it's just supposed to like help soothe your stomach and whatnot i don't know ginger is really good for you and these are really tasty the peanut butter kind are my favorite and you can get them at like gnc and other like health food places i believe all right coffee time i've been having one packet of stevia and some of the sugar-free italian sweet cream it is really good i definitely recommend it and i love my mug it actually matches my cookie jar which has candy bars in it look at this guys with my hair on his couch are you comfy he's so weird all right on to my second coffee i put some cashew milk in here put in the microwave for a little bit i had some remainder of my coffee and stuff earlier and then i'm gonna put another packet of my stevia maybe a little bit more of this and fill her up sorry it's so loud my robot is going around and kind of cleaning the floor it's not the best but it does ish the job but really i just want a snack here's my pantry update if you guys have not seen it recently i've got a lot of stuff those are all my boxes of snacks and stuff that i need to review and then i've got some more stuff right there twizzlers are my favorite i'm gonna take these this weekend for my powerlifting meet and this is what i really want they are so good like i said before in another video if you guys have not tried them you need to they are literally the best things i've ever had i will warn you you have to be very careful because you can easily eat like half the bag in one sitting this is only two thirds of a serving so not very much it adds up really fast so you guys need to make sure you weigh your food or some sort of measurement because you could easily eat all of them all right i've got breakfast cooking i've got some eggs going and i'm making some toast with this white sandwich bread from aldi it's only 24 grams of carbs one half gram of fat and they're pretty thick pieces and i weighed them on the food scale because sometimes your bread is way off um you either get actually a lot more calories or less calories because they're not evenly sliced really so fun fact but most of you are not crazy um weighing everything and tracking your food in myfitnesspal for five and a half years straight like me um so i know if you guys want to follow me on myfitnesspal my username i believe is c e lawson08 so you can give me a follow um i'm gonna finish my breakfast and i'll show you guys afterwards i did just make the dogs some scrambled eggs so they're waiting patiently for the eggs to cool down i totally meant to mention that i have like two or three carrots two to three times throughout the day as well um i follow a lot of things that stain efforting says he's a very smart guy and he has the same thing carrots pretty much every meal they are good for your micronutrients and i think they might have a little bit of potassium in them not too much but um yes dan is the man all right here is breakfast got some spinach egg beaters and greek yogurt in there and then my toast with spray butter simple and to the point i try and keep my pre and post-workout meals low fat low fiber and not too much protein not too much carbs depending on how the workout is and today it's going to be super easy and just light since i have my meat in three days all right i am about to head to the gym and i have my hydra jug ready with some salt and my bcaas i have the rule one strawberry margarita in there they're really good and then i'm also gonna have a couple bites of my twisted dough pb and j i love this flavor so there's just a little bit left and i'll probably have i might have all of it we'll see um there's maybe an ounce left i don't think there's quite an ounce though so it's gonna be around like 80 200 calories so i'm gonna have that go to the gym and i think i'm gonna take you guys with me so it won't be too exciting i'm just gonna do light stuff and go through maybe my bench setup i need to really focus on my command so that's the biggest thing and stopping the bar on my chest so i can slow the bar to a complete stop and press really fast rather than waiting longer so um that's the key to trying to break your pr's but all right um i think that's all for now i have some blue contacts and i think i don't know i had these in earlier i definitely had these in earlier sorry guys i'm a little crazy right now i've got so much on my mind but i just wanted to show you what i'm going to have because i'm going to do a full day of eating and just day in the life right i just got back from we actually went to gold's gym and i did not film anything super boring i literally just went through my squat form and everything i did not even go heavy and practice my walkouts and then practice bench and my commands just went up to 135 did singles at 135 just really practiced the commands and stopping on my chest um yeah and then i went through my therapy rehab stretching and stuff that i'm supposed to do so i'm being a good student and i'm having one of my twisted foods meals right now it's some sort of meatballs i just like chopped them all up rice and i think like feta cheese and some sort of green stuff i don't know what the green stuff is but i'm gonna eat this and sorry i did not take you to the gym but like i said it was super boring so i don't really know what else i'm gonna do the rest of the day just try and keep it chill and relax i'm gonna pack my stuff so i guess i will maybe show you guys what i pack for my power lifting meet either in this video or the next video you guys will see how to pack and prep for a power lifting meet all right i need a little bit of coffee so i'm gonna have my beanies birthday cake coffee um so i'm gonna have that for a little pick me up at 3 45 pm and i'm currently editing a youtube video so that will be up soon and i think that's all i'm about to go pack my stuff so i'm just really tired right now i always feel like i'm dragging between like 3 30 and 5 30 or so that's when i like to have a little bit of caffeine and um speaking of beanies this one's good as well christmas pudding i order them from the uk from protein pick and mix or you can order from them in general they might not ship to the us so go through protein pick and mix and you get all kinds of goodies hey do you wanna go for a walk you wanna go for a walk what's that mean you wanna go can you speak speak i can't hear you speak all right let's go good girl how about you sir would you like to go for a walk tell me can you tell me all right i am going to take these crazies for a little walk and then do a few things around the house my vacuuming per usual and a pack so i still keep saying them in a pack but i've been editing youtube videos for a while so i'm being on my game i'm good at this stuff give me a thumbs up for trying but we're gonna go for a stroll probably just a quick one around the block just to get some movement in and then i'll take them for a longer one later even though it is 6 p.m now but when the sun goes down probably around 8 30 i think will be a perfect timing all right i will check in with you guys in a bit all right just go back from the walk you can hear denver panting it's kind of hot out so it's like 80 but it's really cloudy so at least it's not sunny out i'm having a snack now i have the mini joseph's lavish pita and i have a laughing cow cheese fudge this is like the pepper jack whatever chipotle one that we have it's really good if you like a little bit of spicy it's not too spicy so i'm just having one serving which is five mini pitas that's only 80 calories two enough grams of fat 11 carbs three of that being fiber and six protein so it's a perfect little like snack to get me by having lots of water because i'm trying to have just a ton of water um especially because my calories are a little bit lower right now just gonna make my weight which i am about a pound and a half to two pounds below my way in right now so tomorrow's thursday it's gonna make through friday morning that i can eat a little bit more and be above my weight class be i'll probably be like 150 or so when i do compete weight class is 148.8 but i just want to show you my little snack since i decided i'm doing full day of eating and i'm going to vacuum still gonna pack and run to the store for a couple things but that's about it i am about to have a little bit of my dunkaroo proto and there is a launch tomorrow night thursday night so i'm super excited i'm going to be ordering some more a bunch of flavors so there's the macros 188 calories four fat 26 carbs and 11 protein i think for 85 grams so this is almost a full serving there's four servings in here but i'm just gonna have a little bit maybe half of this all right i've got my nightly salad we have tomatoes cucumbers some yellow squash spinach shredded lettuce and walden farms um i think it's like the spicy ranch and then a little bit of salsa

popcorn so like i said in my last video or yesterday this lesser evil popcorn from aldi is the best popcorn i've ever had and the shrewd food baked cheddar those are pretty good as well um i've had this flavor and the pizza flavor but i'm also going to put some of this theater style popcorn spray on my popcorn it's really good and the puppies get some dogsters like frosty paws so cheers to a good night and i'll see you guys in the next video", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "qMtZc7RHbRQ": "[Music] the First Noel the angel did say all right so first things first we have my coffee and fun facts actually got this at Dollar General it's my favorite coffee mug of the year and it was like two dollars and I think I bought like 20 ounces here my nails don't know if I showed you guys my nails not but my nails and yeah so the gingerbread equal comes in these cute little packets and smells really good it smells like a nice gingerbready spiced I don't know sugar it smells really good and I would say it's my least favorite that I've tried out of the soft caramel the pumpkin spice and I have to try the Pedram of it yet but the salted caramel is really really good you need to get Hammond hands on some the gingerbread is still good but it's just not as good as the other ones and I like my gingerbread so next on the list of a non edible thing we have this gingerbread scented candle from Trader Joe's and it smells good it's just not very strong I am a freak about the Bath and Body Works candles so I would go on the grout rather than this one's a little smaller it's 5.7 ounces and it's just not very strong so next we have gingerbread latte speaking of Bath and Body Works this is a retired scent they brought it back and I got it for five dollars last week literally my favorite scent from them one of my very favorites I mean they're all most of them really good but gingerbread latte it smells so good they have a lotion with of it as well so I recommend getting both and you can get your hands on some it's definitely a good seasonal fun scent that everyone's going to give you compliments on Denver is here for the tastings so next we have some gingerbread coffee I guess I could have showed you that with the coffee as well but it's Archer farm - got it from Target and a little pretty good smelling things right here do you think tell it so I actually don't have that in my coffee cup right now but smells pretty good it doesn't smell as strong as some of the others and I actually have a peppermint mocha one in my coffee right now and that tastes really good so I put kind of a mocha but then I put the gingerbread cookie seasoning or excusing sugar in it and it's pretty darn good so all right excuse me miss she just really wants into the tasting all right so I can sip this as we go and ice doesn't melt completely and become watery we have here and the gingerbread Irish cream cheers to myself let's go and get the check so it actually smells really really good smells super sweet I love sweet so let's go ahead and give it cherry mmm that is really good so I just put this on the rocks and has a really nice milky creamy taste and a little bit of spice to it I like that it's very subtle not too strong you can definitely drink a lot of that I think that'd be really good at their coffee and it would be really good with some ice cream oh that sounds really good became ice cream got some of that as well well this one is definitely a go and I think I got this at world market so pick yourself up some if you can find it because it's definitely a good holiday drink to have a sippin or for dessert or with dessert whatever you prefer I do recommend this because it's not too gingerbread it's not over-the-top but it's a perfect amount of sweetness and it's going to satisfy your sweet tooth craving alright let's go ahead and get into some protein bars so I have three time protein bars you're gonna start with one Gingerbread I do not like one bars but the package is really cute and I think I got that at Trader Joe's so one bar is 230 calories 9 grams of fat 23 carbs and 20 protein and it's the ice Gingerbread flavor again I'm not a fan of 1 bars at all if you look back a few months I did a protein bar tribe video tried I think 19 different protein bars and one bars do not hit the spot so here's what real on the outside I don't know if it's really half of it covered or not but half of it is covered and oh all right honestly it smells like dog food smells like a bag of dog food okay it's not bad definitely not their worst one it's not two gingerbready with my little white chocolate tastes just like a whoop sweet white chocolate I guess but I don't know the texture is so boring just like rubbery and just I don't know I don't really care for it if there are more crunchy things I don't think I got any crunchy things stuff they're not even crunchy for those macros not worth it you can eat two built bars we're the price of that alright next up we have optimum nutrition cake bites and the gingerbread flavor now thank you very little butter if you put them in the microwave first so I'm gonna pop them in four and a second and it's a cute little pack comes with three of these little cake bites and smackers on here 210 Macker seven fat 26 carbs and 20 proteins I'm gonna put these in the microwave to make it nice and melty actually I'm gonna leave one out to compare alright I might have done it too long I did it for like 12 seconds but they burst it out the top so we're gonna try the not cooked one first since those are probably a little hot right pretty tough and I'm making a mess all right that's all you're gonna get [Music] okay first of all this has much more of a strong Gingerbread flavor than the one bar definitely can tell that it's a gingerbread but I'm really interested in trying it when it's a little melted so this is nice and soft now definitely much better texture to enjoy that makes the protein bar from a five and a half two and eight and a half oh my gosh totally game-changer that is so good actually try it next up we have this limited edition Laura bar gingerbread now that I'm seeing this I think I got this one at Trader Joe's and I maybe got the one by there as well I don't remember I think I wrap both of them there but the macros on this we have 190 calories and 9 grams of fat 25 carbs and four proteins this is not really a protein bar okay it's a fruit and nut food bar so here's this gingerbread food bar looks pretty healthy smells like a fruit are definitely different I think it's pretty good but it's hard for me sup like that because it's so low in protein so unless I just had like protein and I need some carbs and fat I wouldn't really go for this bar but maybe if I were out hiking and I had a beef stick and then I had that that'd be a good combination it's good not to gingerbready I taste a little bit of spices so I think that they can classify as a gingerbread barb with a few spices but moving on we have a quest and I got this one and when it was on sale it's probably expired but I can feel it all broken up has four grams of net carbs so one cookie is 250 calories 17 fat 19 grams of carbs 11 which are fiber and 15 grams of protein let's go ahead and give this one a try already spilling it all right here's our work meth it's all broken up texture seems pretty boring doesn't smell good and it doesn't taste good it doesn't taste like anything yeah it tastes like crap like don't ever buy that literally it tastes like I don't even know just a really plain cake with no sugar and no and he started flavoring at all all right so out of the protein bars definitely the kick bites wins as long as you warm it up make sure you warm it up and then you may enjoy it so we're gonna move on to the ice cream before it melts so we have the halo top a gingerbread house so for 1/4 1/2 a cup 67 grams we have 3 and 1/2 grams of fat 17 carbs and 5 protein for and 90 calories per serving add some the other day it's nice and melty right now both that little gingerbread pieces inside right spoon in hand let's do and [Music] okay that is so good hallo top you nailed that flavor I know I tried it the other day but just trying and like thinking about what I'm actually trying that is so good it's a good nice I want to say like a vanilla ice cream with a ginger red hence world they're out and the little gingerbread pieces and it is so good it literally tastes like I'm eating a really good gingerbread cookie like a really good gingerbread cookie into ice cream so good alright let's keep this positive streak going now we've got a few more things but first next up let's go ahead and do this gingerbread little gourmet popcorn so this I believe is from world market so it is gluten free whole grain vegan or vegetarian friendly and for one cup 28 grams we have 110 calories two and half grams of fat 24 carbs 17 of which are sugar so if you worried about your sugar there's quite a bit of sugar and a serving and one gram of protein this is made in Salt Lake City Utah [Music] we're looking at okay that's really good um at first I was like this just tastes like caramel corn but then I got the gingerbread it has a gingerbread seasoning which are spices fat it's definitely a really really good popcorn I love gingerbread I love popcorn I love caramel the gingerbread caramel corn is a hit I definitely recommend going to get some again I think I got it from world market so go check it out if you've never been to a world market go there and you need at least an hour look around because there's lots of really cool things there and yeah you can find lots of treasures especially around holidays there's lots of like little gift ideas that are cute for stocking stuffers and whatnot alright last thing we have are these orange gingerbread cookies from Italy so about Tina sent me these as part of the holiday gift exchange box and I'm really excited to try them I love orange things that chocolate about gingerbread all of that so here's what the cookie looks like there's chocolate on the bottom [Music] that looks really good oh my gosh this is so good okay so have you hot if you've had in Milano cookie like the white cookie with the chocolate sliver on the middle between two little cookie crackers and the orange flavor ones that's what it tastes like but better and with hints of gingerbread like this is so good I'm really excited about this one oh my gosh I don't know if you guys can find them anywhere but they're really really good and I don't know her cookie this entire thing weighs 200 grams and there are six cookies so they must be 34 grams each so per 100 grams it's 9 grams of fat and we have 66 carbs and 5 grams of protein so about 22 grams of carbs 3 grams of fat and 1 and 1/2 gram of protein per cookie so yes that one is definitely really good the brand is favored inna glazed gingerbread oh my gosh you guys need to find some if you can and they're really really good I highly recommend them easily 10 out of 10 so easy 10 up to forget the protein cookies they are garbage get the real cookie enjoy yourself and Happy Holidays all right

have some proto this is the dunkaroo and it is so good check it out that's all this just came out of the freezer so it's frozen right now and then this one is the Cinnabon cinnamon Cinnabon there's actually like it's a normal in there so I'm just gonna have a half a serving total so like 1/4 of each of these and put it in the microwave because it turned into a cookie and I have my work station set up I'm doing client work the dogs are patiently waiting for some attention but I'm just organizing everything a planner and trying to get things done it's a nice day outside probably really hot per usual all right finally having breakfast it's almost noon so have my typical egg beaters with spinach shredded lettuce salsa sour cream actually this is a spinach kale Greek dip from Trader Joe's I highly highly recommend it so I have my oat bran right here volumes really go this is only like 18 grams of carbs and I have some spray butter sugar-free syrup and cocoa powder so I'm making the chocolate um oat bran and putting some s'mores if it butters on top this stuff is so good and starting today they offer free shipping on any orders over $49 so you guys need to try if you have not already totally recommend any of the flavors they're so good this is a s'mores peanut butter so it's just peanuts and there's some crunchy marshmallows in here and if you use th fit you will save on your order so support me save and enjoy promises so at the independence cake is literally the best one out there though the next day and I had a very similar breakfast but it was similar I'm going to hit the gym now I am off today I was gonna try and pick up a trip but I would be I'm illegal because it'd be seven days in a row so anyways I'm going to not even think about trying to work and the fact that I'm not picking up a trick and just going to do things around the house that I need to do but I'm going to the gym now it is 12:45 and I've got a lot of computer work done got my cardio done and yeah I'm going to try this rep sports reactor and this is the dragon fruit kind of not have this flavor so I'll let you guys know what I think I think there's a lot of caffeine in here so I might not have the entire thing I know that it's best to have the full dosages on all the other ingredients but I don't want to be bouncing off the walls and like now but I also had a rice cake because I'm getting a little hungry and finishing my built fire which I started earlier so I had about two-thirds of this bill about earlier and then I had my typical eggs spinach and then I had some oats with cocoa powder so they're like chocolates but I have my hydrogen with BCAAs and salt in here because salt is needed when you're all the time and especially when you're working out especially near sweating so got some salts PCI's and I've got swap pinch Ted's and leg accessories today so I don't know if I'm missing anything maybe I'll bring you guys with me we'll see all right I'll see you the next [Music] my world of make-believe kids screaming the creator's profanities ice ice conversion cus the ones of my car so much [Music] [Music] [Music] why can you just let me eat my weight my world of make-believe kids both fair ladies Sundays I'm skinny I have some 96 ground beef and English muffin with spray butter and I'll probably have something else that for this because this is not too much and I am hungry are you hungry too why'd you throw Betty Oh update the reactor is so good in the dragon fruit highly highly recommend that flavor is freaking amazing it's sweet and I don't know it just goes down really well it's dead it dissolves really well so it's not like clumpy or like the crystal you were never highly recommend it I was not tingly and I didn't feel like sick or anything like that I had pretty good lift so I would say it's almost it's 4:00 p.m. right now so I've only had breakfast so I was getting pretty exhausted halfway through my workout when I was like on bench and I go hey this sucks but alright like I said I just ate a little bit ago but I'm gonna have some fit butters butterscotch toffee crunch so good this is a peanut butter blend I need to mix it up a little bit but here are the macros so I'm gonna just gonna have one tablespoon and I will put it on a rice cake and then on the top of the lid it shows what protein it is made from so that's pretty freaking cool but I'm gonna have this and then run to the store I need a few things like dry shampoo to get through life all right I was just about to leave to run my errands but we've got mail dive bar nutrition I'm trying out some new protein bars a new company I guess they're not new and then we have the Joe palace I'm so excited so I'm gonna show you guys what's inside and then I'm gonna run my errands and then I'm probably going to try all this stuff later so make sure you are following me on no fit chick and check out my awesome reviews alright so I got four different kinds so actually ordered three but then I ordered some scraps I didn't really know what I was ordering but it's just all kinds different Joe mixed in anyways that's pretty cool that was like as I think in these are 13 14 15 ish so blue velvet Giavotella half-baked proto and that looks pretty cool this one is Uncle Sam's America I don't really know what any of these are and I was a scrap I mean this one is wet in the Fox red velvet PB Oreo so oily and that's a bummer that it takes off the label it's the only downfall like look how oily this is so anyways these are freaking amazing and there's a huge launch last week so that's what I got these from they sold out in like 20 minutes so you guys have to put the notifications on and it's on Etsy so that's where I get it she actually has a store in New Jersey as well there we are alright here is a look inside and so they all have like this particular smell to them and taste I don't really know what it is these are so oily they're slipping all over but as you see they are freakin amazing they look amazing but yeah like I said there's some particular taste I don't know what is what it is in it but they're really good it's kind of like a frosting cookie dough it's really fluffy they're kind of warm right now so they shouldn't be like this but they're still good when you have when you get it like right away it's kind of warm you can also make cookies out of them and the microwave air fryer oven whatever you want but I do recommend it I don't know if the macros are legit but if you're not in prep it should be okay alright next up we have the dive bar nutrition protein bars and right here it just shows that they should be a pretty legit bar it's like cookie cookie don't like so here are all the flavors I got I got 22 bars and they actually have caffeine in them too I think that there are some on their website that don't have caffeine good amount of fiber not too much fiber that's going to do some damage but should be a pretty good amount of fiber I would stick with like a half a bar just to be safe and just see how your body responds but anyways we have peanut butter a chocolate chip churro Gerald I don't know what that is a chocolate chip cookie though trash can cookie s'mores all this and s'mores cookies and dreams divorce cake guessing like a wedding cake dump truck brownie salted caramel pretzel and we have like bunny crap or something like that I figured it was called anyways I'll be trying these and let you know what I think but its estimate on the macros like 200 some calories so we've got 240 calories 6 grams of fat 30 carbs and 16 protein but not too much sugar and there's some the ingredients of course there's almond butter I hope they don't all have almond butter because I'm try not to have any almonds right now since I'm allergic to almonds see what this guy has almond butter so I'm guessing they're probably all almond butter but anyways I'll try a little bit I'll let you know anything make sure to check out Doh fit chick and they'll be all on there alright I just got done and doing 6 reviews it took forever but I tried 3 of the dive bar nutrition bars so stay tuned see what I think about them I like them but I'm not too sure so anyways make sure to follow Joe fat check and you'll see the full reviews plus I've done all of the bodybuilding signature Crunch Bars now so these will all be up in the next few days on my Instagram page alright it is salad production time so every single night I've been having a big salad so I start with half a bag of spinach and then I just break it up with my hands I guess and then I'm going to add half of this garden salad so stay tuned for the next step all right so this huge bowl is already pretty much full of spinach and lettuce and I'm going to chop up a half a cucumber put in there and then my tomatoes so I usually have about this many tomatoes and I'll just chop those up as well and onto the next step all right there we go and I'm going to add the dressings and mix it up and then the rest of the toppings so Aldi actually carries this reduced-fat crumbled feta and I've been adding that to my salad as well so here are the macros 2 grams of fat 1/2 gram of chair so I have 1/2 gram of fat 2 games of carbs and then protein we're 6 grams of protein so this stuff is really good for the macros and getting some extra protein and plus all the prices you cannot beat them I am going to top tonight's salad with this spinach and kale Greek yogurt dip from Trader Joe's so it's either this or guacamole and I didn't get the guacamole so this stuff is so so good I highly recommend it and then we're gonna have some plain Greek yogurt I'm going to put 70 grams on there so much more protein and some salsa so just the food lion kind medium chunky salsa and I will do some Lowry's using salt for the seasonings and stay tuned alright here is the final product but this is actually before I put my eggs on it so I just made some scrambled eggs and I usually put that on there if I'm name smart protein so here's the entire salad before it's mixed in I'm just going to add that and some flowery seasoning salt and the 1 Appetit but that's it guys that's all I have for the night so I'm gonna eat this and watch the imposters which I'm loving I don't know why they aren't getting their food but I highly recommend the imposters and making big bomb salads I would put some blueberries on top if you didn't see that blueberries and croutons and cilantro all right today is another filming day for YouTube this is the first time I talked to this it's weird to hear your voice so I've got my coffee I'm editing YouTube videos that are old so hopefully you guys cuz these better be up ASAP but I just decided that I'm going to start marking my calendar with these little acute stickers whenever I do my cardio cuz sometimes I get lost and forget when I do my like how many days I've done my cardio and I'm at four days a week now so hopefully this will help me I am the worst at using a planner so if anyone has any tips on being successful with a planner and organizing all that please help me I need all the help about tea my breakfast but do we have a delivery raise and I'm so excited I love their packaging so all of like the G pop and raise it's freakin badass packaging but here's my food we've got typical eggs should go spinach plain Greek yogurt salsa and seasonings and then I've got oatmeal with some eggs cooked in Swiss a little thicker and I have Rory's cookie monster madness fit butters just one third of a serving and then some sugar-free jelly from the UK dogs just ate their eggs as well hello I am coming at you from the kool-aid not that car but the coded place to go get drive up tested I have an appointment 12 minutes do so I'm just waiting for him to call me now I I'm kind of nervous if it's like the nose thing because that I hear it hurts some people I don't know anyways I will let you guys know what I think afterwards so stay tuned on the whole cloven thing I don't think I said it to you guys but Monday I got a call from the Colvin team with my work and I worked with someone who who now has tested positive for koban so I meant unable to fly through the eleven so yeah it's really annoying because this is maybe off and if I had trips I'd be pay protected but I'm off anyway so I'm like this is so pointless like that's my luck the timing is just you know perfect whatever but anyways I'm gonna go get tested and then run some errands per usual and that's it got my friends coming to town tomorrow so I really hope that I don't have coated because I'd feel like a terrible person so I'm sorry to anyone watching this who is mad at me right now but they've been planning on coming for a long time and we're gonna go to Charleston for the weekend so that'll be on another YouTube video that we are going to Charleston for the weekend go to the beach and I'm just going to have a nice stress-free weekend so I'm excited for that but I'll see you guys in the next clip and let you know how this testing went ok so I just got done and it really wasn't that bad she literally just came to the window gave me a q-tip and I swabbed my own nose each nose hole and then she put in the test tube she said I'm quarantined for 10 days and I will hear back in three to seven business days so yeah it wasn't bad they don't stick they didn't notice anymore they have you do it as far as you're comfortable with but anyways um that's that all right so I just creepily drove to my new gym which is right over there so I'm going to be going to be cold in Huntersville that is where I am sponsored that one and the Gold team of Charlotte I believe which is in the epicenter and uptown not downtown so yeah I

the flavors there's 10 and they are all phenomenal well I can't say all but I can say all I have not tried me up but I know that they will be awesome as well all right so I am craving a sweets like no other so I'm having one of my skinny sweets this is the cookie dough bite my ordered a bunch of stuff from skinny sweets and I used Jackie's code I don't know I think it's JC q you a I don't know for sure but you can find out her on Instagram just go to skinny sweets Instagram page and she posts on there as well so I've been reviewing some of the products and my favorite so far is the banana chocolate chip cookie it's really really good not a fan of the lemon poppy seed muffins I love lemon poppy seed they're very dry and they're not very sweet I think they're discontinued right now though it was like a spring thing the banana bread is pretty good it's more like a Irie type bread texture it's not like you're dense bread that you'd want so I think that if I put it in an air fryer slice it up and put some spray butter on it I think it'd be a lot better but overall it was pretty good the dark chocolate orange brownie was pretty good again it was pretty it was kind of dry it's hard to make things that are protein healthy sweet treats my nut and not make them dry so I understand that but the cookie it was a very doughy and delicious go check out my dough fetch it doe that check page to see the review but this isn't bad it's nice a sweet it's a nice little sweet treat so it's going to hold me over for 10 minutes I think I'm gonna try and make a recipe once I get some client emails done a girl I follow on Instagram I think it's Lauren fit foodie I think that's who I'm making her recipe for cinnamon rolls they looked freaking bomb so good so I hope I have all the ingredients I think I do but stay tuned that's it's gonna be a next all right here is everything you need to make protein cinnamon rolls I am so excited and here's different protein powders so them using she uses cake pop and her so I'm gonna use some and then when my favorite is build fast formula vanilla ice cream some of the best vanilla tasting protein powder I've ever tried and then I also have some of my quest protein cinnamon crunch I figured that'd be nice to add to cinnamon rolls and then I'm using some butter extract vanilla extract this is my sweetener of choice cinnamon spray butter because I don't have any other butter and then light cream cheese and they also have this brown sugar and Sun and I figured I can add some not maybe as well and we have some instant baking yeast and I'm using gluten-free flour stay tuned all right my sweet obsession right now continuous this is a banana chocolate chip cookie there are the macros I put in the microwave for like 20 seconds and to bring this one hand one-handed that's really hot it's really good alright I'm gonna enjoy this and I'm gonna continue my recipe not my recipe but baking all right guys I just took them out of the oven some are a little bit taller than the others here at the ends but overall I think they look pretty good the recipe is supposed to be for eight but I made a bunch of mini ones instead so we will see what they look like with the cream cheese and how they taste all right here they are and now it's time to do the taste test it's so excited alright so the overall result I think they would be really good but i overcooked them but if I add some spray butter inside then it's actually not bad at all they just need to be not so like dry and the butter actually helps quite a bit alright this is what is about to go down I take my salads very seriously so I have spinach and then I have some of the salad kits to add to it it was on sale that's the only reason I got it and then these nice crunchy things that came inside of it I'm gonna use ham for my protein got cucumbers tomatoes and croutons I love croutons I can literally just eat croutons all day and then I have these like mini all the oil type things that I got from like Italy or something last year I don't know I just opened them like last month and I'm gonna add some green beans because you guys know I'm the green bean Queen and I'm going to have some carrots and this I got from Aldi the other day I'm gonna have this on the side it is really really good and along with this light ranch it's pretty darn good too for being a light version I guess and then my dressings so this is not really dressing it's just teriyaki but it tastes really good and then I am obsessed with this sweet vinaigrette super good G Hughes is where it's at you guys need to try if you have not already they have tons of different products and you get that at Walmart I'm sure other places but I know Walmart for sure and I'm but on a great kick lately so I'm just gonna have a few crepes I love like the dark crepes the best like the black I guess and I'm also craving some jello so anyways I'll show you guys the final product alright here is the final product I've read that I also put blueberries and raspberries in here or I like to so I added that as well but I'm gonna eat this now and relax for the night because I have been on the go non-stop all right so I have literally been the worst I did not finish my video the other night I finished my food with macro snacks I believe I had the churro logo and then I had some G pop popcorn so that's we headed to my Night Watch the wait no I don't have G pop I had ate me guilt-free a pumpkin spice brownie pumpkin spice is really good a lot of the other brownies are kind of dry but that one is actually like soft and hey tears above moist that one is way more compared to the rest so anyways I just wanted to end this video I got a huge box in the mail filled with all kinds of goodies that I ordered from net trician calm um so I'll just I'm gonna open it and then I'll show you guys what I have inside and that's gonna be it so I think here eyes so much for watching give this video a thumbs up I'm getting back in my game I'm a few days later than whenever I recorded it left but I'm back in my game and I hope to continue to bring out more content so stay tuned alright here's everything I got don't mind my dogs eating their food in the background but make sure you are following me on instagram doe fit chick and check out my reviews and I just reviewed these marshmallows cinnamon toast marshmallows and a side note I'm doing giveaway macro snacks right now and I'm going through all of my snacks I have got a box full of snacks and then these are all protein bars the ones in baggies I've done reviews on so I should probably eat them or throw them but anyways and I have a little over two hundred dollars worth of stuff coming from the UK so I've got to get to work [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "VpMpblAm-Nc": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "UozGXNcA-jA": "[Music] the presence of chocolate in the vial can interfere with our ability to accurately test the amount of THC in that product [Music] [Music] this science is important to establish the scientific legitimacy of the cannabis industry in its nascent days [Music]", "U4RQgj3KnrA": "[Music] oh hey so how's it going everybody um basically I have wanted to shoot some edible videos for a while I had one go up on the channel that was my first time ever well first and only time ever making my own edibles making that can of butter that was super City [Music] I had a really good time with that those edibles well just put me straight to sleep it was actually really nice though it was like why not the highest I've ever been but I haven't had a high like that in a while it was just like total like it was awesome everything's warm and basically I've had some edibles since then I've had the Korova [ __ ] 500 milligram and thousand milligram bars before not a whole thing at a time but those are crazy because even a little chunk would put me straight under and what would happen was basically would eat them and then be like well I guess that tasted pretty good and like an hour would go by and that really happens we're just kind of talking and then all of a sudden it's like oh god what is this it's just like all of a sudden who's like sleeping both like basically that stage you're at like right before you fall asleep or you're like just slipping around like right before you yeah so that was really lit but it's been so long but I couldn't even find the footage from that so I'm like [ __ ] I need to just do this edibles video because I yeah I don't even have that anymore like I do but I can't find it so is whatever but maybe one day you'll see some footage of these five hundred and thousand milligram edibles so in the meantime here at the Kerr MoMA I do have these Kiva chocolate bars and some [ __ ] and orange zest mints so edibles are on some a whole other level right now we took one of these milk chocolate keepa bars and then just stuck it in between a couple big-ass chocolate chip cookies so just got back from dope-ass shoot some chocolate and this is the first thing I ever learned to bake in my dad at the fishing growing up so it's very special to me and every time I bake up we shot a video for a baker person gonna go get some new gear at the thrift store get that on the market I'm really hyped for those edibles oh yeah UV also she gave us some free cookies they're like vegan us stuff like honestly best cookies ever day they're pretty bomb yeah [Music] and that was really good uh it was a little sweet but that was so so good because these are the 60 milligram ones not as bad you can see that when you buy it they come in the super nice packaging like Paul makes you feel nice inside good ass ingredients if you pull it out test thank you for choosing Kiva and then it's got these 15 milligram already pre broken out chunks we're not pretty broken out but like basically it's kind of like measured so you know where the seam is if you cracked it there that is exactly 15 milligrams like right here and then the actual packaging has like the squares on it so you can stick it right on there it's real size and then you can break it into different chunks and kind of eyeball how much you're getting because of the picture there so then on top of this there's another diagonal slit so I'm going to eat this seven point five milligrams here oh my god me does show boom I live all in the dark chocolate I guess you can taste it a little bit more but it's honestly like that better Wow cuz a milk chocolate can't even really taste the butt at all but right now my sweet butt or my taste buds haven't really been tasting as much sweet stuff lately so I do like this dark chocolate one it's just like this barely little hint of the weed taste and that's really nice so um I guess I could get more into like review we've type nests but these are just lit like I can't really say anything too specifically about the edible hi is just really nice it's like being baked definitely on the sleepier in the cut type side of being baked though um just chill accent so that's really lit and then on top of that I've never actually had one of these mints before it says THC infused awakening limits orange zest so there's 60 milligrams or 160 milligrams on this pack so I mean 16 minutes because 10 milligram hints which comes out in the super nice packaging and then you go and then they pop out like gum or like mints just like popping through here and um yeah so Cheers here goes I kind of cracked this one when I pushed it out but hmm and says put underneath your tongue so that's really interesting um definitely doesn't taste bad with weed I think lower dose edibles nah I'm not gonna I don't know I was gonna say maybe the way to go just whenever I do a lot of edibles I just fall asleep it's like not bad it's a really nice like sleep and really deep and everything but if you want to be enjoying it I think um I'm the lower doses well then you also don't feel this one I don't know basically edibles are lit though just so discreet so you can even do it in public and I think [ __ ] oh my god Wow I could have really so many different edible videos because I forgot yeah I was at the Denver mall in LoDo drinking my weed soda in public that was pretty lit I might throw up some footage of that if I can find it but on that edible I was smoking so much but in Denver that I didn't even feel anything off that 50-milligram edible so yeah I don't okay yeah that is that does actually taste kind of strong um on the mint here I think I like the chocolate better cuz the mints so small they gotta like condense that but that's pretty much already dissolved so uh oh also Wow actually yeah cuz in my head I kept thinking well I haven't really had that much edibles not you know enough to make a video or anything I've actually had quite a lot of edibles since that last one well and it's been lips so I think another one I had was 100 and milligram lollipops so I've had these a few times SuperDuper lip denry and I hit up the thrift store the other day to get some stumble on clothes we going and you just popped in a 100 milligram lollipops walking around the thrift store no problem we also went to Minneapolis with them and that was lit but I think that's what I got a safer edibles I hope you enjoyed watching this video like it's just been lit I mean like before last year I just don't even know there'd be she like just like mints you know delicious s milk chocolate lollipops whole new world here and soda too [ __ ] is crazy so hope you enjoyed watching us and uh yeah check you later hopefully these kicking a little bit later I'll be feeling pretty lit but [Music]", "PxM_ZOm5Xtk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I wanna show us my morning coffee I've been obsessed with I have the Starbucks program Milka this is limited edition you might be able to find some stuff I know at Target hyvee a few other places I will add a little bit of my special dark cocoa powder and then I actually ordered these off of Amazon I definitely recommend that pepper mocha and the salted caramel are the best of equal flavors and I will maybe add a little bit of this as well peppermint cookie the stevia this is from Amazon I absolutely love this and I take it with me wherever I travel and then if I want a white chocolate so this is the white chocolate I added a little bit of my peppermint in here as well but it's almost gone and I'm going to put in some almond milk to make it more like a latte and I will top it with some chocolate peppermint whipped foam and if I'm feeling a little crazy I will sprinkle some of my Trader Joe's peppermint meringues or marshmallows or whipped cream or all of the above so there you have it I'll show you the final product so I'm actually trying to finish this book I'm reading

sampler back then I found them on sale for $10 on the Amazon purchase two more boxes or purchase one box per just to mark so I really liked them and then I just checked it I think they're like $16 now

I'm so about 7:10 and today I'm back with another video today's video is gonna be a edible mukbang and I thought the perfect way to start out an edible mukbang it's with the drinks so I actually have one for Skye and one for myself I'm gonna take the blue Rhys and I'm gonna pour her up the Tigers blood she's like upstairs chilling and she had somebody go like scroll up a blonde you know I'm gonna just start eating all my edibles but just thought I'd introduce these syrups because they don't have a label they just have the flavor on them I got them from a really nice guy the other day he runs a company I think it's called like power nap or something I actually have to get the the name of their company I just know they're not too big online and they're not too big on like anything so he was one of me to try the serum so I think this is a really cool looking syrup so far it doesn't look too liquidy but we'll see when we pour it out I just thought I'd say it like you know before everybody's like what kind of soup is that okay I don't know but looks fire so we're gonna try it out don't want so in senior you okay but take two on that sky look we just came downstairs to like make some food or whatever and like hot that she's seen that whole freaking thing but it's all good blue raspberry here we go for a random guy this guy knows how to [ __ ] package something what the [ __ ] it's childproof possible so far that looks fire at the bottom you can't really see it's so blue we can but you can't just looks thick oh I'm scared to open this back up I can feel it like carbonating a [ __ ] and when I open this back up it's gonna explode I promise you that it's just making me nervous you got to take it slow I don't really use that much I'll use like you know there's a 4 ounce bottle can you see it I'm gonna pour them up I need to stop getting so excited with this [ __ ] I'm gonna pour the whole bottle in here though I'm gonna put all of it in when I can fit it in it's gonna be some of the best stuff I've had so far because every single syrup so far you could taste like a really thick thing or like you taste like weed in your mouth this is really good it's actually really really good I like it a lot how much is left in here literally 1 ounce exactly is left whoa is he getting I didn't wake up you're supposed to mix that up man that wasn't a bad taste I just didn't like that looks like one of those like lava lamps when he makes it around cause it's so syrupy it's like real I think I don't know if they made this way additionally I don't think he made this with dissolute man cuz like that I've had this bottle for a while and usually when you make series of dis wit it like looks like a ring around like the whole bottle like wherever its it's if it's like filled up to here it'll leave a bottle like a ring around the bottle of dishw it like right where it sits like this this didn't do that and it's not mixing like dis will it would normally dissolute would sit at the top of the bottle this is actually really cool I don't know what he made it with I need to find that guy now I need to go find sky and give her hers we should look far I just go upstairs and I'll say I should have put this [ __ ] over some ice he's amazing I mixed up skies by the way where's yours and she already started drinking her rosary these were up the stairs yeah quench your thirst I like that one [ __ ] you I got a bag of goodies here I'm gonna start off with yes actually no this is so heavy on my stomach I actually just ate some pizza so I don't know why I decided to do this after I just ate I don't know but all right so you know what let's start off with something light I got these myths they're Kiva petra minced for petra means compliments of Kiva confections this says they're two point five milligrams each and there's four in here so two points like two two four six a there's like ten milligrams what a minute to use [ __ ] it smells like toothpaste eat them all video because I'm not really a fan of mint but it's interesting that was interesting here's my decrepit bag of goodies and I hold us all the magic in here so I have some three heads company sharks these are gummy sharks 50 milligrams each so there's 500 total in the bag that means it's par like what like 10/10 in there or something I float there's more than ten it looks like a lot more than 10 so prime more than 500 milligrams are there this is also for three heads it says sugar-free butterflies 50 milligrams each so 500 total in the bag sugar-free butterflies that actually really intrigued me what do these taste like sugar free gummies do get a say they smell like ganja's oh man I taste like weed dude knocking on front these look dirty but that's the weed on it I'm gonna eat them all don't try one whips by eight two three four five six there was turning the bags they do it kind of dirty those are that oil oh wow no way I want to like it mm-hmm it's so we dude it's such a weed these are chewy yep I'd really joke yeah sure you just felt like all those amounts to serve us anymore I should go you could live I got two of green ones in a pink very nice I'm sure ate them separately shoot they've different flavors I don't know I feel like at this point they all seems like you don't chew in the butterflies [Music] don't run with these don't really taste like we I can see the weed all over the bag they're good right these I feel like these like don't taste like as much weed but I thought they're gonna get me more [ __ ] up I feel like the other ones were sugar-free and that's why it looks so dirty like the weed because if I didn't have much to stick to like though like the weed and stuff but this has so much sugar just like the we can stick to it all over it everywhere there's like the sneaky ones [ __ ] you up it seems so good like real candy smack you these are really really like the texture is more slimy hip the truth is even more well this is so fun there's 500 milligrams in this bag there's 500 milligrams and the other bag that's Kathryn milligrams but I gave Scott - so it's like 900 milligrams I've adjusted damn near 900 milligrams

some type of nausea I got one mo up there's really we all over my bed last baby shark and now I have well okay now I have excuse me the nerds from boss-lady products these are medicated nurse um I'm not too sure how many milligrams I want to say like 500 milligrams 300 to 500 milligram I know it's like somewhere in the hundreds it's not like in a thousand anything but these are these it's child to man oh okay oh good thing I'm gonna dull I see them these are the I think the cherry ones the wild cherry or just regular cherry it's from infinite extracts it's like a gummy it says 150 milligrams THC a space domain hmm gelatin sugar corn syrup citric acid citric acid [ __ ] me up guys just so you know I'm not really supposed to eat a lot of citric acid by doing anyway malic acid coconut oil THC doctor who's like five ingredients I'm not allergic to anything in case you guys are read the ingredients some edibles don't have ingredients though this one does so I thought it was important to read it it doesn't have a flavor but I could smell it great album even those I feels like I'm biting into human skin I'm biting through a an arm like a stomach a shovel there mmm but tastes like a tongue mmm green apple tongue these are the truth after I'm done like with most of these nerds I can move on to the baked goods I just don't want to like be eating a [ __ ] brownie and then switch over to the lyrics that's kind of gross I think the stuff that makes this edible is the white stuff on it mmm this is this buff I try with a myth you like minty and sweet that's the one I already ate [Music] Wonderman milligrams are having my mouth spa that's all half a minute - nurse posh lady makes all types of different like flavors of Denver's she does like like over 10 flavors I think like a lot of different flavors an infinite extracts they have like I only seen two different flavors of these gummies but they're really really good I actually think who's gonna be as good as it was if they're the three heads company they have amazing edibles I think no matter what gummy you get it's always gonna be bomb but they have tons they have watermelon ones and they have like a million different baked goods doing like they make them so oh no all these edibles are pretty official actually I had our own edible bacon and that was from blazing edibles but I took a bite of it and like I don't even know what happened to it and then I also had but yeah I also had um some what it was a corn bread and like I don't know it was like a like a banana bread type thing and that was from be healthy and that was another edible that was fire because I got to build mighty little bread loaves and then it came with like this this like churned like whipped edible butter it was so good but I actually kept it in my bag by accident and it went bad so I didn't get to like eat those on camera I had a lot more edibles than this just edibles you know they're perishable and a lot of mine

milligrams so last time I had these popcorns it's like their flavor didn't [ __ ] and I have like these yellow ones and those were like banana so I'm guessing that there's like a strawberry blueberry digging happening here these aren't yellow these are like a tan so I wouldn't be surprised if they're not just regular popcorns and there's like some type of weird flavor but it always smacks yep with some type of weird flavor the blue one is I don't know I don't know what any of these are I don't know what the flavors are with a [ __ ] bomb let's play how fast can I eat the whole bag [Music] I

inside nothing too new if you guys have been following my channel and watched the last couple of videos um but yes i'm gonna show you guys what's inside um my lift literally took three and a half hours it was just a squat pinch deadlift day working up to my openers so exactly as my meat day would be for warm-ups all of the weight wraps sets and all of that worked up to my openers and i had three sets of one wrap up all my openers so that's what you saw i think i don't remember what i filmed but i'm about to eat i've only had breakfast and it's 5 15 p.m i did have some toy story gummies during my workout um and that's about it so um i'm gonna eat asap and maybe take the dogs for a walk before it storms it looks like it's gonna storm any second now and if you guys know my luck i tend to go for walks right when it starts to rain so um i'm gonna show you guys what's inside though i got more proto just because i'm totally obsessed and this is the golden oreo this one is the cookies and cream and i don't remember what this one is the old glory um i don't remember what exactly that is but i'll show you guys the insides i also got the sweatshirt body by proto um it's only five dollars so i'm like uh yeah why not super cute well i mean it's just basic but i like it so i'm going to show you guys what these look like when i get the lids off and like i said before in my last video they're kind of oily i just wiped them off with a paper towel they were very oily but i do recommend it you can get it on instagram just search proto and there's an example of the macros so not too bad i don't know if you can see that 20 something carbs but yes the oil actually gets them like it comes off so that's a bummer but you can google or like search in myfitnesspal for most of these and find it this is so delicious it's so good um this one obviously has golden oreos in it um they all taste they have a very similar taste to them i don't really know what it is like i said before but it's very like fluffy frosting type like so it's like a frosting dough um but it changes consistencies if it's like in the fridge so this is has been traveling in the usps mail truck and sitting on my porch for like an hour at least um so it's like room temperature fluffiness if you have in the fridge it's different freezer it's different i usually keep mine in my freezer and then put them in the microwave for 30 seconds to make like a cookie doughy cookie so do whatever you want that there's it's so versatile um but i love it and i don't really know what this one is exactly there's like little strips of frosting stuff in it and then cookies and cream is obviously cookies and cream but i do recommend trying it um so that's awesome and then twisted dough twisted cookie dough is way different um i'm with twisted cookie dough so i definitely recommend recommend them as well my code is chv if you want to order there's no codes for proto and it's a little more expensive but um they're all really good they're all different so you cannot really compare them exactly um there's a lot of cookie doughs out there i did try 10 different cookie doughs on dough fit chick so check it all out but i'm going to try and take the dogs for a quick little stroll because it looks like it's moving in quick time for a meal i've got some toast some yellow squash and chicken from aldi this is southwest it's really good and then i have some white chocolate peanut butter cup all-american butter um it's american dream now on my toast it's super good if you guys are interested in trying out this brand my code is chfit per usual it's the american dream better now so i just got done doing a bunch of reviews of the dive bar protein bar let me know if you guys have tried it i don't really know what i think about them um i've tried probably 12 of their flavors now and there's only like three that i really like two that i really like and then like two others that i like they just have such a weird taste and like a super super strong chemical sweetener taste um i don't know what exactly it is i mean they're made with like stevia but i have stevia all the time maybe it's just stevia overkill but it's like strong i had to throw a few of the bars away i'm like i cannot do this but anyways i just reviewed all of them so they are ready to go up on don't fit chicks make sure you check them out so you can see which bars are good i know there's a few others that i have not yet tried that they are for sale i was going to place an order today because i have much for sale but honestly i don't think it's worth it i don't think i'll be buying them again plus they never share or say thank you to anything that i post or anything like that so to me that customer service is not good but it is a little after 8 pm i think i'm gonna take the dogs for another stroll um i don't think it's raining right now and they are super antsy so gotta do that and i will catch in with you guys later or tomorrow we'll see it's so hot outside this should be illegal it's just hot and humid and blah right buddy just got done with the gym i don't even think i supposed to live today but i just wanted to go in there and do something since my high carb day yesterday and today actually dropped 0.2 pounds so i am i don't know under my weight that i have to be at least um but i'm expecting a package today and it's not here i don't know where it is i was really hoping that that's what it was all right i'm going to show you guys i'm going to do the taste test of the wookie and i'm so excited so jack's just found a bug um stay tuned so i won a giveaway this week from wolfy's waffle queen wookies um i am going to be trying it now and you can check her out on instagram she is so cute she makes awesome looking treats so i got the christmas in july and then she gave me also these caramel i literally cannot talk total wookie bites caramel turtle lookie bites i'm pathetic guys um here is the christmas in july so i'm going to try a few different ways regular microwaved and airfryer maybe so stay tuned here is the inside and this up and close look at it and i'm ready to try it now i'm so hungry all right i've got it warmed up one piece warmed up and then one piece regular i'm going to give it a try i'll do the regular one first it smells very gingerbready i love gingerbread it smells really good and there's like little chips in here of some sort i don't really know what they are i'll have to look at the label coffee chips maybe it tastes like gingerbread christmas cookie batter like gingerbread sugar cookie combined so the bottom is actually kind of crunchy because the waffle so the waffle part on the bottom it's like a different layer and it has a crunch to it that was really fun all right i'm going to try the warmed up part i think i've warmed up a little bit too much i didn't realize that the waffle layer is different on the bottom so part of it got a little burnt so i got that part off but it smells even more strong and it's really warm so make sure you warm it up for like five to ten seconds go very very minimal that is really good warmed up i guess it's like it adds more of a crunch to the bottom and then it kind of tastes like it's fresh baked out of the oven i don't have anything else to say besides it's freaking good it is so good and like i said the texture is more doughy on the inside and then there's a waffle and crispy layer on the bottom so that's really cool and unique you can see that see waffle and the doughiness kind of it's just like a tad doughy but it's just like the perfect amount you can see more on that one i think but oh my gosh it's so good so definitely i recommend ordering some of the wookies super fun cool unique and very tasty this stuff from trader joe's is so so good i highly recommend trying it and the macros are pretty bomb i've got a typical bro style meal after that cookie i needed some i don't have too much the cookie though but um i've got my 96 lean ground beef potato medley i don't know what you call these they're babies and green beans everything has flowers and we've got some spray butter on the green beans happy sunday morning from these lazy pups i am just over here doing computer work writing programming for my clients having some coffee and i'm about to have some pb and j twisted dough here are the macros so pretty good for the pb j and this is what it's looking like so there's like little bits of jelly in there [Applause] clearly you can't see very much because i've taken like the jelly parts off but it's really good it's definitely in my top five i think um check out doe fit chick i've updated my top rankings of the 15 or 17 that i've tried i don't remember but anyways i'm gonna have a little bit of this finished computer work and i am on call today how do you feel about that no not on call airport standby 12 45 until 6 45 so stay tuned [Music]", "8nkDtAT6C-M": "[Music]

[Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "MNsF_JoJ4q8": "[Music] hello and welcome to another video so things gonna be a little different I first of all have a guest star here today so don't mind us we flew in from the red-eye overnight us tonight from Vegas so we're a little on the sleepy side but good news is we are going to do a fun video of doing a protein bar help so we're gonna show you guys see best in the worst protein bars we have 19 bars in France to try out so stay tuned and enjoy the ride any last words just wish us good luck oh not too much fiber anyways we have I have a coconut drink you trying to wash it down and we'll flavor is yours strawberry lemonade with a little hint of little extras gotta make things a little more interesting alright so stay tuned and we're gonna get this finalized and set up here we go [Music] so first we have the met-rx peanut butter cup and the pink creamy peanut butter supposedly he think it is the best one this is one of the best protein bars so which I'm sure check it out and save the best for last I feel like it's kind of flavorless really bland yeah not even good chocolate or peanut butter flavor [Music] [Music] I wouldn't buy it again unless I was like starving had to have that you only oh yeah the arc bar I would definitely buy that again probably like a seven out of it then I'm gonna let you do the reading I'm just here for the tasting this is what you don't have be able to write a tune you do protein pasting it's not that they're non-gmo soy beef free gluten free no sugar added non-dairy so it's supposed to be like healthy healthier than all the other ones so we'll see how it stands up so the note how supposedly the worst and then the best [Music] the texture of this - don't call it tacky luck without really taught me without like the sticky [Music] [Music] it's off like I want more than one note and that's just probably dry and your mouth that's so good and I'm gonna pick like powdery yeah three out of ten I like some of the quest bars but not this one and then you know how I don't I feel like a six out of the ten six and five maybe because the flavor is there but a texture is just kind of weird oh yeah I think I preferred like quest texture and flavor yeah if there was a combination of the two everything be like yeah I'm not perfect that's a lot closer just again not solid protein bars yeah all right best indie level one first for my salted caramel I'm so excited to try this one because everyone said that's so amazing those first four bars in general and then we're comparing it with one brand peanut butter chocolate cake I suppose one of the worst ones [Music] I mean a lot of women [Music] all right I can see why those are so addicting and because of delicious flavor all right now this is one bar peanut butter chocolate cake excited in terms of one bars so it's definitely better than the last money tasted okay so I like that one I usually don't think that I like one bar I said I think the chocolate top kind of helps so that's supposedly one of the worst ones and I don't know like a it's like a out of the ten I would definitely buy it the best or the worst [Music] [Music] there's not much sugar [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and then throw in there the pure protein chocolate supposedly that's one of the worst ones one of the worst so one thing about the built fires have heard that they're better in the freezer or the fridge [Music] enjoy Oh this means smell holy like enjoy worse pure protein [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I definitely put it up there but I would [Music] [Music] at least applicants were looking - yeah like someone gotten it from their 1992 Halloween bag the coconut flavor is weird that's all I can say better coconut flavor than the pure protein though I think to be your personally real name is better yeah I don't know why this coconut flavor actually like just tastes really really really really [Music] and then help people and say that one bars or the worst and okay built back supposedly one of the best new protein bars out there really low carb and [Music] I like the Ronnie Coleman Signature Series [Music] it's good radical I just actually give me a thumbs up of texture [Music] okay [Music] [Music] so far it supposedly the prosperity burst occurred in my quest birthday cake specifically what of course I like it way better than the question peanut butter differently it's much sweeter has more flavor to it but impurity and Ronnie Coleman big declare like vanilla yogurt this is that [Music] [Music] I've never won anything like that my god Oh Megan [Music] I got raspberry flavor yeah you're right birthday cake I don't know what is this okay you're right delicious birthday cake play with a raspberry caramel layer wrapped in white chocolate coating sprinkles with sweeteners with sweeteners no you have to have a heart compare so we have that one I mean another we've heard I've won [Music] all the time they're so good airy light stuck there are so many calories I really enjoy them I try and save my macros but way different I think I might like this one better [Music] yeah me too don't forfeit as what we're like flavor and sure yeah I like variety rather just like chocolate chocolate [Music] max delivers a lot people say these are the worst person in the world I try to no count first because one of us doesn't it smell good it's not like play-doh or something smells like layup cardboard play-doh [Music] your whole mouth just get to cover it in like sleepy like does example I feel about the other one haha that was the powdery one yeah good ingredients like it's sweetened with monkford stevia extract there's a risk the trial actually had to but I don't know [Music] all right Emery bar these are supposedly pretty good as well so let's bomb yeah aftertaste use a little better it does not taste like blueberry I taste a hand in blueberry but I just feel like it's and I'm speaking weird it's not very sweet and I guess it's kind it's like whole ingredients just thrown together and it's very like one layer birthday cake in your mouth yeah I'm like you have like that player [Music] [Music] honestly that's my favorite like when you showed it to me oh yeah chocolate peanut butter one yeah I have like ten calories now all right let's see what this apparently no it's not as like light it sounds like crunchy fluffy light here Harry it's more like dense packed but still you can see really good [Music] it reminds me more of like a cereal bar relevantly oh that's it yeah it's a good cereal bar which I think it's still really delicious it's not flavor-wise it's perfect like oh it's a tie they're both similar but different all right that is a wrap on our protein bar try hull of the worst and the best a lot of proteins are but definitely the best one is the first form level one good to the area pause on donkey can't because they're really good and then the kid shoots my I forgot the other flavors of these don't try the other flavors as well I have a bunch of protein bars and I can happen like this doesn't mean all bars just a fun flavor it's really good overall and then to marshmallow bars and in the build bars so overall those are public your top picks with the bar as well if you have not already and you can just right there us suffer less because thank you for watching [Music] [Music]", "XZ2YAxJ_Kd8": "[Music] you gotta let me all right i'm going to do a full day of eating for you guys and i'm going to have this built bar as i work on my last

contacts and this one's bothering me a little bit um contacts are so hard to wear but i really want to wear contacts when i'm in the gym because it's so hot there's no air conditioning and it's supposed to be like almost 100 today so um contacts are a little bit easier i have two pairs of blue and then this green contact i do have like clear regular ones but i like to have more fun i guess um anyways it is 11 15 and i am going to take the dogs for a walk they have not been on a walk in like four days because i've been flying or it's been raining so um yeah i'm gonna take them for just a

holds i hold i held up to 200 pounds just for like six to ten seconds just to get the feel for it and um i was gonna go up a little bit higher but i'm like i don't know whatever anyways and then i did doubles starting at 140 150 160 and then it singles at 170 175 and 180. the current uspa iowa state record for my weight class is 170. eight or nine i can't remember um and i did it all 175 180 by myself without a spotter with a pause so i'm really freaking pumped about that i think that my second attempt is going to be like 170 2 and a half um just depending on what other people do for their first attempt so i'm going to kind of engage and see what they do and who i'm up against but i really want to break the state record unless some sort of like she-hulk comes in and she does way more than that so um yeah anyways i'm really excited and i got a package that i'm going to open and show you guys what is inside but that's it for now oh and then i did some accessories i did dumbbell overhead press standing and then machine chest flies just doing like rpe seven seven and a half or so nothing too crazy because my volume is tapering down this week and then i did push-ups because i'm

then spray butter and then we have cheese flavored grits i've never had the cheese flavored before and i put some flowers seasoning salt in there too oh we're fogging up so i'm going to try this out it's really interesting because it's a dry pack and there's actually chunks of cheese in it i don't know we'll see but i'm gonna eat this and then i have lots of meal prep to do so i will show you guys my meal prep update the grits were okay they're not very cheesy especially put some ketchup in there i know it's probably kind of weird but that's what i did denver was able to finish licking my plate and jaxy as well i am going to have some of my favorite if you guys have not tried these you are missing out they are so so good and i have had like no fats today so this is gonna be like a sweet treat and to get some fats in here are the macros i'll probably have like 20 grams but highly recommend these from trader joe's i'm gonna have one of my favorite treats let's see that maybe so starting to storm this is my skinny sweets mini tagalong donut they're the macros and it's so good so i just take this from the freezer and let me have a bite [Music] it is so good so so let me finish this i'll get back to you it reminds me of the mini chocolate donuts you get like in the package from the gas stations so good and the chocolate is like solid hard once i get in the middle you'll be able to see some peanut butter there's like a really thin layer of peanut butter on top so i will show you that but it's so good side note from wearing the mask all the time on the plane and having to yell my voice box is so exhausted all the time and i feel like i'm like i'm about to lose my voice like 24 7. it's driving me crazy and if i go a long time without talking then it's like worse obviously so um yeah i'm going to enjoy this i only have three more of these so i'm really sad i need to order more they are so good and i'm getting it in my throat now all right i'll show you guys all right here is the inside you can see like there's a really thin layer of peanut butter at the top but it's just like the perfect amount um it would be nice to have more but obviously that would make the macaroons go up higher but it is so good literally just out of the freezer so just keep them in the freezer so they stay longer my poor girl is getting scared oh it's okay baby it's okay should we take your cbd oil but anyways you guys should try skinny sweets she is the sweetest owner of the business skinny sweets has the sweetest owner anyways i'm gonna enjoy this and i'll show you guys my meal prep poor baby say hi this is my second favorite part of the day just laying down and cuddling with the puppies my favorite part is the end of the night when i make my giant salad and bowl of snacks if i have macros saved for that which is usually popcorn the enlightened bean things and whatever i can find that fits my macros um that is my favorite part and just like relaxing and watching netflix and just shutting off but i'm just gonna lay here for the dogs for a little bit stretch and then i will meal prep this is the day in the life all right so i'm making baby potatoes in the air fryer and i'm going to do a southwest style chicken in the airfryer after the potatoes are done and then i am going to chop up some yellow squash and i'm doing zucchini in my um i figured this thing is called right now um anyways i'm going to make this um into like little strings for zots i used to always mix oats like three four five years ago um so it's zucchini oatmeal just for lots of volume and lower carbs i'm not that i'm lower carbs but i do miss the volume in this so i'm going to show you guys the after final product oh i also have some 96 lean ground beef cooking all right i've got most of the meal prep done so i put taco seasoning in my 96 lean ground beef so i've got five servings of that and then i have four servings of the mini potatoes with flowery seasoning salt made these in the airfryer and i just sauteed these on the frying pan it's my yellow squash and i just put larry seasoning salt and butter spray on there so i've got two trays of those and then two containers of um shredded zucchini and it's a huge container like this thing is so heavy this is a really big container too but it's not obviously completely full so i'm going to make zots with these i will probably do that in the next video like a full day of eating probably tomorrow we will see so um and then over here trick to doing meal prep do all your dishes as you go i just have to do that one so everything is nice and clean and i've got my chicken in the airfryer that should be done pretty soon and i've got five servings with that all right meal plan meal pleb meal prep is complete and i've got all the chicken and my beef and all my stuff you guys already saw that so anyways um i am finishing this ginger ale from aldi it's not very good i do not recommend it um the cola is even worse i think that the cream soda is okay and the root beer is okay ginger ale and cola may okay i am going to take the dogs for a stroll so i will see you guys sometime later i've got kind of a mess here just got on vacuuming though so at least the floors are clean and i'm washing the kitchen rugs she's in the kitchen where that rug's supposed to be finishing some computer works i'm having a snack this is the too good yogurt it's not too flavorful but there's only three grams of carbs to fat and then 12 protein in here so i've got that and add a little bit of water because it's kind of thick and i topped it with my skinny syrup billionaire shortbread it's pretty good it's not like the best but it's definitely pretty good i get it from the protein pick and mix on instagram from the uk so it's kind of expensive so make sure you get a lot of stuff to make the shipping worth it and then i topped it with some safe and fair birthday cake granola this is so good guys i swear it's literally so so flavorful um free from the nine like all that typical allergy stuff there are the macros and i just have like one third of a serving on there so just to add a little bit of crunch and it tastes bomb and then some blueberries of course so i'm gonna eat this and do finish some client plans and i will see you guys at my next meal all right here is my final meal so i've got my giant salad per usual and i have like a half of a joseph's bladfish wrap with half serving of laughing cow cheese wedge and then put some beer mustard on it i got this at aldi i don't know if they have this anymore but it is so good so if you guys can find it it's really really good and then some chicken deli meat and then i'm gonna have this entire bag of this shrewd shrewd food i cannot talk today um protein puffs the pizza flavor is pretty good i've tried this in the cheddar i think i don't know if there's any more than that but i'm gonna have this whole bag so there's about three servings per container it's not full of three servings if you weigh it on your food scale so i'm gonna eat this and watch some netflix i'm finishing riverdale i'm on season three i haven't watched it in a very long time so that's it for today guys", "kabVw2OyuKM": "attention i want my videos to look like this and not like this so if you're under the age of 21 and don't have a medical marijuana card leave

about going to the moon products taking me to the moon going to the moon and back being over the moon moon moon moon moon moon moon moon well today guys we are actually going to be visiting the Moon Moon cosmic cappuccino that is 250 milligrams of THC we've got it right here the first time we are reviewing anything from this brand the Moon whoops again the Moon brand the cosmic cappuccino I'm not even really sure what this is to be honest I'm not even really sure what this thing is maybe it's some kind of cappuccino flavored wafer I I don't know I don't know it's gonna be a mystery for us all we're all gonna find out at the same time and I hope that like the product says it does take me to the moon and back it's Moon megadose chocolate bars is the name of the company and it's been cosmic cappuccino and on the back it says intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- that's fun so uh if you've never tuned in to wait weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this product and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review all right guys I can grab some scissors real quick I'll be right back we'll open it up and give it a taste all right here we go trying to get it out all right here we go here is our wafer or what I assume is a wafer there is a strong weed odor to it let's give it a bite not a wafer just a long skinny chocolate bar with a cup of key no flavor on my cappuccino I mean cappuccino thank you Arrested Development it's good good quality chocolate liked it quite a bit perfect melting point it had a strong cannabis scent but well there is a cannabis taste to it it's really not that strong it's not that bad at all quite like it in fact well guys I'm gonna finish off this cosmic cappuccino looking forward to it and then I will come back to you guys in just two hours selecting a homegoing but for you guys will just be a couple seconds see you then peace [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours since I had the moon mega dose chocolate bars with their intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- and I gotta say unfortunately I am not at the moon I am more like at the you know sort of the International Space Station somewhere in the stratosphere definitely not on the moon certainly not on the moon and back it's not terrible I don't want to suggest it's terrible I'm at probably a for me maybe a 5 somewhere between a 4 and a 5 you know like that kind of level of high this was a $15.00 edible so you know you can't complain too much for that price that's a little worse than average but not substantially so I did like how it tasted tasted great there was just like cannabis taste but the rest of the chocolate was nice and smooth and creamy and had a great cappuccino flavor but I'm just not as high as I was hoping to be with the moon megadose chocolate bars here I was I was certainly hoping to be you know somewhere in outer space but yet I am still terrestrial what can you do alright guys thank you so much for watching wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the later view peace", "qz5pSdF50_w": "[Music]

inside something that i absolutely love all right so we have the western bagel i am obsessed with these they are so good there are discount codes i use a discount and i don't remember which one it was but you can find a discount code anyway so here is what i got i've had these before the perfect 10 plus bagels and here is an example of the macros and they are 71 grams so they are pretty good size and they're made with pea protein this comes with six bagels and then i also have the everything bagel in that and then i'm also trying the mac's so perfect 10 max bagels they just have more protein a little bit more carbs and then a little bit more fat but they are also way bigger so here are the macros organs are fat 29 carbs and 29 protein and they only come with four bagels in here so these are more expensive as well they're 50 cents more for two less bagels than the perfect 10 which are a little bit smaller less carbs um but overall they're really good i highly recommend the perfect 10 plus or the perfect max pencil smacks um anyways try some western bagels i'm not with them or anything um but they are really good you can order them online though and that's a wrap i'll see you guys in

shrine it's really good buy this one [Applause] you go so high and it's 325 feet up in the air I'm not sure what I think about that for we're one you and now we're back for scarrans it's entirely healed like he's my world right now but we are here going to ride the Intimidator which was the first drive-thru road [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the first haunted attraction with no me wishes you really want hey guys okay so I wanted to kind of give you a little sit down a prep update and kinda let you know where I'm at I feel and just how preps going overall so I have been working with my coach Paul now since the end of June my last competition was junior US Junior Nationals in Chicago June like 14 15 or so and I started working Paul shortly after that we started off with a reverses diet and we reversed my calories up pretty high I was eating around 2100 2200 every day and doing 30 minutes of cardio I'm gonna say it like four times a week or so just kind of keep that in there KYNA body as lean as possible throughout my reverse and I went really well I was not hungry at all like I felt amazing in the gym and just everything was just so so good I stuck to my plan 280 even going into like Paris and London just all my international trips and whatnot so just it's crazy to think that your mine is such a powerful thing that if you want something bad enough you truly can do it no matter how hard it is I mean someone might cave instantaneously when others can really push through so it's just it's crazy and yes I will take pride and having a very strong willpower and strong like if I'm going to do something I'm gonna stick to it and do it that's usually like in bigger goals and challenges now if I say I'm going to mow the lawn might not do that today might not do it tomorrow but with big and hard challenges I can stick to it so anyways um so now I am like 50 days out or so from Nationals in Miami and okay let's see I am six going to be six weeks out at the end of this week today's Tuesday so I'm about five weeks out herself just under six weeks crazy I am so excited well wait hold on okay I'm wrong I'm just under seven weeks out so I've got six and a half about seven weeks or so until Miami national so a little bit more time than I and really I really thought so that's good but my body and my physique everything I feel like is almost my leanness that I've been yet so it's really crazy really exciting I feel really good I'm sleeping really well I prioritize my sleep over everything so make sure that I plan out my sleep and then I'll kind of like backtrack or plan around that so make sure that I'm getting fully rested which is very important especially if you have a lot of cardio if your gym sessions are hard and you're just busy so I'm a very busy person I get around 15,000 to 18,000 steps per day per my Apple watch I don't know how accurate that is I'm drinking about 200 ounces of water about two hundred and forty or fifty ounces of fluids total per day and I have try I try and have around 300 to max 600 milligrams of caffeine a day and my food I'm eating good amount of food I don't really like to share all of my macros and everything just because I don't want other people to replicate that and thinking that that's what they need to do but my calories aren't goods but I will let you know that they're not pretty low or anything yet we might have to push just to really get to that ultimate stage conditioning but you never know cardio is there cardio is there I'll just leave that up there I'm not doing anything besides steady-state cardio so I am walking at an incline and I'm doing a little bit of stairs post lifting so my incline walking usually do in the morning or I'll do it later on just whenever I can so the only cardio I'm doing post gym as stairs right after I lift and then most of my food honestly I'm eating very very clean diet so I'm basically following the vertical diet from stayin efforting my body has never felt better than it does now like it feels so amazing I don't know if that's in turn it's like sleeping well and all that but I feel so good my strength is up in the gym I'm eating pretty much this chicken turkey beef eggs every single day interchangeably with those and then have one built bar a day and I'm now affiliated with built bars they're literally the most amazing protein bar out there and they taste like candy bars they taste like Milky Way they're so good so I highly recommend to get some built bars if you have not tried them yet I have the website down in the description box below and make sure you use my code sage fit but if you follow the link the code will automatically go in there for you and it's free shipping so they're so good those are my protein sources and then my carbs I'm basically just eating potatoes oats rice and rice cakes that's about it for my carbs and yeah just keeping it really really simple for my vegetables I have a spinach shake again from the vertical diet so I have three ounces of frozen spinach three ounces of orange juice or sorry three cups of frozen spinach three ounces of low sugar orange juice and a little bit of water probably about three or four ounces or so depending on how liquidy you want it to be and then I'll also add a scoop of my get opportun fruits and greens I can't even think right now my fruits and greens I get from total nutrition they are literally still amazing at the Pinal pineapple splash vape flavor I cannot talk right now it's a pineapple splash flavor and it just makes it perfect so try that if you have not tried yet and then green beans of course on my other vegetable that I'm having so that's pretty much my diet and having stevia for my sweetener and I will use for condiments I will have a little bit of Walden farm sugar-free syrup I just discovered birch benders they have a keto syrup as well and it's like zero colors essentially and I use that a little bit too it doesn't taste quite as good as well on the farm stuff in my opinion and it's a little more expensive so that's it for the food I was having bananas and blueberries until my calories got cut about a week ago and I just want to stick with more foods that are here to keep me full of it longer fruits are gonna digest a little faster so that's the reason I kind of got rid of those and you know I'll have them eventually so I'm not too sad I'd rather just be more full and content and perform better so that's the most important to me next for my supplements I am taking fish oil multivitamins I have am 66 which is a type of ashwagandha or ashwagandha really good for anxiety of stress cortisol all that stuff and then also I'm taking dim which is a estrogen support and it's like just natural for you it helps keep you like your female hormones and everything in check and again I think cortisol not too familiar with it but my coach told me that I should be taking that so I just followed my instructions um anyways I think that's all for the supplements I take a ginger too every morning as well just because I really like ginger and they are so tasty so I have those every morning with my coffee that's it guys I'm literally keeping it super simple into the point and ice when I kind of share that with you where I'm at prep and what I eat and drink and all that I guys decide with drinking I will have sparkling water so I used to and my previous preps have a Powerade or Gatorade zero and I would have one of the flavored waters from like Walmart but those have sweeteners in them and I switched you like the flavored Seltzer's and I usually don't like that stuff but they're actually pretty good I have the polar brand they went a little polar bear that one is really good at the cranberry lime or something like that it's super good and then harris-teeter actually has their own brand seemeth Target and they're all pretty darn good so I will have maybe one of those a day and if I want a diet soda I'll have a diet soda but it's not like a whole big thing of the sugar free flavored water so um I think I'm gonna close this video out because I don't want to be too long but I just want to give you guys an update and let you know where I'm at and how preps going so thank you so much for following along thank you for giving me the support make sure you give me a thumbs up if you like this video leave me a comment will you like to see in future videos and I will to you in the next one [Music] [Music]", "azfEAvUAOXs": "[Music] hey guys and welcome to the

is strong guys alright so my carb sources are just going to be rice cakes grits and potatoes pretty much all week that's all I'm going to be having and I'm actually going to switch to my natural almond butter or starting like Thursday or Friday Friday for sure a Friday and Saturday but instead of my all-american nut butters I just gonna have like the plain stuff and here are the macros pretty good macros on this and then pickles for show day for that pickle pump it's all about the pickle pump guys and then I'm gonna bring some of this with me to iOS so I can just keep on putting this in my coffee like I do every single day I also have a bunch of cans of these cut Italian green beans I get them at Walmart here are the macros these are the best because there are there's less one gram of sugar and yeah I just like to have green beans they're really easy to digest for me I have most of my protein probably through Friday maybe Thursday or Friday frozen and in baggies so it's all good to go so when I get to Iowa I will probably go to the store on Wednesday and then prep a little bit more so I have enough for a Friday Saturday Sunday Monday whatever I just kind of extend that but I have enough for at least through Thursday and it's already all prepped and everything for me for the fridge stuff I will be having egg whites and my egg beaters and then turkey bacon as well because I have it every single day and I'm gonna have my built bar so I'll probably stop having these on like Tuesday maybe Wednesday I have one built bar a day and then condiments I have my reduced sugar ketchup and then the Walden Farms pancake syrup which I will again take these out probably starting Wednesday and that's about it I have a cucumber I'm gonna have a cucumber today and for the next couple days old all right honestly that is it I'm keeping everything pretty basic minimal and just simple into the point because one this is how my body just likes I mean this is the these are the foods if my body likes best and I don't want to mess up anything and take any risks or chances so I do have one thing that I'm gonna have for like a post-show treat if I decide to have it so I'm gonna bring it with me my Lyons choice this is one of the brand new flavors it's the infusions the zebra cake so I'm really excited to try this out I'll probably just have a little bit post-show because like I said I'm doing back-to-back peak weeks so I'm gonna be pretty much on my game after my competition so we'll see what coach says but that's my plan as of now and yeah I will show you when I have

didn't find anything which is good so I went to my doctor so she can like feel it and just kind of talk to me and turns out it is just basically inflamed what is it called connective tissues not the bone not my rib but what connects it oh my gosh I cannot cartilage and it is exactly called stand-by costochondritis so that's basically what she diagnosed me with nothing too serious or anything like that and I can still keep pushing in the gym and lifting and basically just inflamed so I need to take a leave and or go to a chiropractor do get some treatments done so anyways I'm almost to the gym so I will see you guys there and I can build [Music] sorry guys I did not take you to my workout it was I mean it's such a new environment for me and I was pretty busy so I did not want to just break

show you guys what my inspiration is and we will go from there so this is one of the photos and then this is the other photo so something probably more like this one and of course these stores didn't have any regular Donuts or like a ones that they usually have they just have like Halloween ones so I got some plain ones and I'm going to decorate them myself and yeah my dad's gonna help me it's my first layer cake that I've ever made so I'm really excited for this so I hope it turns out for the people who try it but most it's gonna be a photo prep so I'm not too worried about it as long as it looks nice so you guys saw me before the attempt and stay tuned for the after done grease and flour the bottom of the cake pan and line with parchment paper done whisk flour baking powder and salt together aside now that my butter and sugar is mixed and creamy I reduced the speed to low and I'm gonna add three eggs and some vanilla extract [Music] [Music] [Music] all right now the true hard part about baking is not looking the paddle when you just want to try the batter I'm such a bad or eater give me a thumbs up if you love to eat batter almost more than you like to eat the final products cakes are good and ready to go into the oven quick little break I'm making my next meal have two whole eggs and 100 grams of egg beaters and rice cakes of course my rice cakes are taking over my parents cupboard three rice cakes about five more minutes before the cakes are ready to be checked on but I'm making the vanilla buttercream right now and I'm going to whisk together egg whites and sugar so starting with that and then I have to move it to simmering water and continue to fluff it and everything to make like the meringue so stay tuned and we'll see if this works out look good smell good and I have my Butterfinger line [Applause] cute butter [Applause] so we have going on here got more butter and vanilla to put in there and then assembly time self at heart and I'm going to make them the top of the cake decorations right now turn this Apple doughnut into a sprinkled donut by melting white chocolate and covering in sprinkles and guys we have buttercream frosting check it out where one is done and buttercreamed temper too when you feel is over when you say tada I did it not too pretty around the edges but it's not complete so I'm going to put this in a fridge to chill and then I'm going to assemble the rest of it I'm so excited smells like cake I just got the fridge and I'm finished putting the buttercream on top so here we are right now I am [Music] we are working with so far stay tuned for the final product I made my first layer cake and it's a doughnut cake it's my donut birthday cake so proud [Music]", "FOwBYg5mHGE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] pretty pumped about this box and what's inside Denver what do you think girl she doesn't care stay tuned guys alright here is my meal I'm really excited about this so this is the western bagel it's Dee's cinnamon spiced bagels and then I have my egg beaters cheese and everything but the bagel seasoning plus I'm like Lowery's and I put some spray butter and cinnamon on these check them out it is it smells so good seriously so here's what is 128 or 120 calories like 29 carbs I think the alternative bagels and these are a little bit smaller they do have a higher protein one that's only like 19 or 20 carbs my stomach is growling but a good amount of fiber as well so decent for like a pretty filling meal but I'm gonna eat this and I also have my green shake not shake drink so I'm using the amazing grass holiday cookie tie and it does not taste like holiday cookies so don't get excited I did a review of this and\u00f6 fit chick so make sure to check it out and you have my spray butter cinnamon I'm gonna eat guys and then I'll show you the goods package number one we have athletic protein this is cookie dough so I think I don't like about this so far one it was in a really tiny box so things are squished like this and it doesn't say what they are have the nutrition facts on the labels obviously this is a that one extra toes go using the cream cookie so the macros are really really good backers on that one - all right take that back there's Macker in some of these this one's really light no macros on this one I don't know what that is no Macker on that one and then no macros on this one this is cookie dough these are little cakes and then nothing on this squished little guy either so anyways I'm gonna be reviewing and trying these again follow me on go fetch it because you will find all my reviews on there Xbox we have my G pop so here is the nutrition label and I have the monthly subscription so I get two boxes of these and it's like thirty for a month usually it's like 24 per box so the subscription ants free shipping so the scrip subscription is the way to go and I have all four flavors so I've got two flavors in there and then inside this one I also have the birthday cake so you guys want to try it use my discount code CH fit you will save some money and I think you'd save it on your subscription so definitely sign up for that lastly I got DS this is supposed to be a sweatshirt from United monograms Irish so it's really cute but it's supposed to be a crewneck sweatshirt not cool CH then this one is a crewneck sweatshirt so they're supposed to be like this but I thought this was so cute and fitting for me airplane mode here is they look inside my box don't know what's in here but all the meals are in baggies and they try obviously to keep them together so don't break during shipment there was paper and stuff on top too but of course that's not always gonna happen so if your meals containers are broken chill it's gonna be fine just put them in something else usually they have extra containers as well so anyways I'm gonna show you guys what we have so here are all of my meals we have breakfast pizza with Parmesan and it's a strawberry and white chocolate protein bar down there and a beef burger with twisted chips and some sort of sauce dip I'm not for sure chicken with pasta this one's had a little rougher head and this one I'm super super heavy it is potato bowl so this one's right around 36 grams of carbs or so and then we have a cookie dough round with chocolate chips last time I had one of those rounds they are so so good pretty pumped about that and then we have creamy cheesy chicken with twisted chips and green peas and a beef with white rice simple and to the point looks like there's some sort of cheese in there as well and we have cheesy spicy chicken with white rice here looks like some black olives too for a little over and chicken with twisted ships and green beans twist chips I've never had before but I've gone three times now today steak with pasta simple to the point looks delish oh my gosh some chips all right the mess behind chip kick creamy cheesy chicken nachos that sounds are really good like some salsa and then we have pot roast with white rice there pot roast is to die for and cheesy spicy chicken with twisted chips and spaghetti squash okay five meals of chips that's crazy I hope I like them I'm sure I will but still and then we've got a blueberry protein bar and vanilla perks pretty pumped again follow me on my social media Instagram and I post all my foods and what I think about them all right so I just got done lifting sorry it's really about lighting and I ate my twisted foods I forgot to show you guys but terrible lighting I am vacuuming right now and I'm really excited because my vacuum is freaking awesome it's a shark pee something fifty and I highly recommend it I literally did so much research for hours and watch a lot of YouTube videos and people comparing this to the Dyson something something similar it's a stick vacuum and I highly recommend it it is so good so my Roomba went around the house for like an hour and 45 minutes and then I just took this through and literally just got all of that so Roomba I mean it's good but this is literally amazing I do this like every other day and it gets a lot of dog hair done for shedding really bad right now so definitely recommend it hit swivels really easily you charge the battery so it's cordless and um pretty light it's easy to like do the stairs and everything and then you can switch from carpet to floor and which the Dyson does didn't have that feature you have to press and hold the entire time and you have to change the roller when you want to go from carpet to floor so this one definitely beat setup for user ability forget what I'm trying to think of right now but you guys know what I mean so anyways if you're looking for a good new vacuum definitely spend some money to get a good quality one and I recommend the shark ion let it's like p50 something like that so yeah let me help you any questions and it is totally worth every single dollar that I spent but I'm gonna finish vacuuming that was just from downstairs I'm gonna do the stairs and upstairs so I'm gonna do that and continue on with my lovely Friday night alright so I figured I would just show you guys um so it's super easy you just lift this out and this whole thing comes off to dump the dirt debris dog hair whatever and then you can clean the brushes which there's some dog hair built up in that brush so I'm going to cleaning that out but there's the do different brushes that it'll switch from and then the stick it's the wand comes out really easy just push that up and you can lift it up which I'm going to be doing the stairs with and then here's the handle so you can just obviously hit power and then you switch them carpet to floor and then it also has that boost option which will take up a little more battery and then the battery right there it has three bars and then you slipped it up to let's take it out and charge it and it'll show you obviously once it's dying the battery the bars will go down a little bit and then it's just really easy to use you just look right there and voila so yeah I definitely recommend this shark whatever you are but it's cordless and that is freaking game changer so I don't think I've showed you guys my supplement um stash cabinet for I don't know if I have your have but um yes take a look all of my goodies um eat me guilt-free gee pot built bars like no other all of my nut butters all American butter all of my Fit butters Macker snacks more built bars back there and then all of the pre-workout BCA's vitamin fruits and greens and protein and then I've got a little wine I'm running out of wine though send more wine so I should also note that the vacuum another highlight is that it lights up so in your vacuuming you can see all of the like dirt and dust and stuff that you're gonna be vacuuming up which is really cool I think and I just realize that the big part of it comes off when you're like wanna do the stairs and whatnot so like actually roller the whole bottom area is you don't need that so that was really really light it's time to do the stairs I think that's everything but then here's yeah I'm really excited about a vacuum how sad is that alright I'm going to get to do other things right now I don't really know what I'm doing 7 o'clock so on a Friday night I fly tomorrow all day I think I'd like 4 flights tomorrow anyways I'm going to get my laundry done this when we to laundry in the dryer so I will show you guys my next meal probably going to be a big salad per usual amount of egg salad kick so alright I'll see you guys in a bit alright here is my giant salad in this big popcorn bowl but spinach lettuce blueberries tomatoes radish and I have a like pecan dried blueberry mix and croutons I think that's everything and then for dressing I'm going to use my Walden farm Caesar and the best barbecue sauce that I found guys Ward winning barbecue sauce smoky bacon flavor and the macros are quite solid alright I'm gonna eat this and then I'm gonna put some like Lowery's or something like that on there as well and spray butter but seriously it looks so good alright I'm coming at you guys with a full day of eating and here is the breakfast lineup so I made my taco eggs and what I do is have scrambled eggs spinach and then shredded lettuce and then I put some salsa and this is the salsas that I've been on a kick with lately it is so good I got this in Colorado but I think it's from Arizona uh yep it's from Arizona it's really good I highly recommend it and then I use the Trader Joe's chunky guacamole with Greek yogurt and some plain Greek yogurt and then for my special half of my English muffin I've topped it with fit butters this is a brand new independence cake and it tastes like the sugar cookies you buy at the store with like a mile pile high of frosting on top it is so good here are the macros so ourselves actually 1/4 of a serving it's just enough to make it taste super good and then some spray butter on the other two pieces so I'm gonna eat this and then go hit the gym I am about to head to the gym I just want to show you real quick what I had I had everything bagel not bagel everything but the bagel whatever everything's seasoned I'm a rice cake so I just had that and I'm having this broken arrow hailstorm pre-workout rep sports so I have not tried this flavor yet smells very fruity very good I don't know what it smells like exactly but I'm gonna try it and I'm gonna review and\u00f6 fit chick so stay tuned I also just got done reviewing ten different protein cookie dough's so make sure you go check out my reviews follow me if you are not already but I'm gonna go hit my workout I also had a couple bites of a built bar so it's been a little while since I'd my breakfast but I'm gonna go train back and byes so I'll see you guys later right here is my post-workout meal and I crying jags you've got food the same thing you have for breakfast alright anyways this is my twisted foods I'll show you guys outside of better lighting but what we have so this is the chips I came with it there's not very many and it's really high carb so I don't know I'm swap that out for my Joseph's PITA so you can make these into chips if you have not already just put it in the microwave I sprayed it with like cooking spray and then I topped it with some spray of butter and then I'm gonna dip it in this mustard which is phenomenal I got this from all of you it's beer mustard they have one other flavor I forget what flavor it is but I'm gonna dip my pita chips in there and I covered my food and Lowry seasoning salt which I put on like everything it's really good so we've got some chicken I don't even know just pulled chicken creamy cheesy chicken with chips and green peas so there's no way the peas or that many carbs and then like that amount of chips like that's really sad so anyways I'm just gonna use my best judgment to subtract the chips and then put my Akita instead since I'm not in prep I'm not going to be like too strict on it but again the peas aren't going to be that many carbs and then for the rest to be all those chips like that doesn't really add up if unless they're like super high I don't know they're just not very good and I don't want to waste my carbs on something that I don't like so I'm going to eat this and I'll check in with you guys in a bit go get your food buddy he's begging for something I'll probably go through the chips alright here is the twisted foods and my Joseph's pita chips so I think that figure this is better lighting for here to see out here and I totally forgot but here's my sleeve I just finished the bottom part so that's what I had and so I just added on it's really hard to do this by myself but anyway I hope you can see and I'm not totally just like showing you the ground my giant salad of a meal I'm having a huge salad every night I put like spinach the garden mixed tomatoes blueberries croutons cucumbers and much like seasonings and then I use at Walden Farms dressing and like I think tonight I used barbecue sauce and I'll use whatever I feel like with the ginger sauce G his ginger super good but how many piss and some carrots and my laughing cow cheese which I love these things they are so so good should we go watch a movie what all right I'm going to unplug watch movie and probably he'll have other snacks like popcorn and stuff hey why don't you at your dinner all right I officially apologize I've been the worst at vlogging lately but I just realized that I think it's

Black Friday special and then underneath I actually have another alpha Lee it's the one where it cut out right here I highly recommend athlete my first purchase from them very very impressed very soft very perfect like the fitting is perfect it's true to your size and yeah we have a special guest just tonight Jesse come here say hello Oh use not coming oh say hi to the people I'm like joking about say hey yellow okay go they turn me oh she wants to say hello to all right I'm an openness good lay down her here so I'm gonna go ahead and say I open the box upside down but I don't think it's a big deal so anyways here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Liz come [Music] all is right [Music] Dion virgin Oh [Music] only infant suits [Music] in heavenly peace sleeeeep [Music] [Music] god [Music] pure radians names from the [Music] fifteen Jesus Lord at thy birth Jesus loved come all ye faithful Oh [Music] oh come Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yup boxes seen better days YUM okay chocolate bread look so good [Music] oh my gosh I'm so cute I love this this is so like such a special touch to it oh my gosh it makes me so happy alright one last thing guys oh this is my favorite I literally just used my last serving today I have not tried the cherry fine yet I've tried Apple like the mixed berry I love cherry and cherries like a holiday type fruit I believe I think so anyways oh this is so good 9 calories per 20 grams and stuff is legit whenever I go overseas again I'm gonna stock up and get like 50 of these jars because they are so good and so macro friendly anyway that is a wrap on everything that she got for me I am finishing her box this week today is Thursday today tomorrow over the weekend I met my goal is to mail it out on Monday morning so you're gonna have to watch her video to see what I get for her I might give you a little sneak peek in a video coming up but otherwise I'm gonna try a couple of things and I will let you guys know what I think okay she is literally the sweetest she's been getting training at mostly gluten-free stuff because I'm supposed to be looking for you she doesn't have to but she tries to accommodate for me so I'm going to try the emails like there's cancer this ginger ginger bread something like that and I don't know the exact calories per cookie but the whole bag is tuner 50 grams and it's kind of heavy and per 100 grams we have fifteen point seven grams of fat 70 carbs and five protein so I imagine it's not too terribly much for cooking alright here is the cookie and it actually smells like chocolate so I need to figure out what exactly it is but it smells chocolatey hmm it reminds me of something very very familiar it almost reminds me of an Oreo cookie like on the outside of an Oreo just a cookie but a little bit different did that even make sense I don't have to really good just chocolate cookie all right I definitely thought my gosh that was so good all right next up I'm going to try these little O's crackers and it's with lentils and chickpeas I don't know what flavor this is but the entire bag is 2 grams of fat 9 carbs and 5 proteins so not too bad at all they're kind of broken but here is what it's looking like [Music] has a really nice crunch to it and I [Music] cannot detect the flavor but it's really good garbanzo beans and I can definitely say something in part to it I really like it's nice simple like flavored nothing too strong and nothing too mild it's not like cardboard E or anything like that five-second rule more like 35 second rule all right Morgan type something else I like that and I want something a little more sweet now okay I'm gonna try this protein pancake it is caramel and for the entire staying at 45 grams it weighs it's 2 grams of fat 12 carbs and 16 protein so really good macros I have high hopes for this baby whoo-oo they actually really cute pancakes or is it one big oh it's a caramel filled one oh this is so cute this is really like soft and I'm excited to try this so let's go ahead and break it open oh my gosh I need to take a picture of this for my Instagram hold on okay now for the taste test again there is the aesthetic nough stew it this is exciting smells really good too I'm sure to be better in the microwave but I don't feel like getting up and go in that kitchen that was really good I think you're definitely better at microwaved and a little bit of my spray butter maybe a little syrup on top but the caramel is really really good oh my gosh I want like 500 more of these I need to order them online if I can oh my gosh this is like perfectly sweet soft and squishy and just melt in your mouth I'm gonna wash it down with some almond milk almond milk eggnog okay last thing I want to try are these big cheese things so zero carbs six grams of fat and seven protein for 15 grams so it's like the cheese with whisks that we have but I mean everything is better in Italy and overseas so let's go and give these a try and see how they compare actually Amy's little packs how cute [Music] these are really good the cheese definitely tastes different than it does here I don't know why but everything is different overseas and it's so much better Denver is drooling you want to try a little one [Music] tell her what you think it's a good is it good if it's good give me a kiss it's good all right that's all I'm gonna try for now I'm gonna put all these things into MyFitnessPal and yeah anyways I hope you guys enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up let me know everything and yeah if you enjoy seeing videos

those and then one other one that I have not yet try it is the vegan cookie batter almond butter and we have eleven point nine grams of fat six point two carbs and four point seven protein in this so I like the vegan ones because it has less protein because I have no issues hitting my protein goals for the day so those ones are really good um then my favorite too birthday cake almond butter this

one is the Tigers blood and I've noticed what the big noise let me know if you guys have tried this - it sounds like an earthy taste to it so I'm sort of like earthiness like spinach dirt like I don't know it's not bad but it's like it's different I don't really know what that is so I haven't really studied the nutrition label quite yet so let me know if you guys have had the extreme experience so I'm gonna have that and then I have my EAS that I'm gonna drink in my 75 ounces of water during my workout I try and get in my full 75 ounces so there's that and oh the big thing I'm on call today so

so I'm still hanging in there as number one I think people are going aggressive for trips we have like no reserves so they red-flag paying which means they get paid time and a half if you are a line holder which I'm going to reserve this month I'm not a line holder so there's that I'm just waiting for my fate to call me any second so I'm gonna hit to the gym headed to the gym and I'll see you

guys and welcome to the vlog I have been so bad at recording I have a lot of video content to get out and edited so that's why I've been kind of behind because if I'm not doing that and I'm still logging it doesn't really add up 70 way so we have Makayla here we have a Makayla we're about to take the dogs from stroke because I've been trying to do a computer work trying to meal prep and they've been crying crazy craziness but I wanted to show you guys some of the things that I got in the mail I'm really excited about I definitely took advantage of the Black Friday Cyber Monday all the things giving goodie sales so I'm a little bummed because I had a delivery a few days ago and two items one was my gem shark order and one was something from Amazon came via UPS said it was delivered on my steps and it was never delivered so I'm missing two packages very upset about that I've been trying to contact them and get a missing claim and everything reported but there's that that's what happens when you order 25 packages I guess you have a few missing at least no one's stole it because I was literally here when they said it was delivered but nobody ever actually came so anyways I'm gonna show you some things that I got I'm really excited about first we have mussel egg so I got the chocolate mocha and the cake batter I literally didn't know which flavors to get they're all really good but this one's been in the freezer and then this one is in the fridge because they're both a gallon here are the calories and yeah this was a Black Friday sale wouldn't normally buy it but it was like 40 50 percent off soon like that so yeah I will make some fun recipes with these I've tried it and they are really good it freaks me out to drink egg whites but I promise you guys they're good we have the december snack nation box if you guys have seen it before I get this monthly subscription it's only $5 a box and you just have to review whatever you try if you don't try anything you have to review it and so these here's what we have parmesan with these are really good I love them and so you have in a wake bar caffeinated chocolate bar that sounds really good maple barbecue pork stick okay I love maple in barbecue definitely excited to try that out then there's usually some sort of fruit bar so I've got a pure pineapple natural dried fruit bar and we've got some baked apple chips I love apples my stomach doesn't usually agree with them but we will try the baked kind I guess see if that works and tahini bar sesame Co supercede sesame about our vanilla flavored that sounds really good see what the macros are like on this bad boy we've got 9 grams of carbs 6 fat 2 protein not bad only 100 calories for this so I will good be giving this a try let you guys know what I think so next up we have G pop so I actually on instagram we've got this sampler box for and I just paid shipping you get one of each flavor forgot to cancel it so it's send me a whole box and I haven't even tried on me on it but I don't remember I showed you guys this is right before nationals but here are the flavors cinnamon roll and I actually weighed this out so it says there's one serving per bag and there's actually two servings in here so bonus but you have to be careful because the macros are wrong same with the birthday cake I think this one's even heavier than the cinnamon roll and I'm used to are it's the same like actual what it's supposed to be chocolate lava and we have peanut butter cup so here's the macros pretty good macros for a nice snack but I haven't tried it yet and we've got a lot of popcorn last box this is actually shipment 1 of 2 and plus I went to the store the other day and got more stuff but here is a retired cent that's

everything has spoiled in here I have 15 meals and some of the meals are actually not even what I ordered lots of them are like 25 grams of fat and I'm like no that's like half my fat for the day so I'm waiting on new meals they're supposed to be shipping them out ASAP and they should be here Wednesday so we will see and hopefully this worked out because I was really excited to start a meal prep

and 7 protein just a sea salt flavor it looks like and I'm playing almonds and I share this a few months ago except had it forever it's a super berry honest a you just literally add water and you mix it and mix that stuff so well we will see what I think about that and then this I've also had for a very long time I've not been drinking so I don't really need this but this is for morning recovery you take it the night before you drink with your last drink so I'm supposed to hang out help with the hangover interesting if this does work okay so this is the most interesting thing I don't really know what exactly it is but it's a bar and fasting it mimics fasting supposedly so I don't know you guys can read that but I don't really know what I think so it has a lot of fat a lot of carbs overall or calories overall I don't know yeah it says like you can still be fasting even when you have this bar so don't really know what I think about that alright so this comes with the box every month but here are the if you can see that social media accounts you can follow them snack nation honestly I definitely recommend it I think when I set it up I can kind of like pick and choose like things that I like and they'll give me a box according to that I don't remember exactly but I love everything that I get and it's really exciting every month so you guys should definitely check it out

feel a lot more complete so maybe I'll do a house tour soon but anyways stay tuned for my meal I think it's ready alright here we are chicken with some barbecue sauce I'll show you in a second some lightly salted rice cakes with one laughing cow cheese wedge and everything about the bagel seasoning and then some sweet potato with my all-american better french toast it's so good and then I put some stevia on here sounds like crunchy a little bit of sprite butter and then here's the barbecue sauce I actually got this in Paris I think or Spain I don't know one of those places I think from Spain actually so yeah it's zero calories there are the calories on there essentially zero calories but I'm going to eat this and head to the gym okay so I got an airfryer I don't know if I share that yet with you or not yet maybe I have I don't know anyways I got an airfare a couple weeks ago and I loved it literally if $40 in Amazon there are thousands of like fours five-star reviews so good so I highly recommend an air fryer if you don't have one just cooking my soup tomatoes portion by portion in there they take I don't know anywhere from seven fifteen minutes each depending on how small you make them so my last batch I just made them like in tiny little squares and yeah it's so easy but anyways I am about to have a my pickle for pickle pump for the gym and headed the gym so I will see you either there or afterwards but anyways I'm gonna run to the gym because I have a lot I want to get done so I can relax and on my new couch tonight and watch a movie before I go to bed and fly to Denver tomorrow fly to Denver tomorrow I talked really fast when I'm really excited anyways I'll see you in a bit oh my gosh it is 5:45 p.m. and I'm just now getting home from the gym because I ran to TJ Maxx afterwards and then I went to Walmart to pick up some photos and sabotage and see to pick up a couple of protein bars and my ginger juice I love the peanut butter flavor they are so good but there didn't have any they had mango this time so I'm excited I think I've had no I have not had my I had the lychee likes you however you say it so I actually got some more pillows because I didn't think I had enough my couch is bigger than I thought so I'll show you guys what I got but I'm gonna eat right now because I'm so hungry I've only had two meals today alright here we have the next meal there are potatoes and 96% lean ground beef many cucumbers and the bananas with peanut butter so on the cucumbers I put some more of my iodized sea salt and extra chopped over some of this poppy seed Skinnygirl dressing and I mixed a little bit of the raspberry dressing in here as well same brand it's really good macros are so I have one tablespoon on here and then I am using the my brianne's blend peanut butter I have like all the flavors of this stuff it's so good so this is a ton of protein in there notice that and yeah so here are the ginger shoes this is the best brand that I've tried so far I've tried many brands and I get these from GNC and side note if you guys have not tried the birthday bash you should try it you either love it or you hate it and I love it so this is my third one and then I also found this cotton candy bias tea for I really like their energy drinks and I've never seen the cotton candy man flavour before so I'm excited to give this one a try but in other news my box just arrived let's open it up and see what's inside I am so excited and that's an understatement so we have the lemon chocolate cream I got an 18 pack of these because they do not sell in the mix and match and I really think that I like lemon so then I have my mixed box so if you buy two boxes you got the pumpkin pie bars free there's six bars in here so let's go and see what I have my mixed box isn't this gorgeous so here we have raspberry chocolate so there's six of each and mocha chocolate cream and then mint brownie delight so excited I don't think I've tried either of those flavors or the lemon I don't remember what I've tried but anyways as promised we got these six pumpkin pie bars free with the order of two boxes so excited to try all these out I'll let you guys know what I think on top of that I ordered these apple pie burner bars before they just went out of stock and retired forever so I've got 18 pack of that plus those those and my all my brand new pumpkin pie and then I got these as samples in the mail before they were released this week the peanut butter another pumpkin pie and and left over for my first box I'm the milk of chocolate cream which I have not tried but I did get six of those and orange chocolate cream as well all right so I went and got another pillow or two pillows and here is what it looks like in the light oranges color so I was like orange this greenish color and it's so soft so orange green and this grayish color cream beige I don't know like a really light gray so like it's very fall-like I love it I am so obsessed but yeah currently I'm going through I just printed pictures at Walmart it looks so good I took this in Paris so I'm gonna hang up some wall stuff and I will show you guys once I get everything done but here's what we're working with a bunch different stuff and I'm gonna move some stuff around that I already have hung up so stay tuned alright I am getting so tired I've literally just been on the go doing so much around the house and yeah it's time to eat again I've got two meals left but one's a little bit smaller so yeah I'm first of all I'm having my spinach shake I made this this morning I made my blender full of two servings so I have two per day and I will show you guys how I make that because I'm gonna make some for tomorrow and Sunday tomorrow Saturdays yes Saturday and Sunday to take with me on my trip and yeah I have a baked potato in the oven the airfryer so I can take with me on my trip otherwise I think I have all my food ready to go and should be a good trip because I'm going to Denver my home state Colorado Denver where I was born and Colorado my home state so yeah I'm really excited about like 22 hours or so right now I was picking me up at the airport so we are going I'm going to stay with her we're really excited about that I've just been on the go busy hanging things up and I think I'm gonna wait to show you until I do a house tour so but yeah here's a few of things that I'm going to take with me on my trip just my rice cakes and then I have gallon size bag more rice cake because you're all from other countries and I had some oats in here as well and then I also like to take these instant grits and sit back pick the instant grits definitely fluff up a lot more so I really like that but all right I'll show you guys my next meal and how to make the spinach shakes all right I'm about to give it the lemon chocolate cream and built bar flavor a try so I will let you guys know what I think okay so update I just tried this you can see so it's like a Milky Way type texture but the lemon oh my gosh so if you even just kind of like lemon a little bit I think you're gonna really like this bar because the limit is not overpowering at all and the chocolate and lemon the combination is just crazy crazy good like this is so good so so far my favorite flavor is the peanut butter it's a little bit higher in calories so these are all 110 calories that one I believe was 170 calories and it's made of real peanuts the other ones have no peanuts and at all so it's a little bit different but yeah anyways this one was really good and I think the mint brownie delight is my next favorite but yes they're all so good you guys need to try your built bars I actually have a discount code because I love them so much so my code is th fit and I'll have the link to the site in the description box so if you wanna order some definitely order some you will not be disappointed and it's free shipping ok so here's everything that I used to my spinach shakes I use the 50% less sugar so there's 13 carbs in one serving and actually use only a half of serving for each shake and then I do a little bit of almond milk like or two and finish of course I put it in the freezer stayin efforting puts in the freezer it makes it colder just a lot better but I take mine with me and put them in the fridge in hotels and whatnot so either way it's gonna be cold and then my secret is I add fruits and greens is pineapple flash splash Laver it's opted to and I get it from total nutrition and this is so good like I love just having this on its own but then adding it in my shake it just makes everything so much better all right so I have everything in here and I smash this down so much so if you have a weak blender don't smash it down because it won't blend but I'm add some water I'm going to blend it and then I'm add one more serving of spinach on top all right just like that we have four servings of my spinach shaped so this one is going to be for Sunday and then this one it's going to be for tomorrow morning so I can shake it up and have it in the morning it's already made and then I will pour this into here and have this tomorrow night so and the glass goes into shake here a second shake it up all nice when I'm on my trip but it's literally so easy and I just add enough water so it's nice and like light green not so chunky but yeah definitely try it let me know what you guys think and it's really good for potassium all right guys I'm just going to show you my last meal and close this video I am so tired it's 9:45 and I have not yet sat down today at all the whole plan was to everything done and to be able to watch a movie on my new couch but I'm so tired and I didn't even get to finish editing my vlogs I'm still behind my

reviewing every single flavor so stay tuned and then I got some new leggings so I'll be trying this brand in just a bit all right I have the collection completed until they release their new flavors but here are the flavors I will be trying and reviewing them for you guys later after I workout and before I fly so stay tuned this one is the s'mores this one is the coconut caramel cashew and this one is the Rory's Cookie Monster madness all right post-workout meal - I have ground turkey with some barbecue sauce green beans and then rice cake who's there buttered popcorn really good and then the everything bagel rice cakes these are just okay I mean I was expecting them to be a lot more like everything and it's different but they're more like the white cheddar which are good but nothing too exciting all right I totally apologize I've had to do a full day of eating yesterday and that went out the window so I just got back from my trip well a couple hours ago it's now 3 p.m. but I landed and ran some errands so I have a bunch of groceries I'm gonna show you guys my grocery called me that'll be a little more interesting I didn't need too much stuff so I kind of just got with my essentials that I run out of pretty much every like five six days or so and then yeah I went got a shake from Charlotte nutrition it is like an Herbalife shake place I know Herbalife is not really the best but their shakes are so good I haven't had many years I used to have one I said I'm all the time like six years ago so anyways um that I had the which the ice animal cracker shake and I was so good and then their tea was pineapple margarita very margarita e sour tangy side a little more water and it was really good but anyways I'm gonna show you guys my grocery haul and then a few things that I got in the mail from Amazon I'm gonna be trying a product and that big box back there it's actually really really big from the UK so I'm going to be unboxing that for you guys as well so stay tuned make sure to give this video a thumbs up and I will show you my groceries I know dunkaroos are back and I picked up a bunch at 7-eleven so I actually got these they offer like I don't know 500 thousand or something like that so that you're supposed to get them in the mail before they actually get into stores but I have not gotten mine yet so I found them at 7-eleven Denver's happy that I'm home and Tuesday anyways I have yet to have my dunk career I got these like four days ago from 7-eleven so I will be having them in a little bit I'm sure it tastes like sugar and cookies and goodness frosting so anyways okay so first this is all from Walmart and this is like my pantry items so I get half CAF coffee or I get decaf and like regular coffee mix them together because I drink coffee like all day so I love to have a half CAF so I'm not literally like hyped up all day so folder is just like you know your good brand so I realized I get to of like everything basically so my green beans I like the kind with the top thingy that you just slide up rather than using can opener because ain't nobody got time for that and I got some chickpea garbanzo chickpeas because I don't know if you're supposed to use it in the bag or not when I tried make my cojito I wanted to try it with some garbanzo beans to see if that makes a better different texture whatever I think it's gonna be a different texture but then I got some sliced carrots Oh what the heck only that's a total ripoff one has a thing and then the one does not that's not cool I got these because it's nice and convenient I did not realize that this one I don't have it anyways there's macros for the entire cans pretty good macros and then I'm really excited about this I did not realize that these are different as well this is Italian green beans which I prefer the Italian cut they're like the flat longer softer ones and then you just cut and they're actually seasoned so these are from I think they're made in North Carolina nope just kidding' Pennsylvania whatever I swear I thought it said North Carolina I'm just striking out today guys so this is with garlic and spices and bacon flavored stuff sounds pretty bomb and same with this one here the macros not bad at all zero fat only two carbs so yeah pretty pumped about that I don't know how there's no fat when there's like bacon stuff in here so whatever we'll give him a try I'll let you guys know what I think the cold stuff butter spray which is key to my life I don't know which brand I like best I'm this one or I can't believe it's not butter I don't know I mean they're all pretty good I like to make this with my grilled cheese sandwiches so I've you spray your toast or your bread and put it on the pan it makes it nice and buttery I promise you and then tofu I realize this one's open I don't know if it did that in a car or what but still gonna eat it because I don't really care I've been making my cinnamon toast crunch bites with these so I don't think I've showed you guys are through the recipe but if not I will so anyways I'm gonna make some of that and then honestly I prefer the Walmart brand of the alight Greek yogurt because there's actually like little berry and like saucy type stuff in the bottom I don't think it says on here oh yeah fruit on the bottom so we're really really good the blueberry is like my favorite and then I got some banana I don't think there's any banana stuff in the bottom but those are really really good and the macros are bombed too so there you go 9 carb 7 sugar that's whatever tastes good and then shout out to Anne Marie Lawrence she's on my team per physique team so she drinks as I see them on her Instagram story I've never tried this kind I wanted to give it a try because I say she's always drinking it but 10 grams of sugar does Lincoln fit that my records even if I just had like half of it at a time but some probiotics I think we can all use a little bit more probiotics in our lives and we've got some salad and snack-type things I absolutely love these dried blueberries and toasted honey toasted pecans like seriously look at that they are so good macros are they're not bad but you definitely wanna have more than one tablespoon at a time because it's really really good so that's what these are my salads or just eat like a handful and then also for my solids I'm a crouton freak I love croutons I can probably just eat them like all day just has a snack they're so good macros for these and then some chickpea snacks I've never tried the honey roasted I've tried like the sea salt I think maybe the ranch as well so I had like all of my stuff sweet I'm huge sweets eater so five servings in the bag about 50 chickpeas per serving not too bad for a snack I would probably have like half the serving of this and then some other things to me like popular or something um then I found this brand this is what I was thinking of I think this is made in North Carolina am i or am I just crazy no it's Georgia anyways we have some cinnamon pecans and here are the macros not bad I've been on a pecan kick I've been on like a nut kick and which explains these as well sweet maple walnuts I don't know if I really like walnuts maybe I do maybe I don't but it sounded really good I mean in the logo the picture it looks really good macros are really good as well so I will be giving these a try and yeah stay tuned for Aldi so I'm going to give this a try this is the sweet maple walnut they're pretty big alright see what I think mm-hmm oh my gosh that was so good holy crap the maple syrup very mapley I love syrup Wow very sweet cinnamon sugar maple II highly recommend it reminds me of I don't know like maple cinnamon toast sticks super super good I highly recommend these it's diamond brand and yeah I think they're on Instagram and Facebook too so you can find them there maybe order them online if you cannot find them in store but they're distributed in California so they should pretty much be everywhere for the most part they might be a new product so stay tuned and watch the grocery aisles for them I do recommend those all right here is my alley haul so these are my favorite English muffins I love them they're always really good really fresh and they're pretty good at macros 23 carbs for 120 calories and then I found these cookie tins I have not yet tried them but I'm excited to try them here are the macros for six cookies six grams of fat 18 carbs and probably not really any protein these are really really good I have tried these I've had a few bags of all the different flavors I think this is my favorite flavor the macros are again pretty good usually have like one two three maybe four the cookies at a time and then I've had enlightened therapies and they actually just start something that all do so pretty awesome the BBQ is really good and I've had their popcorn but I have not tried this herb and spice flavor so I'm excited about that only 35 calories per cup macros are good and then they have dog bones which Dan bear really likes got you a treat she's not too impressed anyways that was like 499 there and I'm a really excited to try this it's a sparkling bubbly white wine it's like 10 percent alcohol - and this is more like four dollars maybe something like that I've had their sparkling like coconut mango Seltzer drinks whatever spiked and those are really good way better than like the typical white claw whatever y'all get and I get my baggies and all that stuff there they're way cheaper I go through a lot of that um my almond milk I get that there as well they all taste pretty much the same spinach is like less than a dollar there or right around a dollar super cheap source salads carrots get my tomatoes there and that's all I got this time but usually I'll get all my fruits and all that stuff there they didn't know how much fruits so I didn't really get any I didn't get any but all right I will show you guys that box and just a little bit all right here's everything that was in the box I know it doesn't look like a lot right now but they put everything into these cute bags with their logo so I'm gonna unwrap all the bags I've already started but stay tuned and I'll show you guys the aftermath and everything that I got right here is everything it was a huge box and it was like nine kilogram some seven I don't know something like that so I'm just gonna go through some of this really quick so I got a few of their energy drinks one is actually just BCAAs this one is and then the rest that ones there are a little hundred and eighty milligrams of caffeine so not too bad that one is no caffeine obviously some protein crisps again I'll be going through all of this and reviewing and\u00f6 fit chicks make sure you're following that Instagram go fit chick and see what I think of all the products some of the news I've already had before and some I'm just trying different flavors but anyways I am trying this syrup for the first time sweet peanut butter tastes skinny syrup we have billionaires shortbread skinny sauce honey barbecue and barista creamer hazelnut creamer I'm excited to try that one and then I love beanies instant coffee so we got for the cake and then their new line is the wrist offend so I got the chai latte maybe I like cappuccino and fear their flavors um Steve I really like this got7 nutrition brand flavor drops this is blueberry muffin so I have these cinnamon roll as well it's really good and one more sauce we have a spicy bacon burger sauce so here are the macros pretty much a zero calories this is the same brand as the flavor drops as well and then I have yet to try these but I have a few of them already for my last box this these are oats mixes and then this is just a mug cake mix and then the flavors for example it's banoffee banana toffee I think that is I don't know speculoos and s'mores and then we have blueberry cheesecake mug cake s'mores and birthday cake and then here are the macros on here 2 grams of fat 10 carbs and 25 protein so really good macros on the mug cake I think that let's are a little bit higher in carbs yeah so we've got 7 grams of fat 38 carbs and 26 proteins so this one's a little bit more filling obviously and then different protein bars literally it got like that some of every brand the highest rated ones of course salty peanut caramel cookies and cream some chocolate only 187 calories it's pretty awesome really excited to try those this USN trust Brandt I had a cookie from them they are so so good I ordered more cookies over there but I'm trying their protein bars for the first time so these sound amazing and then we got some battle bites Mississippi Mud Pie that's a pretty popular one carrot cake I don't think I've tried that I think I might have some from my last time and then grenade that's always a good brand they're always pretty highly pretty high rated and then we have some misfits these are all plant-based and I don't usually like plain bass so stay tuned on my reviews they had some pretty high reviews so we will see and a PhD smart I like their brand I like let's see I've had this protein bar out of like the 21 protein bars I did last fall in a video last summer this was the best protein bar out of all of them so I got another flavor and then I got some more of their products and I'm really excited to try all of these yes especially the carrot cake I love carrot cake but for example the macros we have 10 grams of fat 23 carbs 15 grams of protein so I mean decent Macker but not quite as good as my protein pancakes I loved I actually just had this one this morning on the airplane there all of their labels are upside down not like the US so we have two grams of fat 12.6 carbs and 16 protein for these pancakes these are really good again those are pancakes as they're cakes so I don't really know what those are stay tuned and then some cookie dough these are both new I think they were I've had these water flavorings the Bolero brand really really good and I'm really curious about this lemon pie OOP bar down and then I got all these little samples like ginger elderberry banana cranberry so I'll be trying those well you guys know what I think anyways I've had this I have not had it yet but I've bought some of this brand before I hope I don't get the same flavor I don't even wear the flavors banana chunky monkey these are pretty big cookies I have no idea what it looks like or taste like but I was intrigued got another one 307 calories almost 10 538 protein or carbs and then 16 protein and then this Oh teen cookie was new looks like and then I've had this billionaire millionaire crunch before and I was in love they did not have the same flavor it was like a toffee salted caramel salted caramel toffee something like that before but they had this banoffee caramel so I got those and chocolate orange and hazelnut caramel but again that's that was literally one of the best protein bars that I've ever ever ever had these are all new to me I've never tried the indulgence protein C for example Belgian chocolate caramel I think this is the highest rated because I got two of them and then we have Bella bites so this is brand-new I guess I have more Bala bites over there this flavor is brand-new white chocolate toasted marshmallow I've had that cookie freaking bomb got two of a new flavor and then last we have some biscuits so I've actually had this before and it was okay I don't know why I got another one so

come lay down come you down lay down lay down no okay right here alright I am so excited to show you guys everything that is inside and of course try it on a can but make sure you are following me on instagram doe fit chick where I will do food you stack protein reviews and yeah I'll do lots of fun reviews so stay tuned and first of all these are the pancakes but I ride a cold months ago they were in my gift box from Italy and I literally searched and searched and searched forever to try and find them to ship to be with I couldn't find anything so I finally found this company and they have them so they have all kinds of different protein bars even have us protein bars like they have out right bar and plenty of others so I just want to get bars that I cannot get here in the US alright so let's get started so first of all I have a couple of protein chips that I got this one is youth it crunchers and smokehouse barbecue flavor and then this one is muscle move to mountain chips we have bank and barbecue flavor so be kind of cool to do a comparison of those two and maybe add in the quest BBQ chips and see how they line up with those oops so actually when I have my international day overs I have gotten that these be nice flavor coffee and it is so good it's instant coffee and this one is chocolate orange and then Christmas pudding I'm wanting to try this for so Christmas pudding one anyways this is the best instant coffee I've ever ever ever had and I'm about out of my current flavors so I'm really excited to stock up a little closer show you things so next up we have some fiber syrup I'm really curious about this I don't really know what exactly it is I mean it's syrup but yeah I'm guessing just bake and stuff with it I was intrigued so I got that it's like a bottle of shampoo and then we have a skinny syrup this is zero calorie of butterscotch flavor literally so excited I'm going to make something with this tonight and try it ASAP butterscotch is like one of the best flavors out there hands down so for the protein pancakes it's actually really really good pancake I know they're really low in macros to only 12 carbs for this and we've got 16 proteins to and half fat so there's actually like two pancakes and there's a filling on the inside so that one is caramel filling then we have peach jam blueberries or caramel chocolate vanilla and more blueberry so good I promise you guys you need to try them and they're even better if you put them in the microwave for a little bit maybe in the airfryer I'd be a little good as well so then we have some flavors we got candy and splash so this is Frankie's bakery straight in the bottle we have toffee flavor and marshmallow flavor and you can obviously just bake with it putting your coffee smoothies whatever you want another brand of flavor drops we have got7 Nutrition this one is cinnamon roll flavor sound freaking bomb and then the other Oh same brand but it's a different formula maybe not for me like I don't know this is that kilos flavor I think case that we have an airplane so good cookies are good I'm try that yeah obviously but so then we also have you up in brand trust purging routine still cookie birthday cake flavor and clean flavor super excited about that low sugar one point one gram okay vinaigrette through these this is cookie madness handmade the bad flavor pretty heavy big guy and flavors we have coconut frost monster delight creamy cookie come at the monster choc fudge brownie Beast these are really cute the packaging is unique and fun example of the macros it is 13 point 6 grams of fat 46 carbs and 1413 so a little bit higher on the carbs and fat side but it's a pretty big sized cookie so I think it's gonna be worth it and then this is another brand that I really really enjoy when I did my protein bar review it was the number one protein bar PhD smart is the brand and we have a white chocolate blondie and then a cookies and cream bar and then also have these little cakes the birthday cake and chopped cake we have 10 grams of fat 23 carbs and 15 protein so not too bad alright move on to a couple of random brands this is the protein works and loaded legends marshmallow chuck rock not exactly sure what course intrigues this looks really fun reminds me of the venture French it is way way brand ninety calories chocolate caramel cookie at coasters I mean that sounds really good doesn't it next you have battle bites which I've heard of these and I think that what they have in the US summer but I've never seen this flavor fasted carrot cake and I'm a huge carrot cake fan huge fan and for the entire thing it's only 110 calories 4 grams of fat 8 carbs and 10 protein I have a purpose ok there's two pieces in here that makes a little more sense for $220 for this whole thing alright I was like that's I should have got like 20 more of those so next up we have bar protein protein bar cookie some cream flavor it's by nano sets of the same brand that you get pancakes are from here fulfills brand vitamin and protein bar chocolate salted caramel flavor sounds really good and the texture feels interesting as well this is got7 Nutrition same as one of the drops and white chocolate krispies so it feels crispy sounds interesting alright millionaire crunch I don't know a millionaire crunches but I think it's something to do with karma lean as a salted caramel flavor 10 your Africa it's really interesting because in the UK they do everything per 100 grams and then they do like per serving so it's just their nutrition labels are different so we have 10 grams of fat 621 carbs and 15 protein and this guy and everything two different flavors of this crunch brand warrior unleash unleash hell I don't know what it's called warrior crunch warrior anyways we have salted caramel flavor and raspberry and lemon cheesecake flavor that looks so good we have barbells so I've been interested in this brand I think I've seen it somewhere else and lemon curd white chocolate flavor sounds pretty bomb the calories per bar seven grams of fat 17 carbs and 28 protein not bad at all for the mattress this feels really light 99 calories per pack skinny food Co and it's white chocolate krispies so it's like it's just a little crunchy chocolate little fight inside per pack it's 4 grams of fat 7 carbs and 913 nice little protein sweet tooth snack alright so I actually wanted to order a bunch of the flavors of this it's school some foods and they're in these really nice packages they reseal up and this one is they were out of like every flavor so I'm super bummed about that but this is be my Valentine protein BAE protein bar red velvet cake with hunky chunk Oreo pieces and smooth vanilla cream-cheese frosting dipped in sweet white chocolate and heart throb confetti like how good is that foun and how cute is that can't really see it very well but super cute let's check out the macro ten grams of fat 18 carbs and 2013 not bad at all no I love then you said can you sit she's not about this done very fit come here okay so last things we have mug cake mix and oats mix so this one is apple crumble and custard for the oats mix and her pouch we have 5 grams of fat 32 carbs and 25 protein that sounds really really good I'm definitely gonna try that pretty soon and then the mug cake mixes we have a white chocolate raspberry and chocolate brownie flavor I think that's going off of whichever one was like the most popular calories are per 50 gram and their 50 gram packets see 1.9 I'm a fat 4.9 grams of carbs in 26 protein so it very little carbon fat high protein mug cake super super macro friendly made with milk protein coconut flour egg white powder white chocolate chips and a few other things so definitely excited to try this out I kind of wish I would've ordered more of this stuff but I'm going to try things review them figure out what I like and don't like and order more and recommend things to you guys so again make

microwave arrives but here is my view nothing too crazy but so we are right by a huge shopping mall so I'm going to go lift found a gym that I can pay $15 for a day pass it's usually 35 but for the hotel that I'm staying at we get it for 15 so definitely a huge difference everywhere else I call it's like $30 for a day pass and like that's so ridiculous or a 35 30 or 35 I'm like what but anyways I'm gonna go to the gym it's only like 2 p.m. here I can't see it's not quite - it's almost to Tyndale - and then 2 or 3 4 5 5 p.m. East Coast time oh my gosh I don't I've been up forever I woke up at 4:15 Central Time this morning which is way early for me like yeah I'm gonna go to the gym and then probably walk around the mall cuz we are right by a huge like four five six storey mall and I went there like three years ago - two years ago something like that but I will take you guys along with me I'm going to take my tripod and all my gym gear to the gym I have bands bands oh my gosh I am so

step-by-step talking about the snow [Music] I am from [Music] [Applause] shines [Music] three fear [Music] [Applause] all right just left crunch and it was not the best gym I mean it was okay but luckily for the coronavirus luckily it wasn't busy I'm sure it would have been otherwise so I was able to drip food mini and shoe and I had my own space but really awkward so when I was leaving a guy went up and left the front desk I know that they're out of rice wipes and he's like oh well the cleaning people are gone so like really I'm sure you know where they are during a time like this you should kind of make sure that you're stocked and no matter who is they're not there someone should have the jobs do it but anyways my stomachs growling I'm gonna do a little bit of shopping I think and I don't know if M and eat my food or go to hotel but get 30% off of food and alcohol so I might have a drink but I might also check out a brewery or there's like a wine room here got a lot of calories left to eat like a thousand calories so it's getting kind of late but I'm gonna go walk around do some shopping sorry it's probably really loud but anyways hi I will catch you guys later set it fill my entire workout I did some bandage but hip thrusts as well and Calif press they're really good in for abs so anyways I will see your ass next alright just a little update so the bartender was a complete a I'm definitely gonna write a review on that I love writing reviews for Google but he was so rude so short so snippy with me and you know how I said that we get 30% off of food and drinks earlier well he immediate was like no no you don't so I'm like okay I was just asking like I saw on the paper it says veto and then I double-checked the front desk and then he's like well no you don't like just like making me feel stupid almost like you don't do that with your customers that was just the start of it and I don't know I'm just asking like if he any other like beer sir said it's Bud Light and he's like no just really short and I'm like oh my god so I quickly just had one beer and had Brussels sprouts and yeah that was it so I'm gonna have some chicken now and go walk around I'm gonna go to Sephora and Trader Joe's is right around the corner so just gonna kind of check out some things Walgreens I like to go to different Walgreens who I matter um so I'm going to do that and come back here get ready for bed and just kind of like hang out for a little bit so um what time is it now it is six o'clock on the dot so I'm gonna go and probably hopefully be back here by 6:45 or so and that's it that's the layover life of a flight attendant on layovers nothing too exciting yeah I always leave the hotel in the room my other flight attendants they're like I love layovers just get my room shut the door and do nothing I'm like what why oh it's so boring like I just wanted to sleep if I did nothing and then you won't be able to sleep tonight but anyways you guys

I'm gonna have a bottle of wine and just have a glass out of it rather than pay nine ten dollars for one glass of wine that way you can have however much you want but I had like five or six ounces of wine and then went to bed and I had two flights today with a like two and half hours sit in Dallas which means we flew there and we had to sit forever and before the Dallas the show that's like it

p.m. or so um so I just deadhead it actually I've been working so much I don't even know what day or time it is usually so yesterday I had a layover in LaGuardia and then I did headed back this morning but I'm since like 3:30 a.m. so I'm super tired and I doubled up on this trip it was a red flag trip yesterday and a red flag trip today so I'm getting paid time in half and working that crazy well it's really easy though just edited here I worked at Chicago tomorrow morning so it's like a 45-minute flight and then I deadhead back to Charlotte super easy but anyways mess willing to update you guys sorry I've been so terrible but I just feel like I'm flying so much and the world is just crazy nothing too exciting is going on just trying to keep up with life in general but I'm going to go to the grocery store me typical typical me but I guess there's a really really good grocery store right around the corner like I actually lived in the US for a while and he was like we have nothing like that in US and there's another store like bulk barn so there's nothing like that in the US he that's the one main thing that he really missed when he was living in the u.s. so I'm gonna go check that out and he gave me some coffee recommendations that are better than Tim Hortons and if you know anything about Canada Tim Hortons is very popular so I'm excited for that I'm gonna go explore a little bit and I'll show you guys what I find on how cute is this they gave us a little goodie bag with some barrier water some maple syrup and I'm most excited about these glazed nuts I haven't eaten these like crazy the Emerald brand they are so good so it looks like this is pretty much what I've been eating and yeah I'm really excited about this too though maybe I can find a sugar-free version at the store so the first thing I do when I get back to my hotel is lay out my uniform get my pajamas on the bed unpack my luggage of like what I need out for in the bathroom and put all my stuff in the fridge so usually hotels have refrigerators very rarely microwaves but they usually always have coffee but my hotel the other night did not have any coffee because they took it out for sanitary purposes so um yeah my stuff is all ready for tonight and tomorrow and I'm gonna go to the grocery store now oh one last thing I always bring a drawstring bag because it's so much easier than carrying a purse and for obvious reasons so I will see you later all right I just got back from shopping and gorgeous shopping and of course I got to the first like the best grocery store 13 minutes before they were closing but luckily the Lions were insane the lines were going down all of the aisles in the store so I was able to kind of like sneak around and like get a few more things before I jumped in line when they got a little bit shorter still stood in line for like 15 minutes though so it was crazy um all right so here is everything that I got and we're really excited one I cannot find these in the US anymore the tomato-basil ones and then I found caramel chocolate chip these sound so good and then I used to get something like this at high V just like the puffed things I don't know they had flavors at Heidi but this is just the corn and they had a wheat one as well they're pretty much like no calories so for a big one it's just four cards and then I found some mini butter popcorn and ketchup flavored and then so this is a flavor that's super popular here all dressed and it's like a bunch of different flavors combined I guess and then I've got some rice puffs Tara we might have this in the u.s. I don't really know but it looked good sound good and then some maple coffee because of course Canada a Smarties so I read up on a lot of these different candies and stuff before I came here to figure out what to get and these are really popular guess it's like M&Ms but better than M&Ms and we have coffee crisps another thing that I found to get crispy crunch oh Henry this peanuts fudge caramel yeah the Aero bars white and dark and milk chocolate combined and then crunchy sounds sound so good that's tied down toffee sponge I don't really know what it is but sounds are really good and then a bunch of different types of Kit Kat so we have cookie crumble and chunky caramel cookie dough caramel and matcha green tea and then the gold I don't think I've had the gold caramel is white and now I

growing on me the Walden Farms jellies and jams the Apple one I think is my favorite I've only tried a few of them but I really like the apples so I'm gonna eat this drink some water and I have a package on the step so I'll show you guys if it's anything exciting but stay tuned for the groceries like I said it's not too much though all right here is my haul that I got at Publix and all these so I got chicken and ground beef and then I got two bags spinach if it won the freezer already and then stuff for baking I'm gonna make something with this marshmallow cream and Atlas I don't really know what I'm gonna make but make something and then gingerbread is literally my favorite so I got a few of these gingerbread land little room scents and I'm excited I almost bought these on Amazon sweet and spicy chili rice crisps and sweet barbecue there are a bunch of other flavors there too but I'm gonna have these sometime I'm not gonna open them yet so they'll be fresh and more rice cakes because you can never have too many and some cucumbers and then I'm excited for these I don't think I've had this wild berry cream of the power crunch bar yet I'm not for sure and then I've had these waffles but I didn't realize that there's protein ones so there's 10 grams of protein all of these is the honey oat cookies and cream and snickerdoodles flavor and was really excited so here are the calories 189 grams of fat and 18 carbs decent amount of fiber and then 10 grams of protein so yeah these are really good I highly recommend them actually I've never tried those two flavors but I've had this flavor and I don't think add protein in it one huge positive note I have enough protein for the next eight days so through next Tuesday I am set for my protein really happy about that I just need to cook the rest that I just got and then I am good to go so that's a huge relief but anyways I'm gonna show you guys what's almost UPS okay so that's the only thing that's really worth showing so I got this stevia peppermint cookie I'm really excited to try this I'm probably gonna try it right now new headphones covers because mine are completely trashed and some tights for flying and then a couple of Christmas presents so yeah I'm gonna try this now okay this is embarrassing but this is out with the old I've literally had these for like I don't know however long I've had my headphones it's either been three or four years and I cannot remember so go from ratchet to brand new and surprise surprise I can actually this is like more noise cancelling now that they are brand new and closed around my ears what the heck I've been doing with my life hey guys okay I'm about to pack for Iowa and I'm really excited so I'm going to show you everything that I have I music stops you loud so first thing first here is the body wash that I've been using with a vino just oil-free body wash so I've been using that and just trying to scrub really hard and then I've been putting this coconut coffee at body cream illusion on and it smells so amazing I'm really happy with this so I have except my shower products and then we'll go tanning so I do my own protein every one's for my last competition that I bought new bottles as well so I have plenty of protein and then I have a couple myths and then I have my admits from last time as well got some contacts in here because I don't wear my glasses onstage so I actually have prescription contact so I can see that's this one I get tired it's really hard to see and then I saw their hair stock bikini buy and some extra makeup some Clorox wipes never know when you need those and then I brought all of my makeup so ton of competition makeup more makeup more makeup it's all like it sees stuff so it's really fun because first of all if you have not heard of epsy it's one of the monthly subscriptions and you get lots of really cool products so I love taking these with me to just have really nice like lotion moisturizer primer foundation eyeshadows all that stuff so um and then I also have my new mascara which I got from Valentina from Italy when we did our box exchange and then a little few more things I have a baby powder so if you are new to competing or you don't know about this don't know this about competing when you sweat and you're nervous put some baby powder on because you should not wear deodorant you kind of smell a little bit so it'll help a little bit just a little bit though and then I got razor I use men's razors personally because I feel like they work a little bit better but that's just my opinion God my condition and it's box always stays in here and then a trick for toilet seat is aluminum foil so I put these out in strips and I'll be singing my parents out so I make sure I don't get my tan on their toilet protein is usually pretty good about not trans transporting trans I don't know I think I've know what I'm trying to think of but I don't know the word anyways transpiring um anyways aluminum foil that's what you need and then I also cut hold and cups so I can pee through them it acts like a funnel got my pee cups and some pump up bands and also I have for my tan about my tan and chill just a big comfy black loose-fitting thing that's the over my tan because you don't want anything too tight around your wrists your arms your anywhere so you can ruin your tan and I also have my roll physique shirt I don't know if I'm gonna wear it on show day or not because I don't want to ruin it with might and even though I don't think my tan is gonna run it but anyways I'm bringing that and then another thing that I always do is bring the slippers keep your feet warm I just wash or I didn't just watch these I wash them after every competition give me your feet warm it's key to having

Josh Kincaid Capital Markets analyst and host of your cannabis business podcast today we're gonna take a look at a report from brightfield group on the trends for budget products today's podcast is brought to you by the great outdoors so according to bright field group their budget price category features unaffordable items which seek to give consumers the best bang for their buck so as the cannabis market is shifted and matured the sorts of products being offered at this price tier have become increasingly varied especially as more companies seek to appeal to customers who spend less during their dispensary visits from a retail perspective it's incredibly crowded at the value level there's a lot of competing brands that have low price so the higher you go and price the less competitive it's going to be but there needs to be a reason there has to be a turnover right there needs to be a reason for people to go and buy those things so have an infuse canna gar $420 is only gonna sell if you have a limited release maybe quarterly if that so we have seen high item prices that do turnover but there needs to be a reason some of the reasons we see for budget items is somebody wants to try something with a low overall price point so pre-rolls in Washington are a perfect example we sell more pre-rolls in Washington than any other state one in five basket orders has a pre-roll in it making Washington one of the highest for that and I think is because people want convenience they also want low price yes we'll want to try different things we have seen a trend towards smaller packaging sizes in Canada they only have ten milligrams so Washington State they have about 100 milligrams broken down into ten ten milligram samples or serving sizes so one of the more significant trends in the budget category is decreased product size as compared to the more expensive products many items in the budget tier offer lower overall amounts of THC but at a proportionately lower price point I've had this kink in my neck for several days so I went out after I got a massage the other day and got a hundred milligram chocalate it's broken down into ten individual ten milligrams so got to open up all of those and eat them didn't really do anything didn't really give me a high I think it helped me sleep a lot better super hungover you did a lot more car than normal but I only spent sixteen dollars on that so I could have walked out with a pre-roll or something else but decided to tip the guy four bucks we're seeing some flavor preferences changing or maybe just kind of coming to the surface with 20 million layoffs there's a lot less disposable income out there so as people are maybe a little bit more concern about disposable income cutting back on top-shelf stuff it's kind of opening up doors or avenues for trying other things so the opportunity right now is for a lower entry point maybe a lower dosage amount overall smaller package smaller pricing point we can also see that in beef jerky with the the price increase in beef jerky the size of the packages are a lot smaller instead of $10 for a pound you're seeing $10 for 8 ounces so people are getting creative with smaller packaging sizes taking a look at some of the products that are leading the way vape carts and cartridges you can see a half gram and 1 gram cartridges and I'll throw in tankers as well to refill those those are the syringes we were seeing some of those 1 gram syringes as low as $18 now they're as much as 30 I don't know if that's because the competition has gone or that particular producer figured out that the price was too low either way there's gonna be a lot more vape car chewing at sea in places that still have stigma like a medical market like Arizona for example they're gonna want something that's incredibly discreet not selling so much pre-rolls that we do up here in the northwest the more vape cards my buddy Jason Lammers at 4:20 wholesale pack has these vape carts where you can put two cartridges in the same battery so that's nice if you want an indica or sativa or THC and a CBD by the way I see that there's gonna be a lot more innovation a lot more opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs to have a lot more products and ways for people to consume the carts aside from the typical of pens edibles are definitely selling during this pandemic you're seen as some of the trends in edibles with hundred milligrams of total THC in each product the biggest disruptor in quarter one twenty two and budget edibles is a mini dark chocolate product has managed to hit a price point of under $10 by decreasing the toy teetsi concentrate 250 milligrams so it's a little on the expensive side $20.00 400 milligrams is is more than I want to spend even 16 dollars was more than I wanted to spend in order to make cannabis something that people buy on the regular whether it's CBD or THC it has to be comparable to traditional products so a soda selling at $23 I mean no wonder that olala went out of business in Washington a soda company you can't sell $23 sodas and think that people are gonna come back and keep buying those so I'm seeing anywhere from 10 to 15 cents per milligram so 10 to 15 dollars for a hundred milligrams is gonna be or should be the going price moving forward we also saw tinctures on the rise with trending with this brightfield report they pulled out Mary's medicinals team sure that has a thousand milligrams of THC in each bottle it's about a $50 price point that's actually pretty good I spent about $98 for a thousand milligrams but it's also a trusted brand the report ties the popularity of this particular t-shirt to the value and the lemon-lime flavor I'm not sure the lemon-lime flavor is the reason why it's selling so much is probably because a thousand milligrams based on from what I've been asking some of the CVS Rite Aid Walgreens you bar tell little mom-and-pop pharmacy places it's the thousand milligrams so they're looking at the highest milligram at the lowest price point same thing people are doing in THC markets asking for what's the highest he see at the lowest price point top two things that is always the same for purchasing decisions is pricing convenience it doesn't matter what what they're looking for and especially with something like CBD even people don't really understand the difference between broad spectrum full spectrum and isolate you know you want something that is a full cannabis extract oil or a full spectrum problem with that though is is you can't guarantee that there's gonna be 0.3% THC or less you can test for it but it's not always going to be a guarantee so for somebody that's going to be selling across state lines or internationally there's more risk to that personally for me I'd rather go into a store and find a one-to-one CBD the THC ratio for me that's the best ratio for my neck pain I've been using from zone in CBD capsule as well as the tincture I'll use a tincture in the morning and then the capsules at lunch or gel caps mmm I'll also use edibles when I need them very rarely but I was really bad the other day so I went out and grabbed some dark chocolate I mean he's just like this hundred milligrams and t-shirts throughout the day as I need them also vape I've been using a THC vape in as needed I'm smoking on a on a hemp blunt right now just because the pain is significant but each to their own I don't dab a lot but when I do I use the vape exhale so the nice thing about the vape exhale is that you can adjust the temperature and also it has a water feature so little water bong here if you like or just a straight glass tube either way concentrates are definitely leading products for trending and popularity California always leads popular items whether it's strains or categories about six months after they're popular in California Colorado will pick that up in about three to six months after that Washington will pick that up and so whether it's the cookie strains that are all the rage or concentrates it's definitely popular in California likely because the category delivers a punch at a reasonable price so brightfield group is highlighting raw garden they have some dough C sauce and some cookies sauce both I've seen master distribution growth over the first quarter 2020 so it's available in one gram packages for as little as $35 sixty five percent THC so in California wit first rolled out that was twice the price it was 60 to 70 dollars for a gram so anyone who came out with the business plan thinking that they were gonna get that long term obviously it's been cut in half already you know a year later alright so brightfield groups trending low-budget products as concentrates tinctures edibles and vapes so we're also gonna do another podcast about the five ways that this quarantine has changed the cannabis industry forever have to look for that with that we're gonna pull this one up I'm Josh can keep this is the talking hitch don't forget to Like share and subscribe [Music]", "-OOByL1Prfs": "it was a best rookie I'm going to take paper over 5150 tendo's to the face I have to say these are my favorite I haven't tried the black bar yet which is supposedly a thousand milligrams of THC this is 500,000 milligrams to see kana seems excessive that's a lot that's a lot okay the neck this video but hey now I recommend a stimulant of some kind I have a Vietnamese coffee now whenever you're gonna the reason I like kirova is because they balance out their their THC with CBD so while you're gonna get 500 milligrams achieve see you're gonna also get six milligrams of CBD now if you didn't have the CB the six milligrams of CBD the majority of you would lose your [ __ ] if you didn't pass out from the high amount of THC majority of you might have an anxiety attack or a panic attack like you guys seen the YouTube video when I when the cop calls and he calls 9-1-1 he's a cop and he's under - Brown is about freaking out that's because he didn't have the CBD to balance out that THC it's kind of like God's little safety net if you will a lot of people think that Grover edibles have a canvas taste I don't really like them they don't like the taste that's stupid look why if you just go to Safeway Safeway just go to any supermarket go get a thing of fresh baked brownies if you don't want to taste I mean come on it's ridiculous tastes like just regular non edibles there's gonna be some work you didn't watch meet you definitely if you're not lactose intolerant definitely want to take this with some milk well well I can't say I don't move you can see the oil reserves are definitely not dry I probably shouldn't eat before ingesting this we goes at three minutes all right and apparently kirova is on Facebook I've liked him there on Facebook oh drop son dogs gonna get that and it says right here on the back you can always eat more but you can't always eat less so remember that 5150 now the 5150 goes for anywhere from eighteen to twenty-two dollars depending on where you get it I got a diversity Ritter River City Phoenix so it was twenty dollars typically that's the average price for a 5150 bar now the first time I had a 5150 bar I split it with my roommate and she she freaked out she did not she didn't make it we split one of these down the middle and she did not make it in fact I even had a little bit more than she did she did not make it I recommend that you not eat these on an empty stomach especially first timers if you've eaten edibles you eat edibles all the time working you're full of [ __ ] blah blah blah then yeah neck this was nothing in your stomach and you're gonna be like that scene from the Titanic with the girl and then Leonardo DiCaprio is holding her empty stomach but if you do not have the intestinal fortitude the testicular fortitude I wouldn't recommend it damn I really hate this not directly after eating there but what are you gonna do other edibles that I've tried that I do like various gummies goomy's the gloomies I have one the other day from the green door I think that's the name the green door collective I'm not sure but I got a gummy booming it was a 100 or 150 was like 12 bucks I ate it that's what you do but I have to say with the gummies the effect is fast the effect is much faster than you would you would typically see from a cookie edible for sure those of you that might be asking later yes that's a 420 alarm clock Ben hmm I'm beginning to feel its effects for those of you that have eaten edibles at some point and get this weird life it's almost like that pre psychedelic when you when you take the psychedelic right before it's affected kick in you get that feeling of like you know when you're in a rollercoaster you guys scratching in school and the thing starts that's what I'm experiencing right now we're getting ready to go please leave me comments down in the comment section below if you liked my review of grow the edibles and we're gonna start doing these every other day if not at least once a week you're gonna mow branch out into maybe dispensary reviews in the California area in Northern California area see how those right now this is a chore for me to eat because I just ate dinner it's so stupid of me I should have like not even dinner came home snack this and then eat dinner because this is like a it's it's its effort to take this down it really shouldn't be it's moist soft it's just me it's not you kirova it's me I recently just going to watch and eat this yeah you are definitely definitely starting to feel the effects which is weird cuz it's been 9 minutes but right there I definitely got a my body telling me hey whoa what was that excuse me it's your body here something going on strange don't know what it is Christopher Walken is horrible it needs work out we'll work on it anyway this video is getting long in the tooth throw edibles the 5150 if you can handle it if you can take it maybe you can take try and in the comments down below let me know your experience all right guys it's WYD wookie signing out", "RHHL3JV0Ajc": "[Music] good morning and welcome to today's video so I am actually in the lovely it but not so lovely Charleston right now and I say not so lovely because it

watching me and I hope you guys enjoy the video tomorrow is my check-in so stay tuned I might be attaching that's this video otherwise will be the next video sorry the sliding it to me terrible but I thought I'd give you a little French tour and as I like get my boring stuff ready for the morning so first of all I'm going to make some coffee and got these cute little water bells for the coffee and I'm also gonna chug a bunch of coffee because I like to get in about 20 to 30 ounces right away in the morning as I have you make my coffee and then I also take my supplements so I've got my little baggie here and I have enough for an extra day in case I get delayed or stuck somewhere and then I also like to refill my bag of salt so I have a little baggie and I have my 1/4 teaspoon so I measure that into a baggie every day and I add that to my food throughout the day so that my sodium is completely consistent I'm shooting for certain number in my fitness pal so I'll add a little bit more if I need to to make up for my like goal for the day but otherwise everything is consistent I don't salt or Susan anything as I cook it so this is just when I might deepen a prep though like normal life I don't because that's just I like to have my food seasoned right away because take an extra step or if you forget to season that something like it's just like you don't want one season meat that's for sure so anyways here is what is in my fridge it's more water and then I have my spinach shake so I always put it in a blender bottle so that you can easily shake it up with the blender net and then a bang because I would probably take this to the gym today my spray butter usually comes with me as long as there's some room in my lunch box and today is refeed day so I have multiple servings of potatoes I cooked in the airfryer and a cheese wedge just in case I want a little cheese my life and one of my built bars this is the apple pie flavor it's the burner bar which they discontinued so it's retired but all the other bars are absolutely amazing and a half a cucumber because I love cucumbers and means it's like my only source of vegetables besides my spinach shake and then I've got some turkey bacon for breakfast this morning I did not make eggs and usually I'll make some eggs for breakfast as well but I just did not do that yesterday and then I have a 93 percent ground turkey and then a bunch of shredded chicken and I made my crock pot and then for my lunch box nothing crazier stomach chocolate silver or salt pepper stuff in there chocolate which I have not been having and I bring my instant grits because like I said before I like the instant grits I feel like they fluff up a lot better and just spray on them snacks which I have not been having oh I have a ginger chew every morning with my supplements as well and then I always have an instant coffee because you never know when you need some coffee like last night this really came in handy and then I got my liquids TV as well which I will put in my coffee this morning I got this on Amazon much cheaper on Amazon and and here we just have more instant grits guys you're all alone and then pretty much a sponge of tea in here so I've made this caramel yesterday with a some sort of Apple one and it was really good like it was eating a caramel or drinking a caramel apple it's super good then in my tote I will bring things like my all-american nut butters I also have the vegan pumpkin one over here vegan pumpkin delight almond butter it is really good and it's I think it's a limited edition one I'm not for sure but it's really good I highly recommend it so also in here ice I recently got these on Amazon I will definitely be using this today for leg day and got my suit in here usually have my heels somewhere and this is usually stuffed with rice cakes but since yesterday is a low carb day I didn't need too many and I have plenty of potatoes for today so I have just a few rice cakes left in here yeah I'll just stuff whatever other food and stuff I can put in my tote so I don't carry a purse anymore I just carry this tote alright so now I am in bed so after I've had my water all of my vitamins and supplements my coffee is ready and I'm gonna get back in bed and have my spinach shake drink my coffee while I answer all my clients emails that have come through overnight in the end in the morning and then text messages as well that they've sent me and I try not to open my messages until I fully have my attention if I hate having messages like that I'm gonna put the notification but I don't like to open them and forget to respond when I'm like busy so it's just like a it's a tough thing but anyways I would really like to start being good with a planner and a calendar so if anyone has any tips on that I always like to buy like fancy calendars or planners and I'm like yes I'm gonna start doing this and like organizing everything but we use our phone so much for like calendars and notes and stuff so it's just like how do you switch to back to that paper like I really enjoy using paper but I forget to do it and I don't know so if anyone has any tips on that with me before me let me know please but I'm gonna have some coffee because I still need my coffee so my brain can function and so I can talk but anyways spinach shake is bomb make sure you try if you have not tried it

sugars just protein bar I'm gonna try from Italy from Valentina it's a white chocolate protein bars so it's a wall oh I don't know white chocolate stay tuned alright here's what we're looking like Wow okay this is so good it literally tastes like white chocolate like I'm eating like a big block of thick white chocolate but was like aerated bubbles throughout I don't know it's weird is it like a narrow bar door and airborne no it's not a narrow bar I don't you to try you try and he'll give the history of you as well all right he tried it and he had to actually try it twice I prayed twice because it's it's very different and how when you bite into it it's like a wafer almost but then it becomes very if you want to say airy in the middle and then as the if you want I don't know is it actually white chocolate will say that because that the taste is quite charming as a white chocolate melts in your mouth it becomes very creamy and all like chalk would be like in a sense so it finished it off very well so for me like the very first couple bites starts off very different but then it finishes like almost like a candy bar I guess like white chocolate candy bars in them so I would give it like an 8 or 10 bro boy oh my gosh no I'd give it like a nine point three four five out of ten it is really good it's a way different it has like a big blocky texture and like you bite into it hard but it dissolves really smooth and it has a really really really good taste to it like it literally tastes like I'm eating like white chocolate chips white chocolate bark what are we gonna call it oh no it yeah Allen white Allen Burke yeah I don't I really like it so yeah I'm definitely excited but I like it too I think she's just way too nice hundred times no everything's inane I've tried so many protein bars like I know how to review my stuff so anyways I'm gonna finish this bar and call it lights out so anyways thank you guys so much for watching stay tuned for more [Music] I just got home it's 4:30 on Sunday to all of these packages I'm really excited looks like this one is from Italy it's my Christmas package oh my gosh she said it's like six kilos or something

mean it's almost do some right now but finally everything's changing and it's really pretty alright guys I'm going to be a super lame and closes video out now so I just wanna say thank you so much for watching the video I hope you enjoyed everything all the behind the scenes and I didn't kind of film as much as I wanted to but I was really trying to like live in the moment and enjoy everything and I literally had such an amazing time last night after margaritas and some Mexican food we went and had like a get-together at one of the hotels just like a small group of us I was really fun to spend time with the team and just get to know everyone and yeah I'm excited to do it again I'm exciting it judges feedback and see what the plan is going forward but I'm going to get ready for a power lift you need I don't know when the meat is gonna be I need to look up all the front-- meats and yeah just really work on getting my strength up and grow a lot of good food Thanksgiving this week and yeah I'm not gonna go crazy I am pretty strict and like set on my reverse diet and I mean I'm gonna allow myself a little something here and there if I want it but basically I'm gonna stick to what I know and what my body likes and just go from there but anyways um thank you guys so introduced video you make sure to give it a thumbs up and I will see you in the next one [Music] [Music]", "D--AfKOBJB0": "[Music] what up y'all that [ __ ] came to me how y'all feeling today man [ __ ] today we gonna do a little review about these Smokies so I got a little edibles something for you but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] the [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that thing so you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] if you dig in the turfy shirt go over to counter me calm yourselves terpene shirts can survive 10 11 12 13 14 maybe it's a minim [ __ ] man I got some new designs actually that I'm working on so it's gonna be some new [ __ ] coming in I'd say probably Annabelle maybe give it two weeks three max but I got some new designs on [ __ ] with so I'm gonna get that [ __ ] done so uh anyway man Smokey's I it's a pretty good edible from what I've heard I don't think I've ever had these and if I did I might have had a sample but I don't think I've had any of these to be honest with you man but people come in I got this one cat he'll come in and he'll get no joke like 20 of them were some [ __ ] he gets like a [ __ ] ton of them and a lot of like older people like them a lot of ladies like them but also here a lot of dudes like man um motherfuckas tastes good you [ __ ] around and eat all of them so I think that's a pretty cool thing the flavor I have right here is the blue raspberry so it's more of a fruit chew versus gummies and the reason this is a fruit chew I think it's because it's vegan so it's kind of hard to get like vegan things to be like gummies so usually they'll use like a agar powder or something like that I'm not sure what this one used sugar and corn syrup though they use pectin okay yeah so it but it's hard to get it to be like more gummy so it's more so of a chewy type thing so still good though you know and they also use a distillate in it for their infusion this one is actually I think there's a slough pack if I'm mountains yep Wow pack this one is a lau pack so they get their flower for the distillate from from lau pack Smokies has like different I guess they're sponsored by different peanut sponsor but they're flour is produced by different companies depending located so they have California they have Oregon I think Washington and I think Oklahoma working yeah so I think it's like Oregon Oklahoma Washington and Cali I have a Sam in Cali so I got the Lao backward it's only 20 milligrams I'm 20 milligrams the 20 calories per [ __ ] gummy ten milligrams per gummy 100 milligrams and the whole goddamn package so I guess that's pretty much it man I mean that's the most we could say I heard that they use real fruit with it it says natural and artificial flavoring so you know not sure what all that means like I say they're gluten I mean they're vegan and they're gluten-free and I believe that's it let's open it up hopefully if he's ain't all melted to get okay man oh that is been in my closet so hoping these [ __ ] like me just one big mesh or mesh ball all right so circular about the size of a quarter roughly so [ __ ] man they also be having like sour flavors and stuff like that but this is just a normal Flav so let's make this [ __ ] happen dude it's to ten milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD per serving we got to talk about the CVD so anyway man that's it bottoms up [ __ ] and [ __ ] gets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah I can see why comes our bomb honestly these are probably the best companies I've had that are infused I doesn't think these AVX gummies that I had before was probably the best or now the Kaunas is pretty good with these [ __ ] right here hang on front these guys are vomits [ __ ] dude yeah these it is it they get these right to it don't you just disintegrating you know in your mouth yes it is like it's digging it is chili he did they think these things are bomb Victor's life is normal but again you need the plug around to eat the whole bag of these [ __ ] yeah man so mm-hmm this isn't good now someone asked me how come I don't do like how I feel on them and how effective they are and things of that sort there's a few reasons why I do that and I think I've explained it on a video but I'll explain it on this one too the reason I don't do that is because eight how high I get has zero to [ __ ] do with you hi our tolerance is different so I could say oh I took 30 milligrams and I didn't feel anything you could take 30 milligrams and be on the [ __ ] moon right I could [ __ ] around and take 40 milligrams be like man I'm high as [ __ ] you can take 40 milligrams and that fella goddamn thing everybody's tolerance is different so it's to me it's a waste of time to sit here and come back two hours later and be set my camera back up boy okay that's how I feel because everybody's high is gonna be different I just think that's like a big [ __ ] waste of time as far as I'm concerned and then also I don't think it's fair to the company like let's say I hit I eat something and I'm like I didn't really feel anything from it but yet I've been smoking weed all day or something like that and then I said I didn't feel nothing I mean you [ __ ] don't go [ __ ] with them all over I just had too much weed that day and it didn't affect me so I don't like [ __ ] what other people's companies and taking money out they Pike it over [ __ ] like that so that's why I don't do that if it was a shitty tasting gummy I just wouldn't do the review like I wouldn't release it like that was my first time eating that [ __ ] is good but if it tasted like dog [ __ ] and feet I just wouldn't [ __ ] release the video but honestly that should have actually really really bombed so I definitely say if you can find some Smokies go look for that [ __ ] of your own one of those four states I mentioned Cali Oklahoma Washington and Oregon definitely go get them shits them shits a really really dope you can check them out on a website and share the things just Smokies calm and the Smokies would Izzie so it's not a half Smokies so I'd definitely go check them shits out man but I got to give it to him the [ __ ] badass so uh this weekend I'm gonna pop like four or five it [ __ ] and see how they do but I yeah man [ __ ] I got a lot of cool [ __ ] coming I got a gravity bar i'ma show you [ __ ] a [ __ ] so I'm just getting some [ __ ] together with that but I got some cool [ __ ] I got some hash then I picked up man I got a lot of different [ __ ] that I got now I got iced up with all kind of different things so of course I'm gonna show you share that with y'all so anyway man that's the end of this video y'all make sure that y'all love each other keep the love going be peaceful to each other keep the peace go on go over to Canada mink on get yourself some terpenes shirts that i'ma holla let you [ __ ] a [ __ ] ass later I'm out this [ __ ] peace [Music] we in a jungle smoking legal", "t-Mf78K0KKo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hey guys and welcome to today's vlog so I am doing a daily life of my pregnant sister sister-in-law so stay tuned and I hope you guys enjoyed the day I'm just gonna going through the daily as she would eat the foods that she does and do the things that she does so I have my breakfast right here first she starts with some coffee I'm in the morning so I had some coffee and then two hours later she has her breakfast so here is what she has pretty much every single day alright we are making some toast with peanut butter and I have my all-american birthday cake peanut butter I love all American if you guys have not tried it make sure to give it a try one of my teammates actually has a discount code it is Kay bliss Fit KBL is SFI T and you will save some money on your order and then she also has some honey bunches of oats I got this new frosted kind with some milk and you guys know I'm gonna use my almond milk so stay tuned for the final product all right cereal is done finishing my toast right now but I'm actually gonna have some protein so I'm gonna have my MRE a light this is the gingerbread cookie so I'm gonna have this and I actually have to go to the vet Denver has a fat appointment and like 30 minutes so we're gonna take off here in just a bit I will check in with you guys and a little bit later I back from the vet and somebody it was a scaredy cat shaking like a little leaf the whole time hey but you did good job right girl oh yes do you guys want to go for a walk you wanna go for a walk okay let's go all right we just got back from our walk and I completely forgot to mention I actually got my eyebrows done yesterday so I got the micro bladed and so if they look a little funny I'm taking care of them right now so yeah I'm going back in six weeks for the follow-up appointment to get them retouched filled in and changed to my liking if I have any thing that I want to change about it so overall I really really liked them and it was a great experience it didn't really hurt me I actually fell asleep during one of them when choosing this one her hands over my nose so I was like hard to breathe so I'm like practicing my breathing whenever she'd go away I would take a huge deep breath in so that I'm very claustrophobic so I felt like I was really constricted um anyways we just got back from her walk and part of the thing that Ashley likes to do for her 30-minute workout is clean a house another option is 30-minute nap or put your shoes and socks on so clearly it takes there quite a while to get her shoes and socks on and she considers that a workout so I am going to clean I have some laundry going on right now I'm just going to clean the kitchen vacuum the um not forego the Roomba just got done doing it's hour and 45 minutes sweeper on the house so I'm just going to touch up on that and yeah that's about it right now but she has her snack I'm a little behind on her feeding schedule but I did wake up a little bit later than she does so I'm kind of on track I guess you want to say so I'm gonna have a smoothie right now I'll show you guys what is in the smoothie and then get to cleaning all right here is the ingredients for this fruit smoothie the only thing I'm missing is frozen fruit but I think I have enough carbs going here so I'm gonna do some banana she says peach yogurt orange juice milk I'm using almond milk handful spinach and then the fruits and greens mix so here we go and of course I'm gonna add some protein so I have my MRE light strawberry shortcake and time for the taste test so let's go ahead get rekt smells really good I think the peach yogurt it's awesome touch dang that is insane the peach and the banana I'm not getting too much of this Strawberry Shortcake protein which is what I used and this is actually not quite cold enough for me I usually use frozen spinach and I forgot my spinach to be in the freezer I'm gonna add some ice cubes and let this chill for a little bit but it's definitely a bomb drink I think adding a little bit of fat some sort of coconut oil peanut butter almond butter something I think that was a completely topic but I will just save some spats for a snack later on because this is pretty much like zero fat in here alright a lunch is up next so take a look at this beauty I am so excited to eat this so for lunch she typically has a salad of romaine and spinach mixed salad with pecans dried cranberries apple feta and vinaigrette I do not have a dried cranberries apple edit or vinaigrette so I have a honey Dijon dressing I do have a blueberry and spinach dried mix just a blueberry and pecan mix it's so so good I got it from Walmart and then I also added some tomato cucumber red and orange peppers and I think that's everything but I'm going to take this run a couple errands and go to Starbucks because Thursday's at Starbucks is happy hour buy one get one free and Grande or larger and I'm going to park it and do some computer work so a little bit blah a little bit about my sister-in-law Ashley she is my age for both 30 she is due February 24th and she's having a little girl and she works from home she's a graphic designer freelance designer and yeah she gets to work from home it's a glorious life my brother is a professor at k-state self yeah that's what she does so she works from home I kind of work from home too besides being a flight attendant so I'm going to take you to a coffee shot because I do my best work there it's really hard with the pups back

work now so stay tuned and I will see you guys at the coffee shop alright I feel like I'm about to throw up slash pass out I have a terrible migraine and I've been having blurred vision for the last few hours when to Starbucks did some computer work but I have literally been struggling I cannot concentrate very well everything is taking me probably at least 50% longer because I cannot concentrate or like remember what I'm doing oh so I am going home and I'm going to take something for my migraine and go to sleep I feel like so terrible right now anyways I do have another snack supposed to have Ashley has a either Wheat Thins and she has Wheat Thins and sharp cheddar I think but I have this gluten free a little pretty much air puff snack and then where are you where are you I don't know where it is I have one of the year wedges like I said I literally cannot think right now and I don't know where it is laughing how she is wedged and Ashley has Wheat Thins and sharp cheddar cheese but this is what I'm gonna have so yeah I'll have it when I get home lots of water my headache medicine and then take a nap so stay tuned for whatever else I still have dinner on another knack but we'll see where I'm at with my macros I feel like I'm pretty low oh I did have messy monkeys my I look like ascetics I think cinnamon an apple apple cinnamon and I had some oh my gosh we really couldn't I think this is so frustrating and pistachios I had pistachios literally couldn't think of that anyway it's okay I'm going home now I'll talk to you guys later [Music] [Music] all right as you can see I have a couple of deliveries and I want to unbox them and go through them with you say what I got so I am getting five monthly subscriptions with twisted foods so they send me 15 different meal combinations so I get actually 12 meals seven three snacks with that and I love it so it's my second box that I got and the food quality is literally so good it's like restaurant quality the portions are huge and the macros are on point they actually talk to your the phone and go through macros with you they make sure that they are sculpting the meals to foods that you like and the macros that you are looking for so most of mine are little bit higher carbs and kind of lower fat because I'd rather have them like around my workouts so stay tuned and let's see what we have um by the way if you want to order go to the link in my description box and if you just fill out the questionnaire just mention my name and you will get 20% off of your order and I promise you you will not be disappointed

during the shipping process which is awesome and a super super nice touch and then it is actually frozen with this single-use only yeah super frozen and it's I guess it's like stronger than ice but I don't really know what it is so anyways that's what it comes with and stay tuned [Music] all right so I'm just going to go over everything and tell you what it is and what the macros are and yeah let's start with that so far it's looking like everything is completely different from my order two weeks ago and it's honestly it's a surprise for me because I know my macros and my goals and the foods are literally surprised which is the best bar I think you're not choosing foods like you're not choosing the standard meals that you do from pretty much any other meal prep company they give you foods according to what you like and you're just not foods are you just like so anyways here we go all right first we have chicken with jasmine rice and squash it is 371 calories eight fat forty seven carbs and twenty-eight protein actually have like 0.32 so it gets very very precise macronutrient profile we have chicken salad with sweet potato fries and zucchini I guess I can show you even though it's frozen stuff gonna be adds pretty but still is pretty darn pretty calorie it's 260 55.4 fat 29.8 protein carbs 25.1 protein chicken with yuca and squash I don't really know what that word is why you see CA 347 calories 7.5 fat 42 carbs and 29 protein looks pretty darn good and then we have a bourbon meatball with brown rice and green peas 414 calories 8 grams of fat 49.7 carbs 30% and we have pep cheesy bread pepperoni cheesy bread I don't really know this must be one of the sacks I'm assuming maybe no maybe no I don't know 342 calories 17 fat 15 carbs and 30 protein this looks pretty darn bomb scene with coconuts the first ingredient so it's more like a keto type not really keto but you know you guys get what I'm saying and we have breakfast peaches mild cheddar plus 30 carbs so we have 209 calories 7 grams of fat 16 carbs plus 30 carbs and 14.3 protein this looks pretty darn good for a breakfast pizza and next up we have caramel white chocolate protein bar and looks like there's a frozen banana in here as well so protein bar and a banana buddy had a not too appetizing looking but as it happens with frozen bananas so yeah I'm gonna frozen mini in our hands then we have turkey mr. potato and zucchini I'm huge fan they're sweet potatoes I've had before it's so good I hate the skin and everything 359 calorie is seven point back forty three point seven carbs and thirty point five protein turkey with soup to new kini so another one of these which I am totally all for that because like I just said I love the circus I love the turkey and the zucchini as well chicken feta bacon with white rice and green peas 387 colors seven fat 43.8 carbs and 30.9 of protein and we have chicken with diced white potato and green peas this thing is heavy guys like it's literally so heavy and like the portions are huge and amazing 459 calorie is seven fat 65 and thirty point three thirty two point three proteins awesome for a post-workout meal definitely great macros for that spider cheesy spicy chicken with diced bright potato and squash for 42 calories 6.2 fat fifty eight point nine cards and 34 point for protein again another perfect post-workout meal unless we have turkey roast with white rice and Asian stir-fry 359 calories seven fat 43 carbs and 26 protein like I said those pre post-workout marker ratios awesome see this one's broken so I'm going to put and a new container so that's why they give them to you some people aren't complaining there's nothing to complain about and we have couple more things all right extras we have blueberries and raspberries and it's literally just starting point eight carbs and we have baked egg looks kind of good Oh eat with fruit I like how they give you instructions and they write it on their hand and everything okay so one egg whites two egg whites in here and then we have baked oatmeal banana rolled oats egg whites that sounds really good she gave me numbers and I forget okay so baked egg with fruit you guys are about to die on me okay anyways you guys get the point this stuff's good legit go check it out he will not be disappointed and more box for today I might have some chocolate assortment there were these puppy treats candle these sentiment hearts I like my favorite facemask and those things these things are like my favorite but they are so high in calories [Music] [Applause]", "5fGUKlpmXV0": "[Music] here we have peach hazelnut resalable packaged nice that's something you see very often in this industry that one's good definitely white chocolate can taste a little bit of hemp but not too bad that's good raspberries and cinnamon pretty cool that one's really good this one the dark chocolate is really good and don't get much of a hemp taste at all on this one cleanse my palate it's caramel coconut drizzle um got kind of a happy aftertaste but coconut flavor is dead definitely get the pen flavor right off the bat peppy meaning grassy kind of a taste but not too bad caramel is pretty good dark chocolate really deep cacao oh my God my glands are like and swelling up Ellen's so dark chocolatey pretty big like I haven't flavor towards the end of it but pretty good for the most part you'll like that one but I have to be like ready for it you have to know how to eating like Thai chocolate peanut butter and honey see I like that one I think the honey flavor add something to it I got like a really strong peanut butter and honey flavor and then a little bit of ahem kind of an aftertaste that isn't the greatest but the honey and peanut butter is really good though no I've talked to all my Tevas alright next we got sea salt strawberry that phytase the sea salt I don't think sea salt supposed to go with strawberries supposed to go with like caramel usually I like stuff with salt in it but a little bit of a ham taste again towards the end mmm pretty strong cupcakes or is the end but like the strawberry and the sea salt flavors you've got the white chocolate definitely very happy I don't want to be rude but it was bad the first time I tried it but then trying it now it wasn't too bad [Music]", "Fd-iCpWciOI": "[Music] hey guys so I'm really excited to

consistency and then I've got two slices of turkey bacon that I'm gonna have plus a half a rice cake and 1 tablespoon of almond butter all right here is the final product a lot of eggs little rice cake and two perfect little turkey Bacon's okay this is gonna look really gross but I just made my spinach shake with cocoa powder so it's like a brown green shake but I mean I had some stevia to it

right don't mind my tiredness I am so tired it's not 11:15 so Cheers it's not all that bad um hi dad is serving at a half of my spinach so I think it's a little much on the spinach side and it kinda tastes a little freezer burn so maybe I need to store the spinach in the freezer a little bit better but yeah it's not that bad really I don't really like spinach so I don't know I'll drink it [Music]", "Lro1likeOxo": "hi there this is captain Murdock with boots viacom I'm going to review the CBD hemp oil extract tasty drops or the tincture drops version of the CBD hemp oil I have a video already on how to do the vape liquid which is basically you put the liquid in an electric pen and you vape it that's a whole different type of way to do this and then you also have the pure concentrate oils which comes in a syringe or tube like a paste and i have a video and an article article explaining that as well the paste or the pure oil is going to be the purest the most concentrated for more severe health consume conditions that you might have and then you have the taster drops which the teamsters drops are great for in mind from what the feedback I get from my own experience they're great for anxiety sleep problems inflammation things like that and it's great if you have a high-stress life you can take them with you if you have a meeting if you have something stressful going on that day you can take extra with you it's real easy plant it tastes good of course so I'm gonna explain how to use this the first thing is you just shake it up you open the ball it's it's a got a childproof lid on it that actually makes it really nice for putting in purses because then you don't have to worry about it accidentally opening up and making it a mess in your purse so there's a couple different options here you can either count the drops 15 drops under your tongue or you can fill the whole dropper which is what most people do and what I do just cuz it's easier than counting and you just squirt the whole thing it is you can see the drop here you just squirt the whole thing under your tongue it is sublingual and if you put it under your tongue you have capillaries under your tongue so that you can quickly absorb the nutrients in strain in your system by bypassing digestion it makes it bioavailable which is really big for people who have weak digestion but it just gets you maximum efficacy of the nutrients right so you want to hold it on your tongue for 60 to 90 seconds to give it time to get into your system and then wait 20 or 30 minutes if you don't get the results you're looking for which most people notice something for sure especially with a dropper whole but if you don't get the results you're looking for then take another serving take another drop purple it's not gonna hurt it's just food everybody needs something different some people do need a couple fold droppers and if you find that you need something even stronger like if you notice results with this but you need something a little stronger that's one you might want to bump up to the pace right so you can do that and then the other thing I recommend is taking it on a regular basis consistent consistently that will really maximize your results as well because it gets in your system so if you have for example I noticed that as I took it I was taking it to help me sleep better and as I took it on a daily basis after about two weeks of taking it before bed my sleep cycle really regulated a lot more than just the initial time when I started taking initially I did notice results but after a couple weeks the results definitely were better results overall so it is people ask me can I take it on it as me the basis you can you're just not going to get the same result so what I recommend let's say you're taking it or stress or anxiety take it every morning or afternoon and then if you have an extra stressful day take it again the drops tend to last they can last you know five to six hours or something so you might want to take them with you to take a second serving in the middle of the day if you have a high stress day some people last all day on just the one dropper pull so again everybody's different but if you need help deciding what's gonna be best for you please email me at foods that heal you at gmail.com or give me a call I'd love to hear from you I have a lot of information on my website and I will put links below this video for you have a great day thanks", "0gUKYB_pb6o": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the

believe these were $12 so you know not that much I'm so well I guess relative to 112 milligrams 120 milligrams milligrams milligrams milligrams boy Wow I forgot what I was trying to say what I'm trying to tell you is you're gonna like these if you pick these up there may not be the cheapest hundred and twenty milligram edible that's what I was trying to get out of earlier but they are damn good heartily recommend them boy I do they're good so thank you so much for watching weeds guys I would throw this at the camera but then I'd break it and then that would be sad so I'm not gonna do that but I am gonna tell you I'm kind of like George Michael from Arrested Development when things go astray I just kind of turn my back and yeah thank you for watching wheats we'll catch you on the

"hello senior stoner fan just the real senior stoner back at you for a comparison of opiates vicodin to edibles and during the comparison discussion what i'm going to do is give you a peek behind the curtain if you will on how senior stoner manages his pain with less of these more of these which means edibles versus opiates here we go first of all i have to say that what's happened is i've been able to take my opiate use down from fentanyl patches 75 milligrams to one vicodin a day three time four times a day and sometimes i don't have to do that and the reason i've been able to do that isn't because they've solved my spinal condition isn't because i've been able to be operated on they've all refused isn't because i've been able to have the spinal stimulator oh well your pain changed mr senior stoner it's not going to work now carry on well i didn't take it sitting down this was all happening during pandemic and you had to wonder how was he able to survive you survived with the love of mrs senior stoner and you survive with the love of your family and the love of sugar and you all but you survive by finding a formula to conquer the pain and make you in control of the pain as much as possible you can't do it with all these because with all these you'll stop going to the bathroom you'll yell at your family and friends you'll have other complications you know what i'm talking about those of you who use these okay so how do we take these and use less of these i'm gonna take four vicodin for vicodin and put them on the table here in front of you all why okay there's four of that baggie there that's a day for senior stoner instead of 75 milligram fentanyl patches by the way did i tell you it was in addition to 20 milligrams of the lord of the day which is morphine essentially now down to uh you to some people this is very strong but i'm down to four vicodin a day how how is that possible unless if i really try if i grip my teeth or if i'm using alternative methods and that's the key here what is the alternative method what i have found isn't something i cook anymore okay it's a way of looking at it a way of measuring it a way of using the edible a little bit here and a little bit there instead of bang like that okay no sledgehammer you don't want a sledgehammer that's the first thing you need to understand you want a graduated effect you want to be happy dude and lady you want to be happy we all do you want to be out of pain but how do you get out of pain we can't get out pain got to get happy how to get happy you got to find something that makes you sing find something that makes you go find something that makes you move okay a lot of times unfortunately unfortunately because doctors have a lot of things it's not going to be these four pills they operate in the background it's like an aspirin what i've done is i've found nirvana two things blackout brownie and animal crackers you're gonna go what is he talking about well it's a thousand milligram blackout brownie and a package of seven pieces of 50 milligrams each animal crackers they're by the cookie factory i'm sorry i can't tell you where to get them how to get them i'm sorry a fairy drops them off here i'm sorry you know in the air a stork whatever but what i want to talk about is how i use them okay put any of your edibles that you can get in your hands here's how i use them forget the brand 350 which is five seven piece units seven five seven fifty milligram units one one thousand milligram brownie well i've tried eating the whole thousand milligram brownie and i almost didn't wake up it was unbelievable i got the shakes the shivers you know what it was crazy so what you need to do very simply a company called corova used to include a grid on how to cut it because what you have to do with this brownie if you have to take it out and score it you're going to say what do i mean by score well this already comes 7 50 milligram pieces so you can take it as you need it i take one or two a day depending okay but my primary edible is the blackout brownie and how i do it is the following way for you guys simply you're gonna measure it take a tape measure and it's gonna measure roughly three inches square three inches by three inches so what am i gonna do i'm gonna make tic-tac-toe out of it essentially what you're gonna do is you're going to cut it into 10 equal pieces you're going to say why why because you want to take it with you let's say i'm going to put away my pills why because you might want to take it with you number one why because that way it's pre-measured okay and it's easy that way you put it back in there and you have the pieces well that's really the textbook way to do it i'm gonna tell you guys again under the hood i'm giving you a picture a look behind the curtain i don't do it that way okay i take it as i need it and sometimes i'm off that's not good which means sometimes i haven't had enough and sometimes i've had too much there's a sweet spot it's like with a tennis racket or with a golf club you know what i mean when i say sweet spot so what you're going to want to do is you're going to simply want to cut this into the piece that makes sense for you everybody's going to have a different size piece they want okay i usually start with about 1 10 1 9 of the unit and i go from there so for example i'm going to cut a piece about this big you'll see i go on the corner and i cut careful with the crumbs this is very powerful stuff so you can't even leave crumbs around for children or pets i'm serious about this don't take a chance don't leave it around if you have a cat so here's where it comes out you're going to joke and say senior stone you're going to be kidding me that's about 1 12 1 12 1 10 yes it is okay because you can always add more with an edible one of the bad things about edibles is you can't go back and give it away oh i had too much sorry you got to wait it out so i recommend you start slow do not i repeat do not eat a whole thousand milligram brownie and think i'm a strong person it'll be fine don't do it so here it is right here all right the rest i put back in now an hour from now i'm going to reevaluate i'm going to say gee do i need more now part of the day today remember what i say before it's about being happy i said part of the day unfortunately with this storm i've been very stressed out which doesn't help pain but i would like to go watch tv and relax with sugar and sing for mrs stoner when she comes home so this particular brownie the blackout browning is as it says it is it is extremely strong wow i'm already feeling it believe it or not this is a little different feeling i'm almost gonna say it's sativa versus indica strong indica with a hallucinogenic element but the animal crackers are a nice enhancement animal crackers candy coated covered with the little sprinkles are really tasty excuse me for eating and the effect is going to be like a wave now you've put these two together so what i've learned to do and what i hope you all will learn to do with your edibles is take your time know what you're doing but know what you're doing you know what i'm saying it'd be a shame to have all this knowledge that we all have about edibles and then cut it in half and take 500 milligrams and think all's going to be cool because i'm going to a party it won't be cool all right somehow it's the way this brownie is engineered it's too strong layer in something like this which is a little bit of a pick-me-up it'll have a hybrid effect is what i would call it and now you've woven in two of the best things i can think of to keep yourself happy the whole discussion could have been framed would you rather be happy than in pain well do you have the secret way to do it you're looking at the stack of how to do it and i have the stack here and it's important you're looking at the stack for the right reason it's not because i want to show you my inventory you've seen that before you can see my you've seen my inventory not because i want to show you all the packages because i want to show you that i have a lot of them more than this and then i can control myself and that's the key you need to have self-control success with edibles success without a self-control equals success with edibles okay you know a doctor gives you a prescription the vicodin take one a day senior stoner uh four a day one four times a day okay or up two they gave you the prescription it's not on here in these packages it has ingredients it does not tell you how to take it it says seven servings per container on here probably because they wanted the package to be the same my point is that's 135 milligrams that's a lot for a person who hasn't had inevitable before for example so your individual use your individual judgments maintain your individual tolerances measure it out just like i showed you use a grid make your own template if you have to and remember it's very simple you want to use more of these and less of these this is the real senior stoner have a great day everybody if you thought this video was good please subscribe cheers", "INGue0fpEaA": "[Music] hey guys what's going on it's a girl I'm back cuz Queen and I'm here with another review a product review and today I'm doing one of my favorite things in the world I'm gonna review one of my favorite things in the world chocolate mmm chocolate and today's review is on Hayes and Maine and this is actually a milk chocolate and when I saw that it was one to one CBD and THC I was all over this of course as you can see it says 250 milligrams and then it has I think it says 34 percent cacao for milk chocolate that's pretty good and like I said one to one CBD THC and the 250 is 125 milligrams of CBD and 125 milligrams of THC so per piece per piece I'm going to get 12.5 CBD 12.5 THC which is you know 25 basically milligrams but the reason why I wanted to try this is because normally and I've said this before at this stage of my journey since I'm starting off I'm still a newbie I'm starting off pretty small as far as the amount of THC I try to consume I generally try to stay between 5 and 10 this is 12 but I'm hoping that because it's a 1 in 1 that the CBD will offset the high filling of the THC because this is more THC than I normally consume in in edible I'll just say that so and I should have haven't had we chocolate before so this is a new one for me like a chocolate bar cuz this is Arizona by the way my house is pretty cool but uh it was like a hundred and I don't know five today alright so that is what a serving size looks like and again I'm gonna tell you when it comes to edibles listen this chocolate board you're gonna want to eat the whole thing okay okay and what edibles one of the best ways to consume them I'm gonna get this out of my hands because they blow milk with edibles they tell you to hold it in your mouth and let it know I don't want to say just all but like what chocolate of course let it dissolve but like when you're doing oils and things like that hold it in your mouth awhile and kind of let it get into your system I'm really trying to you know it's good okay so I wouldn't to me is not there to try to compare it to something like the Hershey bar or something like that because I'm pretty sure it has a higher the cow example but I think it's very good I mean I think it's very good chocolate there is just a a back note like a under note of the cannabis but it's it's I mean it's it's almost not there it's very mild and maybe because I know that it has cannabis in it I'm picking up on that but I think if you just gave it to somebody and they were just eating it they wouldn't they wouldn't pick up on that but it's actually really very good and that's again I tell you guys that's the thing about edibles when they're very good like that you're you're more apt to pick up another piece because it's like you're not really even thinking about it you know is this unconscious thing to continue to you know don't want to consume something delicious something good and before you know it you're like you know 10 sheets to the wind and you're trying to remember why and so with this chocolate is very good yeah that's it's very good so I might if I feel any any differently or if someone notices me filling in you know a little bit like who I'll do a reaction video after this just to kind of let you know how about ten twelve point Bob didn't mean [Music] it's something that I would I mean I said this a lot edibles are not cheap that candy bar probably cost about 12 bucks for a candy bar yeah it's like normally you can go get a candy bar for a dollar you know 50 cents or whatever but we have to realize that this is also medicine and so you need to compare it to that and not compare it to something like a chocolate bar because at the end of the day when you're comparing it to actual medicine you know that it's a completely different story right so we have to be careful how we you know frame it but as medicine goes yeah that that went down pretty good so alright guys that's Hazen main milk chocolate and I like it I do alright guys I will talk to you later alright bye hey guys hey listen I just got through in a fish sandwich just everything's good but yeah they had me needing a snack yeah it was good very good chocolate and that was great for a while and I tell you again the edible is that I'm not I'm not going to talk too much right now you just have to be careful and I only have one square I don't understand how these people be putting back you know so much damn weed Oh anyway yeah [Music] you [Music]", "jcAIiBbzrLs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which of course means edible uh an edible brand we've looked at many many times one of my favorites it's been a bit of a rough week here at wheat's hq in the world at large um southern california is burning the sky is orange outside of me i felt like i really wanted that edible that i was sure was gonna do the trick so what did i go with today an old favorite an old classic let's take a look at good old kiva again that's right one of my all-time favorites kiva manufacturers of the wonderful chocolate bars the little terabytes and even some excellent gummies uh not too too long ago they've branched out got some new fancy flavors out there including one of my favorite flavors period good old mint chocolate chip um it's a love it or hate it flavor i'm a love it kind of guy and i thought you know the world's burning let's do some kiva so uh this is as i said a kiva chocolate bar of 100 milligrams of a thc uh mint chocolate chip flavored picked it up for a uh respectable 21 at my dispensary which is more than average for the edible there for sure uh not too much higher than their chocolate edibles definitely higher than the gummies uh but kiva is a product uh of exceedingly high caliber so uh it is usually worth that slight premium uh so let's go ahead and get this 21 chocolate bar open we've got some very elaborate directions on how to open it here cuba seems to have quite the process uh so let's figure this out uh one press on flat surface tabs to unlock cool two well this is a flat surface two use finger to slide out three pull open oh that does not feel like that is uh [ __ ] it too stupid oh wait maybe i just have to take the sticker off didn't it say to take the sticker off but you know oh god damn it do i hate all these pieces of packaging ah there we go just rip it they make so much great child proof packaging but what they don't realize is when you make childproof packaging you also make idiot-proof packaging and while i am not a child i am definitely an idiot and i don't like being treated like a child but i don't mind being treated like an idiot um yeah how do you get something that's child proof packaging that's hard difficult to open for children but still oh my god remarkably open you know not difficult jesus christ wow that was a hell of a lot of effort i don't understand how that was even supposed to work it was glued at the very bottom like to the package oh well take that into account when purchasing this uh don't take this somewhere you need to open it discreetly uh boy okay so here we go here is our kiva th c 100 milligrams infused chocolate bar uh nice and green like mint chocolate chip so uh if i'm correct it's gonna be five 20 milligram little pieces in this bar yes yes yes oh wow there's some like real minty chunks on the back there so this is what our bar looks like or at least half of it the other half's broken in there uh five milligrams each of those little rectangles for 20 in total for 100 milligrams and all and like all our wheats reviews we're gonna review the entire product not just the taste i'm gonna eat all hundred milligrams of this probably gonna take me about an hour to do so it's a lot of chocolate looking forward to it and then two hours after i have that last bite i'll come right back here to you guys and let you know if this kiva is as good as it's always been but first things first let's give it a try um little known fact but the k and kiva stands for quality because this is some quality chocolate wow nice dark oh man i'm a dark chocolate fan which is weird because i don't really like bitter things but dark chocolate is excellent and kevin makes an excellent dark chocolate bar that has virtually zero weed taste mostly just great dark chocolate nice peppermint aftertaste mmm hmm manquila is one of those um rare rare rare rare edibles that the fact that i've only eaten like a quarter of this at this point is actually like oh well that sucks i'm almost out of chocolate because it's just good to eat chocolate like i've said this before about cuba i would have eaten this for pleasure if the with that at the exact way it tasted right now even if there were it was not going to get me high i wouldn't pay 21 dollars for it but it is just good quality chocolate and a good quality high i hope but to find out for sure i'm gonna have to wait a bit until these uh effects come on i've got some more chocolate to eat and uh i am very excited to see how this is gonna go it's already brightening my day up in these apocalyptic wildfires so uh to some degree already mission accomplished but i'm really really excited to see what comes next i hope you guys are too i'll be right back here to hang out with you in just a bit to give you our wrap-up thoughts see you then [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about four hours actually since my first check-in with kiva's mint chocolate chip bar four hours because i lost track of time got pretty sleepy got pretty high um just totally totally forgot all about this which is the sign of a quality edible many hours later i was like oh [ __ ] i forgot i was supposed to do this uh and i am still very high many hours later and uh may even indulge in a nice nap now um another just big thumbs up from kiva mint with their mint chocolate chip bar i suspected it was gonna be good i'm happy to say they're still great they still make quality products wow um this is a really nice four hour high as i said high enough that i totally neglected to do the most important part of my job uh but i'm glad i'm back glad i remembered i'm glad i could share with you guys the great experience i had with this kiva mint chocolate chip bar uh so anytime i have a product that i like this much i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that isn't necessarily weed related you don't necessarily need a weed to enjoy it this week i definitely use some weed to get a little extra enjoyment out of one of my all-time favorite shows i don't think i've ever cherry on topped it anymore but while i was quite high i indulged in a little um a little television comfort food and one of my all-time favorites party down the two-season wonder on stars of all channels back in the late aughts uh like 2008-2009 era i think um a little uh 20 episode two season comedy about a catering crew in hollywood at california um with a want a bunch of wannabe

then stay high stay healthy dog coming in we'll see you soon", "aSO-ZBoJ0DQ": "I am gonna be eating one of these very excited these are like hair on that there's these are CBD gummies and I already opened it says here it's a full spectrum organic cannabidiol l-theanine Piper myth this something or others some other thing that I can't pronounce and some other thing that I can't pronounce no THC and no marijuana but my body hurts I don't want to get high so let's try this what's in here oranges in a red so this orange one also tiny look at it can you see it mmm Harel serving size one gummy ten milligrams per gummy let's see how I feel later hello everyone so it's been a little while since I took the gummy and maybe I would say like 20 or 30 minutes but I am like super tired right now and I think it's only 8 10 p.m. and it's too early to go asleep but I think that I'm gonna brush my teeth anyway because just in case I fall asleep I don't wanna like fall asleep without brushing my teeth because that's just weird and gross but I'm gonna try to stay awake for a little bit longer but I don't think that I will be and I will be super upset if like I go to bed soon and then wake up at like 4:00 in the morning or something but tired alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "vUUdcfQdc_Y": "thank you for joining us on help with answers I'm Matt ours or four lung cancer survivor and patient and I'm here today with dr. Ross hammock and we're going to continue our conversation about CBD THC marijuana and how it is used in lung cancer treatments can we start with talking about how it can be used what it's good for and maybe what's still not proven as for symptoms or a possibly a curative approach so it I mean we said there's THC and CBD so the CBD tends to work best for the symptoms that we associate with cancer and some of the treatments for cancer so it works for lack of appetite can work for insomnia it can work for anxiety it can work for pain I've had some patients that be able to come off their opiate painkillers that can work for nausea the thing is it's just a drug though I mean it works for some people and just like any other painkiller or anything else it doesn't work for everybody so it's it's just another tool in the armamentarium that we can use okay the THC has pretty limited medical role I'd say I mean there there are people who've pushed the very high THC form so there's something called Rick Simpson oil sure has that treatment for cancer and I think there's a tiny bit of truth in that but if you think about all of the developments in lung cancer it's all about personalized therapy so why should there be one treatment for every kind of cancer it doesn't make any sense and I think that's just wishful thinking okay so if someone was interested in starting to use CBD or THC as another tool in their lung cancer treatment yeah how would you want them to approach you and then let's also talk about how they can go about getting it where they should get it from and then also how they should go about using it you know methods of edibles smoking and vaping or what's the best options out there so in states where it's legal for both recreational and medical as in Colorado I mean technically you don't even have to go see your doctor you could just go in and get the stuff recrea recreationally the different recreational medical is the price it's essentially the same stuff or the same range of things that you can select it you go the the medical ramp you go to your doctor and I don't prescribe it I don't get out my prescription pad and say you need this and this dose and this often all I do is fill out the details so you can get an ID card so you can get the reduced price sure I mean my biggest worry though is then you go into a dispensary and somebody who may have no medical knowledge may really just be up to speed on their recreational aspects is then the person saying oh yeah you need this one yeah sure what are some things we still don't know about CBD and THC and its uses well I mean I mean it's a really long list so the the fact that they're I mean this is a natural product there's an analogy that's a bit like saying you know your doctor says you know you should have some alcohol and you go into a liquor store and they say the doctor said I should have some alcohol what should I get and the guy behind the things that you want beer do you want wine do you want liquor or whatever so we're kind of at that state you know which strain of marijuana do you take how do you take it generally speaking I would suggest you take something orally you know I think smoking it bathing it is a bad idea these are very sensitive tissues in your lungs it can be a solid gummy or a candy it can be an oil which allows you to be very sensitive you can't get it as creams but that's the only gonna be an issue of guilt like an achy joining the the other things we don't know is you know what dose do you take how often do you take it sometimes these things can get into your system very quickly ones that the oils tend to get in quicker some people even rub it on their gums which get into their system very quickly but if you do that if you don't or if you don't know that aspect you can overdose really quickly you know a one square of the chocolate bar I think nothing's happened 20 minutes later I eat the rest of the chocolate bar and then two hours later I'm completely stoned so all of this is unknown and desperately in need of study definitely what about drug interactions if someone wants to find out if the treatment they're on the target therapy they're on how it works with with marijuana where should they go for that information or who can they ask well what we're mostly worried about is when two drugs and marijuana is a drug are tab alized are broken down in the body in the same way and they're going to interfere with each other so they're either going to increase the levels of one of the drugs or decrease them and so the best place to do is to go to your your your pharmacist in a Cancer Center and say look I'm thinking about starting this I'm already on these treatments is that okay and I think that's the best place to start but it goes back to the idea of you know don't do the experiment in this weekend and then tell your doctor that you did it say hey this weekend I'm thinking about going to see a dispensary the first time what should I look out for okay perfect do you have anything else that you want touch base on this well so here's my question so have you taken marijuana I have many many years ago obviously not as a treatment option okay but I think what what I really like is that you answer that question directly and this has been a sort of taboo subject for a while and if the patient asked me have I taken marijuana I smoked it once it had no effect I was on a canal boat with some friends who's stoned out of their head and I was the one left driving true story there then you know you have to be able to address it upfront without being awkward about it sure and that's what maintains trust perfect okay well thanks for your time and thank you for joining us on hope with answers", "whhItvbC65Y": "all right so we're gonna go live in a second here but before we do uh the title of this video was what jeffrey did we call it cbd the best the best cbd oil oh that's what we called it that is correct all right so i gave you a video a couple days ago or last week uh and i'm gonna give you another video last week i kind of like read some of the stuff that cbd does i'm best i'm just saying what it does for me so i'm going to give you that if jeffrey feels like he wants to jump in and say what kind of stuff cbd does cbd does so obviously i'm hyped up i'm hyped up because last week i did my reset week and so kind of timing it's cool when timing or things just work out in the right spot so this cbd thing came about in a very unique way and i got it and then i tried it and then i went into my reset week and i really used the cream a lot is what i started with and then i kept going going and going but uh what i liked is that each day i felt better next day felt better and by the end of the week not only physically but mentally because anytime you're physically hurting it messes with you mentally it does i don't care how strong you are mentally if you're a key and all this um it plays with your mind and and obviously serge is not here today and kind of explains you how achy it kind of got to me so with that being said is that too much job is that going to make the cut yeah it's going to make the cut so that's the reason why i want to say that today and and just tell you what i've been doing is that um at night so i work seven days a week we do me mo jeff um because we love what we're doing and it's fun and it's cool to see how things are going and all the people we're impacting so let's let's get the other side and let's just focus on the people that are maybe dealing with owies and injuries and stuff like this and something i discovered at night um so with just a couple drops and this is also something i did and it's nothing i was told to do i just did it for me and i felt it better and faster i'll take a couple drops and put it under my tongue and just leave it there for 20 seconds and then swallow it um and last couple nights doing it that way i felt a little bit quicker and it calms me from i don't know if you guys do this but you're always thinking about business business business business and stuff and you can't settle and it made me settle and focus uh on just relaxing so that was that for that uh the gummies the soft gels both do the same thing the cream though i know for you guys um i like putting something on for me i just like doing that uh i like to have the cream in those spots and so i'll put it on the shoulders elbows knees lower back um after the workout and uh we're also pulling in the the what would you call it not a stem machine you would call it a [Music] neural like a neuromuscular device a neuromuscular device which is going to give blood flow yeah so it's a combination um but just this alone was such a nice added touch and so going back to the beginning where i said everything happens for a reason everything came about at the right time and it and i got to try this in a stage where i was at my lowest so imagine if you're doing pretty good how much better you'll feel if it could pull me out of all that trauma i was putting my body through so that's that's kind of why jeffrey's like all right done stop we're gonna talk about this we're gonna tell the people what we're where they're doing and like i said before i talk to the owner and i said can you get my boys and my women warriors around the world a discount jeffrey titan 20 30 20 20 discount code titan click that link in the bio click that link in the comments pin to the top so look for it comments like jeffrey said uh we're gonna put the link and everything down below click on that bad boy um here's the one thing that we talked about the other day is that one percent it was funny because i put up about lotion lotion's good for your body right and you got so many people that were saying um well no no that's a that's a scam okay go do your thing i am the one percent guy if something will help me one percent that's the most minimal amount of help you can get i will do it because my ultimate goal here my ultimate goal here is to have longevity and i need to train well but i need to keep the mind strong and so when i was that beat down if this helped me it's gonna help you there's nothing else i need to say it is your move make it click the link", "LT3VO2UyKMc": "Joe here with the CRM and I'm in New Orleans for how candy planning every day in summer seasonal session and I'm with Jonathan Kaye from tattooed chocolate so the reason why I wanted to bring Jonathan on is because he's gonna be attending he's here now for our session but he's also gonna be attending how food and beverage Zebedee's session in November so thank you for joining us great to be here in Africa I was at your original so much has happened in the year well what's interesting and it will go to jump into your products in a second but what's interesting is I think now we are in a spot where the HBC CBD products were last year right before the farm bill passed so now those are you know getting onto the shelves but people there well we're right at that stage where they're looking for products but they can't put them on ourselves yet so let's sort off tell us about the attention chocolates are tattoo chocolates will be a little edgier kind of a chocolate we are also associated with the hemp love people and so this will be our little edgier maybe a little bit more male manly chocolate and there'll be CBDs different doses we're looking at launching with a 100 gram bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD and that'll be full spectrum as well as we'll have a an isolate bar that so there'll be no THC is zero on that the the the full spectrum has that less than point zero but it does have a trace and that gives you the entourage effect where you get all the terpenes and all the all the flavor oils and things that come with this so let's have a point oh three percent only three bits it's negative it's minus point zero three Oh God exactly THC it's such a trace and especially when you put it in a chocolate bar it's even less because it's you know it's just dispersed over the chocolate bar gotcha but if you like you said you need a little bit in there just a little bit it helps activate exactly all the other chemicals cool gray so so now when so food and beverage seaweedy so it's a little a little different because right now we're they're kind of exploring it but they're not gonna put it on the shelf yet until the FDA gives an opinion but they want to meet with suppliers like exactly there are some states that are allowing the edibles to be on the on the shelves but they're not FDA approved across the country so some retailers are a little hesitant and I don't blame them they you know it's it's you know it's an image issue and we don't want to get pushed things too quickly but as we go through the regulations and working with the MDA and we're giving input to them this will all get approved and they'll being strict regulations and and things that you'll have to do to prove that where your source is and how pure it is and and to give the best medicine to the to the consumer and and chocolate will be our our delivery system for those ten milligrams of medicine great so it's important for our retailers that are considering getting into the food and beverage CBD game to start looking now stop music applause now as early as possible so that when because everybody's kind of the general opinion is that it's going to be a favorable opinion from the yes so this way they let it do your due diligence and make sure that you have all the the CD the codes and then the inspections and and everything is legally tight great so keep an eye out for November so the November hooter beverage seaweedy he's gonna be there with tattoos shortly and I look forward to seeing you again and good luck with the new venture thank you", "QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and thanks very much well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from GMA every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA", "YcGeegDl5lQ": "UNDER UNDER INVESTIGATION.

morning hi welcome to and anything show and today I'm going to show you how to make homemade wheat chocolates that's right folks it's time that we bring leads to the forefront people I mean it's legal basically everywhere except for I love and I recently came into possession of a large quantity of marijuana so when that happens my favorite thing to do is make cannabutter 500 milligrams of THC right here folks making chocolate at home doesn't appear to be that difficult it's basically just a cacao or cocoa powder a sweetener butter and whatever else you feel like adding in this case we're gonna use some hemp arts you can make it in between like plastic bags so that's like a bark or even better you have ice cube trays or like these silicone molds silicone molds that was weird so I'm gonna put some in here and then I also have these awesome weed ice cube tray molds my boyfriend actually got them from his office as a Christmas party because they all think that he's like this huge pothead meanwhile the kid hardly ever smokes weed he just looks stoned half the time so if any of you are watching this I'm calling you out and you do not smoke pot you are not some pothead that everyone thinks you are and the only person that is using these is me I'm concerned slightly that they're brave when they pop out so we'll see what happens I'm gonna do a few in here and a few in here I'm also going to use this maple syrup which is from New Hampshire keeping it local I'm gonna use some vanilla extract with Jam and I just got a Mexico if you haven't seen those vlogs to check them out so this is local to Mexico and I'm gonna use this wheat butter that I made and the weed my frame grew and its local to Western man so sourcing maybe we are sourcing local we're sourcing regional or keeping them heavy in this kitchen the first thing we're gonna do 1/2 cup of coconut oil which is okay and next we're gonna add in 1/2 cup of cacao now with this recipe I'm gonna try to make 10 chocolates with it so I did have to do a bit of crazy calculations but each serving is gonna be about 50 milligrams of THC so this is not for beginners of edibles but I'm no beginner you know the reason I'm mixing everything in this mason jar making a [ __ ] mess already it's because I'm gonna use this immersion blender so we don't have lumps I thought mason jar be the easiest way of course they always thank you underestimated what a slob I am and now I'm annoyed [ __ ] [ __ ] my hair now [ __ ] is this how do people make like measuring stuff looks so easy I always make a mess they just pour out the powder into the half cup and just [ __ ] pours right now but when I do it the whole house needs to be cleaned we are coconut labor cacao now we need our half teaspoon of vanilla I'm really excited to use this stuff it's supposed to be very high quality I had to check my bag to bring him home and everything smells mmm smells like sunblock and vacation 1/2 teaspoon oh we're gonna need three tablespoons of maple syrup it's so good I guess that's it so now we blend much easier than whisking that's for damn sure they're never gonna get all this [ __ ] off the sides because I'm on every last drop hmm how I shouldn't be doing this probably gonna get pretty high by the way I cancelled my dentist appointment this morning I'm not like a counselor of things but we got snow last night it was for two fillings but like they're very small cavities and that's totally not an emergency and I really didn't like spending $200 so you know what I cancelled I felt guilty about it but then as soon as I did it I was like that was the best decision I made hopefully don't charge me okay so now comes the interesting part we want to weigh these out evilly because I want each chocolate to be the same amount of THC so I'm gonna use this 1/2 tablespoon and I'm gonna try to make 10 of these okay we're gonna do a few in the weed chocolate mole because I just think that will look really cool but it might prove to be too difficult and you might have to give it up let's see how it goes in here oh yeah much better - you're gonna add a little bit to each once they're all the same size so now I just want to get you know my place this is gonna be to hide right here well use my hands like I'm getting aggressive right now I'm definitely going after this one mmm just gotta get in there verified me I'm gonna get stoned first thing morning so I also have these hemp parts which you know hemp is also derived from the cannabis plant how'd you get these from Canada because as you know it's still illegal here no plant that like basically does everything let's make it illegal so I'm gonna sprinkle some of these into some of my chocolate just to add like a fun crunch a little bit not every single one but and it just uses chopstick to cut us the world I have into the chocolate a little bit yeah if these come out well the next ones I make I'll probably add like walnuts or something all right so all that's left is putting these in the fridge or the freezer and they're supposed to harden within an hour the next time you see them though it'll be like when I'm going to eat them for the night so I'm gonna keep them in there all during the day I have to do work now let's start my day so we'll see you guys later when it's time to test these bad boys out okay guys it is hours later the day has passed I have popped the chocolates out of the molds as predicted Lee we the mold it was mostly for aesthetic purposes because it really didn't pop out that well my definitely won't do it like that again but it froze them and this is what this one looks like it's very cute you know this is like very gimmicky but in reality in terms of like consistency and uniformity the silicone circular molds were the move anyway I just ate one of these scouts honor scared what is this scout the scouts honor I just ate one of these it's the Shocker oh I just any one of these Dan can attest to it I'm not gonna eat another one because that will be a hundred milligrams of THC and that's something that we're gonna save for another day by another day I mean tomorrow I'm gonna store these in the freezer I think they'll heat for like at least a month they won't be around that long but I love it I'm so proud of myself what an easy way to make weed chocolates at home and a lot more affordable than buying them at the stores now you can buy them in the stores here anyway you have to be on your deathbed one of these days anyway thank you for watching this episode of add anything show and I will see you next time goodbye Nana you don't want these okay if you had like pointing up but I can't see anything [ __ ] meatball go [ __ ] yourself okay guys", "4x58Xq2OpuE": "[Music] hey everybody my name is Katerina and I'm the chief dessert designer and founder of dolled up desserts and today I'm gonna walk you through a super simple but super delicious baked good recipe but this isn't any ordinary baked good today I'm really excited to show you my version of a completely vegan green magic pie but what makes these green magic buyers is a special ingredient called cannabis the good thing about this recipe is that if you don't want to infuse you don't have to totally your choice we're leaving that option up to you but you can still make this recipe and start to finish without infusing your treat I'll make sure I specifically show you how to infuse and then if you choose not to no worries they're your treats after all anyways without further ado let's get baking those green magic bars so the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna take our Oreo we're going to open it right up and we're going to take out the inside now you're gonna take your Oreos you stick them in your blender magic bullet whatever you have it's really anything that blade will work and we're gonna repeat this until your magic bullet is kind of about a quarter of the way through we're gonna be making about a cup and a half of ground Oreo crumbs and you're gonna put your Oreo filling to the side once you've got enough Oreos in here you're gonna crush them up using a magic bullet or whatever blender you have just until they are a very very fine crumb [Music] you're in separate Royals grind them up until you end up with about cup and a half to two cups of Oreos next thing you gonna do is you're gonna take your coconut oil and you're gonna add it into the crumbs of the Oreo we have about half a cup of coconut oil here and we're gonna add in also a little bit of brown sugar mix it all together essentially just gonna mix it until it becomes sticky where I get my hands dirty you'll know it's good once it kind of comes together clumps together like this once you've got your Oreo crust into a sticky ball like sort of texture you're going to grab a 9 by 9 inch pan lined with parchment paper and you're gonna take all of your Oreo from and you're gonna put it right in and I'm gonna use my spatula and I'm gonna press it down so now's the point where we would infuse the treats I'm going to infuse the crust now normally when you're baking with an infused cannabis butter or oil you would put it in with a baked good mix it up really well add some soy lecithin in this case because the oil might not necessarily be a hundred percent properly dispersed in a crust we're actually going to use an eyedropper and we're going to dose it based on the number of squares that we're going to cut out of this bar so the oil that I'm using today I infused to be ten milligrams of THC to four grams of coconut oil an important number and that calculation you need to have because now I know that I have to put four grams of coconut oil per square that I'm making to show that I'm going to actually divide this into nine bars right now I'm going to then take my melted coconut Kanna butter and I'm going to drop four grams into each I know that four grams of this oil is ten droppers full of his-- so I'm gonna drop it in now that our bars have been infused they ready to go let's finish this off we're going to dump a full bag of desiccated unsweetened coconut right on top read it right out to the corners then we're gonna top it off with some vegan Belgian dark chocolate and for people like me who like nuts we're gonna top it off with some walnuts you can omit this you can also add whatever else you want in this place use pecans you can use pretzels you can use really anything that's crunchy you can use nothing at all totally your choice and for the final piece the piece that sticks it all together we're gonna throw in some coconut condensed milk don't worry about it being loopy or kind of sticky on the top it will sink in it will bake in and once it's been spread out it's time to put this bad boy into the oven you're gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes you'll know it's done when the top is golden brown looks a little crispy and everything looks dark but not on the verge of burn all right so our wonderful green dream magic bars have come out of the oven here absolutely gorgeous super caramelized you can notice around the edges they're kind of on the brown side borderline holes for it without the perfect amount of caramelization especially for the middle to make sure it's fully cooked all the way through the last bit to add a little bit of pizzazz is we're gonna take all those Oreo middles that we saved add a little bit of water to it you can also add a non-dairy milk your choice I'm gonna whisk it up and then we're gonna throw it in this piping bag and drizzle it right on the top it's gonna be amazing we're gonna now cut these bars to get them out of the pan if you want to take the whole thing out of the pan I highly suggest you freeze it before we try taking it out cuz it'll be very tricky to get out but it is easier if you just cut them into bars before you go remember when you're cutting your bars to cut them based off of the doses you needed before so we said nine squares so we're gonna cut about where's and that's it ladies and gents this is how easy it is to make a delicious dream bar which can also be a in green bar totally

and jagged edges none of that this is a professional really professional product so let's crack it open and see what they taste like right so really chocolatey smell really the the cocoa is really really really strong okay so let's give it a try so as you can see solid round chocolate i'll split that open for you and if you see that clearer but it's a full solid ball of chocolate so it's melting really nice in the mouth it's smooth it's bitter but in a good way like dark chocolate is it is really smooth it's it's like galaxy the way it melts yeah brilliant so you could eat these all

into your moles you can add some nuts to it we're gonna add some pecans pecans alright so let's get going okay here in the kitchen I'm gonna use a large pot boil water and I'm gonna use this bowl as a double boiler okay now I use the bittersweet chocolate I use the whole cup and I used a half a cup of the milk chocolate so that I have a cup and a half of chocolate all right right into my bowl alright and then these are the moles that we're gonna fill and I'm gonna add some cons to the bottoms of that as we go and then I also have to add the quarter cup of oil coconut oil and I'll do that right now we're gonna melt that chocolate down I'm gonna chop some nuts get the nuts in there we'll be right back all right we're back had a little technical difficulties pouring the chocolate into the molds that all went smoothly but rule number one is don't lick the bowl while you while you're infusing chocolate I ended up believing the video running in it it blew up my videos so I had to delete that segment so we missed that one but this is the finished product I've got some pot leaf molds I've got some gummy bear molds I've got some candy that look like Christmas and some candy canes all in chocolate infused but that's our that's our finished product real easy recipe only a quarter cup of your infused coconut oil a cup and a half of any chocolate that you'd like melt it together

do the trick you make double dose chocolate marijuana brownies and hop up the THC with two layers of cannabis infused chocolate heaven the main brownie is loaded with cannabutter and the icing is also infused with cannabis coconut oil but you could also use butter in that layer too either way these double dose brownies are guaranteed to be a kick in the pants this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling vaporizers wax pans rolling papers and accessories from raw and much more at great prices save 10% on everything all the time with the code canna basics and roughhouse studios.com now here's what you need to make the brownies but be sure to note that the icing ingredients are towards the end of the video you need 1/2 a cup of cannabutter a cup of white sugar 2 eggs a teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder now unless you already have some kind of either made the first step is going to be to make your cannabutter you can definitely use pre bought or store-bought cannabutter for this but we're gonna make our own there'll also be a link in the description and at the end of the video to see how we made this water method of making cannabutter but the first step is going to be to manicure your cannabis make sure that you break it up take out any stems and seeds and then decarboxylate activate it an oven 350 degrees for 30 minutes while that's baking you want to also clarify your butter clarifying your butter it means that you're removing all of the milk solids so that you have a nice yellow pure clear butter oil this will make it more bioavailable it'll also help make the infusion more strong when you infuse the marijuana after your marijuana has decarboxylated it's gonna be lightly toasted brown and we're going to combine that with the butter and then we're also going to combine some water an equal part of butter and water that's one cup of each and then we're also going to add in the cannabis and that's about a 1/2 ounce of of cannabis there and you can definitely vary the amount of cannabis depending on the potency that you want and if you make this amount of cannabis butter you'll have more than enough to do the recipe that we're making today and you'll also have about a quarter cup left over and you can also do like we're doing it combined and you were using part coconut oil and we're also using part of this infused butter but now you got going to strain out your after you've infused for at least two hours over a double boiler you're going to strain out the cannabis and then to separate the water from the butter you could put that in refrigerator for a couple hours and let the water settle to the bottom and then the butter reforms at the top and then you have a nice very good flavored a little bit lighter colored sometimes than other cat about is because you can see the rust colored waters left over there but that's taking away some of the bitter flavor and chlorophyll and impurities away so you have a very clean and a pure butter that's left over its gonna taste delicious and our brownies okay so now we're going to move on to making the brownies [Music] okay we'll begin our brownies by first putting our half a cup of Canada butter over a medium saucepan bringing that up until it's melted and just before it starts to get too hot and start to brown so you want it hot but not not starting to smoke or anything like that so make sure you don't brown the butter and then after it's hot throw it put it in a a dish like a pyrex dish here and then add in your cup of sugar we're good doing this to help melt the sugar and also to cool off the butter so that when we add our egg and next it won't cook our egg so then add in your eggs one at a time and mix those in and then we're also going to add in the vanilla extract it's one teaspoon of vanilla extract again mixing it well and once we have our wet ingredients in there we're gonna now first add in our cocoa and once I add in the cocoa I want to go ahead and mix that in because cocoa can be really messy so I like to go ahead and get the cocoa mixed in before I had in the rest of the dry ingredients so I've got the cocoa mixed and now I'm adding in the flour all-purpose flour one cup I'm adding in a half a cup at a time so it mixed in the first half a cup and now I'm going to add in the second half a cup of flour but then I'm also going to add in the baking powder as well as the salt we're gonna continue mixing that until I have that oh very well incorporated it could take a couple of minutes and what's that well until it's nice and glossy and fully combined now we're going to go ahead and spray and flour my pan I've also lined it in foil that'll just help me pull the brownies out of the hand when I go to cut them but go ahead and oil and flour that generously or they may stick now we're gonna add in the brownie batter you can see the brownie batter is really thick and dark and there's gonna be some really good fudgy brownies so I've got that I'll pour it in the pan I've hit the pan once on the table and let it settle in there and now we're gonna bake the brownies these brownies bake at 325 degrees for 20 minutes you want to sure you keep an eye on those you don't want them to get too Brown but you also want to make sure they get done and you can use a toothpick and stick it in the center if it comes out clean you know they're done [Music] and now while our brownies are cooking we're going ahead and combine all the ingredients for our frosting which is 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder a cup of powdered sugar 3 tablespoons of cannabutter or cannabis infused coconut oil a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of honey we're to combine all of those ingredients into a medium bowl and we'll be combining those all together and in this instance we're using a coconut oil that we already had made that's a really strong coconut oil we want these double those brownies to be really potent so we're using this really extra strong coconut oil but you could also use the same butter that you used in the first half of the recipe you could use that butter or any kind of cannabis infused butter or coconut oil for this part of the recipe and then we've combined all our ingredients here and now we're going to use a spatula or metal spoon and make that combined together into our frosting and ours was really dry so I added in actually some of the butter I ended up adding some of that in as well too to wet it some so that it was the consistency of her frosting it was still a little bit thick but that's ok because we're gonna frost these while the brownies are still hot so we're gonna let the heat of the brownies kind of help melt this fudgy icing it which is more kind of another layer of brownies than it is actually in icing but it just really is delicious and it really adds to the potency especially if you use a really strong oil for this top layer but what you're using is you're letting the heat of the brownies that have come out of the oven they're completely done but they're still warm and we're spreading this fudgy icing over the top of it and we're letting the heat of the brownies kind of melt that icing so that it forms a nice sort of dense layer of fudge on top of these brownies and once that's cooled off you're gonna be able to especially if you use the foil just lift it right up out of the pan and cut these I cut these into 12 sections so that would be at 12 servings but it's up to you to cut them have any slices that you want they're kind of small brownies in this case but these are really rich they're almost almost like a piece of fudge they're very very rich and they're also very strong so the 12 slices was perfect and take a look at those dark and dense and I tell you these are some dank and strong brownies one of these is enough for a serving two of them will really kind of get your mind blown if you use a strong infusion like we did here they're very moist and I used a really high-quality cocoa so they have a real rich dark chocolaty flavor this episode of Canada basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories vaporizers are much more in great prices

Joe Namath I'm a periodontist in Southfield Michigan and I want to talk a little bit today about CBD or CBD oil cannabidiol CBD CBD oil can be derived from the marijuana plant or it can be derived from the hemp plant it does not have THC in it THC is the ingredient that causes one to get high so this does not have that in it so it doesn't cause you to get high but it is used for pain control and many people it can be used as a as a rub to help control pain in children it may help control seizures it may help reduce anxiety but today I want to talk about the possible role of CBD in the mouth in oral health and specifically on your gum tissue so there was a study using rats what they did was they induce gum disease or periodontal disease in these rats by using certain kinds of wires that irritate the gum tissue and these rats were given CBD actually there were two groups of rats a control group that did not receive the CBD and the experimental group that did receive the CBD now the CBD was given in the form of injection and of course when you brush your teeth you're not going to be injecting CBD they found that at the end of the trial period the rats that had been given the CBD had much less bone destruction they healed much faster and their gums were much healthier relative to the rats in the control group that did not receive the CBD so CBD by the way CBD is now a buzzword you could hear it everywhere and you're gonna hear even more about it because a lot of people think it's the holy grail well it's not the Holy Grail but it may be helpful in certain situations and maybe it's even helpful in the mouth it does tend to reduce inflammation it doesn't kill bacteria so there are some toothpaste some very strong toothpastes that have ant bacterial agents in them and those antibacterial agents kill most or all of the bacteria in the mouth even the good ones on the other hand there are now toothpastes that have CBD incorporated in the toothpaste and these do not destroy the good bacteria but they enable the good bacteria to to proliferate and continue to grow and minimize the harm of the bad bacteria also a great role for CBD is it does reduce anxiety and so it might be very helpful for patients to take some CBD CBD oil something with CBD before a dental appointment to reduce their anxiety of course in our dental office there's no anxiety because we never cause any patients any pain but basically if one has anxiety it does tend to help reduce anxiety and it's very effective for that in a future video I want to talk more about CBD and specifically I want to talk about marijuana and actually smoking marijuana because as opposed to CBD or CBD oil which could have a therapeutic role I think the jury is still out a bit on it marijuana and the smoke actually is probably and is harmful to the gum tissue because the smoke tends to dry out the gum tissue and may reduce the blood supply to the gum tissue so there's a big difference between smoking marijuana which has THC typically and CBD which doesn't so I'm going to talk more about these subjects marijuana CBD in the future but I just wanted to give you a glimpse of potentially what may be going on now and I want to remind you to keep your mouth healthy because if your mouth is healthy I guarantee your body will be healthier subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd love to hear from you and have a great day restore your smile and your health visit dr. Nemeth calm to schedule your appointment today", "wKefGrIaUhQ": "you know here at truebloods TV we love the edibles so today we are making our own cannabis infused chocolate bars using some semi-sweet chocolate and some cannabis infuse coconut oil to see exactly how I made this check out one of my recent videos I'll post a link in the description but the cool part about today is Russell at cannabis candy molds shoutout him sent me these chocolate bars along with my favorite part these cool ass molds and look professional they look like molds or chocolates you would get at a dispensary also came with some foils some bags to wrap them up in who wouldn't love that as a present and a cool stamp so you could put that on anything to keep it out of reach and keep things safe what you need here is a double boiler or you can do what I'm doing iced have a pot here I'm gonna use a pyrex dish I was gonna buy a Dutch oven but I'm like I don't have one so I want to show you you can make it work with what you got I'm going to turn this on to a low medium low heat set that baby in there and let's start out with the semi-sweet chocolate I'll pop the camera in so you can see a little better you don't want it too hot you want to make sure you do this at a slow low temp as you can see it's starting to melt it's probably about two tablespoons there that's a lot that's probably over a half cup that supplies half cup three quarters so I just added half of the other chocolate bar to give it a little more texture because it's looking a little liquidy give it a little stir now we're gonna go ahead and just dump it in the mold so there we have it we have the foam molds about 1/2 cup of the coconut oil with a bar and a half of the chocolate we're gonna let it set in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour all right so it's about an hour later and they are hardened let's go ahead a little put beautiful beautiful might have been able to wait an extra few minutes but hey I wanted to try one no let's try one tastes good nice coconut oil flavor chocolate animus taste isn't overwhelming thank you again Russell at cannabis candy molds for the amazing molds chocolate the goody bags foil and the molds worked perfectly [Music]", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "ZRWY3kxn2RI": "hey guys happy tuesday so today i'm going to review blush wellness's entire line or most of their line of cbd products so the the thing about these is they're supposed to be for anti-anxiety i have anxiety i have something called generalized anxiety disorder which means that a lot of things stress me out and um cbd is supposed to be this natural thing that relaxes you now question does cbd get you high answer it does not it it does not even though it's like a derivative of marijuana or whatever it's not something that gets you high so i hope that i answered that question for you i'm going to let you know what i actually think of them as far as busting anxiety for a person that is clinically anxious so should be an interesting video a little different than usual let's get into it in this video we're going to take a look at five different products the roll-ons the bath bomb the cbd chocolate bites the balance gummies and the tincture so what we're going to begin with is that tincture which i think is one of the most well-known products out in the cbd world so right now we're looking at the premium cbd tincture it comes in either lemon ginger which i have here or orange creamsicle i actually really enjoyed first of all the way that this tastes i've had other tinctures before and they've not been the best tasting this was good so the cool thing about the tincture is it's very similar to take um as like a suboxone it's sublingual so you put the eyedropper under your tongue and it gets into your bloodstream rather quickly as a result next up let's try the roll-ons so first of all we have awaken with 250 milligrams of cbd and serenity with 500 milligrams of cbd so these roll-ons are my favorite in in the blush product line and that's because i really love aromatherapy when i was a kid and i used to miss my mom i used to take her perfume and just spray it and i would stop missing her because like the smell of her would be around so that's how much like aromatherapy and smelling things like has always been to help me calm my anxiety and um finding a good product that you know smells good and calms me down and i can put on my pulse points i'm i'm really happy that i found this so the serenity the blue one actually contains a little bit more cbd than the other one but i consider the yellow one to be just a little bit more calming than the other although they both have great qualities to them i think that it's the chamomile in the yellow one that really just relaxes me and [Applause] i put the roll-ons on my pulse points so i did it on my temples just below my ear and on my wrists now let's take a look at the balance of gummies [Music] i gotta admit these gummies did not help me at all they kind of remind me of gumdrops i think they were going for like a vitamin thing but it just did not work with me [Music] so according to the back of the bag these guns contain 25 milligrams of broad spectrum cbd 14 calories zero grams of fat and two sugars which i wasn't that happy about and three carbs of all the product so of all the products by blush wellness this is the one that i'm least happy with so raise your hand if you like bath bombs i love bath bombs and i used to buy them all the time from this store in the mall called lush and i i've never had a bath i never actually have had like an actual bath in my home or my apartments like i've always had really small creepy little showers but we have our own house now and i actually have a bath for the first time ever so i've been using all of the bath bombs that i had purchased before so i will eventually use this and i will let you know how it was but it smells so good so it's got 100 milligrams of cbd in it and it smells amazing i remember when i first got the package or like i brought it into my house and it smelled like this and it's just really lemony and awakening and all of that good stuff i really like it and i have another product in the awaken line and that's the chocolate now this came free from my last purchase it was when you spend 40 or more on the products you get the free chocolate so there's only one left should i blame it on my kids or should i admit that i ate them i don't know hahaha so it was me so cue the fat jokes because i know that someone will make one but anyway um i actually really thought that these worked and they calmed my anxiety after eating that's what it looks like when you take a bite you know what it tastes like it tastes like captain crunch um so you just eat like half of it and it's supposed to be able to calm you down [Music] i was just worried about like how they would come in transit but you don't have to worry about anything getting broken or anything like that they're very nicely packaged now as for the price these are really expensive items i purchased them on instagram and i got a really good discount i wound up trying the tincture and the gummies for like twelve dollars or something like that and you can do it too so you can either go onto instagram and go to blush wellness or just type in um sorry or just type in cbd gummy trial or cbd blush wellness trial something along that like that into google i called and asked the company if they would give me like some sort of a code so that i could give it to you guys but they just they just started out they're like brand new and they're kind of going crazy right now now that brings us to so they did not give us a code now that brings us to the controversy there is a bit of a controversy to the company if you go onto their instagram page you'll see all of these comments about how it's a fake company not to buy from them don't trust them that they cancelled their order and all of a sudden they just kept on charging them and kept on taking money out of their bank account and these are real things that people have said about the company now i obviously i have to mention it because it is the truth it is something that you know people have voiced concerns about this but what i tend to think is going on is i think that this is a brand new company they're very new they don't really know what they're doing and um there's a learning curve to it and they're a startup okay so startups like there's often like this craziness that goes on before they figure out how to really get stuff done and i think that that's what they're going through right now and while i would absolutely suggest for you to get your trial your trial for 15 bucks to try the tincture and the gummies i would say to wait on another order and that is because my order of the bath bomb the chocolates and the roll-on took me seven weeks maybe two months to get and yeah it was frustrating and it was annoying and you know i'm looking on their instagram and i'm seeing all of these messages from people like that it's a fake company and i started to get disheartened because i'm like i don't believe that it's a fake company but everyone else thinks that they're fake and that that you know so there was a bit of that going on but they're not a fake company they're not a fake company they're just new they're just getting used to what they're doing and i think that if you're exploring the use of cbd for your anxiety this is a great company to start out with to see if it's something that actually works for you yeah i was really bummed when i kept on checking the website every day and there was nothing new no new news about my package and other people were doing that as well but i happened to watch shark tank and that's how i knew i'm like there's there a newbie company a startup or whatever and i worked for a startup too and i literally only worked for them for five weeks because it is that difficult to work for a startup but you know like i said i think they're good i just think that it's gonna require like a little bit of time for them to catch up and everything so i hope that you enjoyed this video that is everything that i have for you about cbd", "fDmwnY2HsyI": "hey guys it's Brad from Hema DS WWF Brenda's calm I am the owner of Hema DS which is the one of the first and one of the largest legal CBD product retailers and wholesalers I'm also the global sales manager for one of the first and few legal CBD oil product manufacturers I also on plan of renown which is which is one of the

many of the major manufacturers I should say so yeah you can put your contact information in the work with us section of my website I will get back in touch with you or maybe if you are a consumer and you would like to see our products at your local leap store or health store have the owners give me a call I definitely will contact them and get our products in there for you fast with that being said today's video is on a company I absolutely love this is casa luna chocolates wanted to say hi to my friend vaughn out there for helping me out getting his products stocked up on like on my website this company is amazing two things i love about it number one the quality of these chocolates is unbelievable they have vegan choc they have the vegan treats no preservatives no additives no artificial colors a few of them are certified non-gmo and certified vegan the second thing that I love about these is the CVD amounts the you know I said in all of my videos my main goal is to bring people the highest quality and highest concentrated CVD products there is for their money and this is definitely one of those products so this is legal this is made with industrial hemp oil that's naturally high in CBD you get a whopping 60 milligrams of CBD in one bar so it's preparation to be broken up six ways guys so you've got six 10 milligram servings or 60 milligrams if you eat the whole bar you know if you're a fat kid like May and likes a snack on chocolates in the middle of night I not get one of these back in one shot because they're just that good and at the price of $16 a for 60 milligrams of CBD you just can't beat if these are excellent for people that want to eat their meds obviously when you take CBD orally it's going to go through your digestive tract and hit your cb2 receptors your cb2 receptors work on your immune system so eating a CBD is always good obviously when you vaporize let's go to your cb1 receptor in your brain being distributed through all of your cb1 receptors and your body that's gonna work on your central nervous system so yeah with that being said check these out these are under the CBD edibles tablet my website to find that you go to heaven

these scissors and I've got scissors in my hand not because I'm reviewing scissors I'm sure that there probably is a market out there for somebody who wants to review scissors no I've got scissors because I'm here to open a tough package one that I knew I'm gonna have trouble with but one that I am excited for because it is my one of my favorite kinds of edibles and that is the chocolate bar ooh the Sun is making that very difficult to see bad son bad bad son la familia it's the product of Los Angeles the mint flavor I read all the Spanish in English oh it looks like there's like four years of Spanish paid off so this is the la familia de la I almost said that terribly mint to flavor 200 milligrams of THC really that is quite obnoxious how that shows up they're very thin curtains I have um very simple packaging on this it's just like a little aluminum wrapper on this green kind of iridescent packaging you can feel not much to it again just like a sticker on an aluminum packaging it does have nutrition facts and ingredients on the back which is great but no lab test results so this is came from a black market or gray market dispensary in California because we all we all know all legal edibles are now 100 milligram edibles topped and they have to be ten servings or more this is an old-school 200 don't give a [ __ ] how many servings so let's go ahead and cut open the top here take a look at this chocolate bar give it a taste and if you've never tuned in before and if you have tuna before you must really [ __ ] hate here this by now but if you haven't the way of the reviews work here on weeds is I'm gonna eat a little bit of this here in front of you not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll eat this whole thing and then after I finish it I will come back to you guys in another two hours write us about when you'd be peaking to let you know how the product is actually hitting because that's what you're really in it for that's what you really care about is you know is it really gonna make you is it really gonna work not so much how it tastes okay Wow a very basic looking chocolate bar here totally basic it doesn't even have like an imprint with their logo on it or anything it is just what 12 squares of or twelve rectangles of chocolate I'm not gonna break it off into single rectangles let's just give it bite on three it smells like no I don't really detect a cannabis odor to it definitely a mint odor I'm a fan of mint chocolate I know there are a lot of mint chocolate haters out there I don't understand that but teach their own okay that's pretty good chocolate I'm decent quality chocolate for sure the mint flavor is not overwhelming I've definitely had some mint chocolates that are way more minty flavor more of a hint of mint here which is nice really no cannabis tasting I can't really detect much of any no hmm well what I hope that means is the chocolate is excessively masking the flavor of the cannabis and not that there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there mmm I never got to mention I picked this up on at the dispensary that I mentioned for $17 I believe which is two dollars more than they charge for a two hundred and thirty sixty milligram delta-9 which are excellent so high expectations for the la familia mint 200 milligrams here well guys I'm gonna eat another nine squares of this and then I will be back to you as I said in two hours let you know how it's hitting thanks for watching weights guys see in just a bit peace [Music] it's two hours later hi guys welcome back uh it has been 2 hours since I had the la familia and that still does not show up very well on this camera and I apologize for that there's a little bit of a better angle and the familiar the family that la familia is together families together is my review the end no my more elaborate view is it's pretty good it's not the most potent chocolate bar I've ever had chocolate bars are usually I believe the strongest and best vector for THC this one doesn't feel like a - like a kiva equivalent to me certainly not not even close really but it's still pretty good I'm at about a 6 right now some somewhere in that range so it's not you know terrible I've had 200 milligram edibles that are way worse and it didn't it tasted pretty good there's really no cannabis taste so you know on the whole I it's not the best you know there are certainly better chocolate bars out there I still would even probably recommend one of the new Kiva 100 milligrams over this la familia 200 milligram but if it's although your dispensary has and you like the chocolate bars this one's got a good taste it'll still do the job it's just probably not honest about that 200 milligrams would be my guess so if you have no other options and you like chocolate grab it otherwise go with one of the better brands pick up a kiva pick up a default say even probably a chill that one doesn't taste as good but I think it's more potent so stick with the bit the bit better brands if you can otherwise la familia is not a bad alternative and that is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm gonna give you a very quick cherry on top guys just a soup quick little cherry on top something just so delightful and hairy I'll get you out of here real quick and that is cursing swearing profanity I mean I've been profanity since before my teenage years [ __ ] I [ __ ] love cursing it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] damn [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's great um if you if you don't curse a lot you should curse more if you don't curse at all what the [ __ ] is wrong with you cursing is the best the science is on my side you know they say that people who curse are more intelligent they're more honest they're more empathetic I've read that they actually have bigger dongs and that they're also better lovers to that I most of those are things that I've read so uh curse say [ __ ] a lot you'll like it la familia it's not that shitty thank you for sticking around to the end of this cherry on top thank you for sticking tuned to the end of this review appreciated Alice always guys it's been a [ __ ] blast see on the next week's peace", "LZLYzaIJs-I": "hi there welcome to another one of my videos thank you for taking your time and watching them i also want to welcome all the new youtube subscribers twitter followers and instagram followers to the family remember to click the subscribe button below that way you can join the fam that way you don't miss out on any new episodes new giveaways and more let's get right to it on this video i'm going to tell you about the true chocolate bar that i picked up from true leave in tallahassee i paid 20 for this bar and it came in at 100 milligrams total divided into 10 squares of 10 milligrams each looks like a standard chocolate bar the ten squares are clearly marked and easy to split apart and a square does have a thc warning icon so you can easily tell its medicine the smell is that of delicious milk chocolate the flavor is only of milk chocolate there was no oil or wheat taste none of that i ended up eating the two pieces shown here to test the effects i did this since i eat edibles for my back pain on a daily basis so my tolerance for them is high for people new to edibles i recommend trying half of one piece waiting an hour and going from there on to the effects the first effect that failed was the stress of the two and a half hour commute to tallahassee fade away this left me completely relaxed and my head feels a little bit lighter than normal and it also feels like my eyesight takes a little bit longer to catch up to the movement of my head later on a gigantic smile came over me and i know it was a chocolate since i was dealing with a work issue at the time my chronic back pain is gone and it stayed gone through the effects there were also tingly shields every now and then when my skin was touched her air went on my skin this bar gives me high hopes for when they start doing strange specific edibles in the future the best part is that true leave has shown time after time that they're able to grow at an absurd rate so i bet the strength specific edibles won't be too far away plus my opinion that edibles is going to be tarnished by the fact that i eat edibles on a daily basis making my tolerance for them higher than normal so in my humble opinion these will work best for people who are not daily edible users can i work on the strain for sure the effects of this bar were strong enough to keep my mood balanced my back pain gone and kept me stressed and anxiety free this helped my work very big time i use this edible any time day or night i hope this helps you meditate right have a great day", "AIhELWPJcO8": "[Music] Aya's Madden roughhouse Studios and welcome to cannabase --ax today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused cocoa butter [Music] cocoa butter is a pale yellow edible vegetable fat it's extracted from the cocoa bean and is used to make chocolate as well as many ointments toiletries and pharmaceuticals cocoa butter has a natural chocolatey flavor and aroma and also has a high saturated fat content making it a good vehicle for infusing cannabis in order to do this we're going to need about a 1/2 ounce of dried cannabis - a 1 pound or 16 ounces of food grade cocoa butter and optionally you need 1 teaspoon of soy lecithin powder and to do this year we're going to be using an oven - decarboxylate err cannabis and a double boiler setup to do the infusion you could also use an infusion machine like the mighty fast herbal and fuser and you can save $30 on the mighty fast herbal infuser with a co roughhouse at the herbal infuser calm but to thank them for sponsoring this episode the first step is going to be to grind and decarboxylate our cannabis so what I'm doing now is I've weighed out 1/2 pounds of cannabis and I'm grinding it go make sure I pull out any big stems and any seeds that I may have once I have it all ground up I also want to put this into a dish where I can spread it out evenly so I'm using this large glass there's just so we can see it in the video but whatever big dish you have you can spread it out nice and even so it'll cook even we're gonna put that in the oven preheated at 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna let that D card for 25 minutes [Music] now when you're making cannabis infused cocoa butter you want to make sure that you're using food grade cocoa butter there's other cocoa butters that you could get that aren't necessarily designed for you to eat it might be used to make our hair products or something like that or candles so make sure that you're getting food grade and I'll put links to where you can get that on Amazon okay and we're going to be putting our 1 pound of cocoa butter into a double boiler that's got boiling water underneath it and we're gonna let that melt let's go take a few minutes to melt but I should take about the same amount of time as it took to decarboxylate our cannabis so by the time that 25 minutes is gone by you're also going to have your cocoa butter nice and melted nice and hot so it's that point cannabis is out and we're going to be able to add that into our cocoa butter and this is much like infusing butter or infusing any other kind of oil such as olive oil or coconut oil which we've done before and so it's going to be a very similar process we're going to be letting this infuse for one to two hours [Music] notice I'm letting that infuse without a lid on it and I'm doing that because I don't want the condensation to build up and let any water drip through so you want to avoid letting any water comment on contact with this especially if you're making chocolate but once we have our infusion down we're going to filter that out now filter the plant material out and you can do that with cheesecloth or a cotton muslin bag or a filtration bag if you're using the mighty fast turbulent fuser you'll have that HEPA filtration bag that's included with that we're using a fine mesh filter which works perfect you see we were done there our cocoa butter is now a much darker colored and has been infused with that cannabis has a lot of different flavor now and I've put that in the refrigerator for a little while so it'll harden up and you can see what it looks like but it hardens up very brittle like chocolate it'll have that snap to it and you can use this for a lot of different things you may notice at the bottom it looks like there's a puddle of brown stuff but that's a very very thin just a little color layer there of some very fine sediment that's filtered through and that's nothing to worry about and you could use like a vegetable peeler and just break that off if it bothered you very much but it really just is a very thin layer so I'm just chopping it up now so I could store it and you can store this for as long as you want in the refrigerator you can even freeze it until you're ready to use it and there's several different methods that you can use this for different cooking methods and you can also use

to anyone with a sweet tooth because we're going to be talking about CBD gummies if you're watching this you probably know a thing or two about CBD already maybe you've tried the CBD oil or capsules and you're thinking about branching out to other products well CBD gummies are a great alternative to consume CBD they're sweet they're fun they come in a variety of flavors and they're super convenient and discreet so let me show you a few tested and trusted companies that sell CBD gummies so that you can satisfy your sweet tooth and enjoy those incredible CBD virtues also if you want to buy any CBD products click the link in the video description that's where you'll find the best and latest deals so first on the list we have royal CBD gummies these guys are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD in each gummy they're offered at $79.99 and the pack contains 30 gummies they come in a round shape and they're or they're offered in an assortment of three flavors strawberry grape and orange they use only natural ingredients and they have no animal derivatives which means that there are a hundred percent vegan next on the list is Charlotte's Web gummies these guys provide three areas of focus for their gummies so if you're having trouble sleeping they have gummies specific for that if you want gummies to relax they have the calm focus gummies and then they have the recovery targeted gummies so each pack contains 60 servings with 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy the sleep version is raspberry flavor and it contains melatonin the calm version is lemon-lime flavored and the recovery pack is ginger flavored and contains turmeric and each pack is sold by a Charlotte's Web at $54.99 then there are two CBD effects products that I want to share with you the first one is just the regular gummies these guys are sold for 49.99 and there are 60 gummies per pack but each gummy is only packed with 5 milligrams of CBD that's one of the lower dosage and it's a great option if you're just getting started with CBD these are mixed berry flavored and they're also vegan the other product is the CBDs melatonin gummies for sleep so obviously these should be taken right before you go to bed and these will help you get a good night's rest so same price and same amount of gummy bears per pack except these gummy bears are loaded with 10 milligrams of CBD and 5 milligrams of melatonin the flavor is juicy lemon and of course they are also vegan last but not least the just CBDs gummies now these are for those who are dead serious about CBD gummies this 3,000 milligrams jar contains about 220 gummy bears packed with thirteen point five milligrams of CBD each so if you're taking a few of these daily then this could be a really good option to buy in bulk but you don't have to stick to gummy bears they actually have quite a few different options but they all have different CBD dosage so make sure to check it in the description all right this wraps up this video on CBD gummies I hope you enjoyed it if you're thinking about buying some for yourself or for a friend just make sure to click the link in the video description you'll get the best prices and the latest deals have an amazing day", "ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "_mJYQtsh94Q": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today i'm going to be doing another edible review i will be reviewing the chill chocolates bam now these guys are a traditional white chocolate with oreo i believe oreo cookies on the inside at first to be honest i didn't want to try this nothing about this packaging looks new or inventive or really appetizing the the gloss finish on these boxes is not helping it it looks it looks a bit cheap okay i don't want to be that person cheap edibles can be great sometimes but a lot of them are not so i didn't want to try them purely off just the way they looked and then the fact that they are pretty expensive where i found these these guys are 100 milligrams for 22. but i i tried them i did i said why not you know i need to try another new edible something i haven't seen before and these guys were those let me tell you yes it may not look like much but these edibles are delicious they are absolutely fantastic so they come in this small box in the box you will find this box and this box is actually super cool because this box can be used later like i can hold weed in it and stuff at least that was my original thought to do with this box but sadly i cannot open this box at all i'll try to open it right now and it has like a little thing right here to show you how to do it it should just be a squeeze on both sides here there's a little part where you know you put your fingers on and then you're supposed to lift this at the same time it all should pop off it should pop off easy it's for babies not to be able to get into but i'm guessing a lot of stoners can't get into this at all as well but in that box you will find this bag in this bag you will find your edibles these are the small milk chocolate edibles with cookie crunches inside a lot of the time chocolate edibles i do get a very strong marijuana taste to it these guys i did not at all so kudos to chill you guys made a great tasting chocolate i don't even like white chocolate i'm not someone who goes for white chocolate often it's not something i really enjoy usually it comes off too sweet but these are like fantastic and every one of these small little pieces is 10 milligrams and it comes with 10 of them i took 50 milligrams because i didn't think it would have much of effect to be honest i already was thinking down on this edible i said it doesn't look great it tastes almost a little bit too good i'm gonna eat a little more and 50 milligrams let me tell you this it was bomb if you bump into chilled chocolates buy them because they are bomb i mean usually 50 milligrams i wouldn't be like as blown as i honestly was and it was a good high it was good i wasn't sure what they used for um how to medicate these chocolates but it was very much a body high my body was super relaxed so if you if you suffer from a lot of body aches if you have a lot of back problems like i've been suffering with my back a lot lately these guys are great for that because they're also delicious they're delicious you don't need much of it and they work after my height went away i did get the sleepies though because it is such a heavy body high i do believe once these edibles kind of wear off your body now knows it's time to go to bed and that's what i did i fell asleep super early yesterday so each batch in the back it says is tested three times and let me tell you it is very accurate the milligrams on here was fantastic so if you're looking for something that's easy tasting something good to help you out with some back pains and it's something that's reliable with its strength go to your little dispensary and pick up some chilled chocolates man do it you will not regret it again my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will catch you guys on the flip side you", "81YRgf39vtY": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it Sheboygan and today we're coming in with the shorter story but nevertheless a [ __ ] bang or hope you guys enjoy drop a like if you do also I do want to mention real quick if you guys haven't subscribed to my second channel my smoking slash gaming channel be sure to do that it'll be linked in the top of the description don't forget to drop a like if you enjoy let's dive right into it so either way eating a thousand milligrams of THC now I don't recommend anyone do this you know that's one thing that I wanna I want to make very clear and the reason that I was able to do this and to an extent handle it I mean I passed the [ __ ] out but to an extent handle it is because I smoke and have smoked a lot of marijuana and done a lot of different things with THC in my life and large quantities so you know I I'm kind of I don't know for some reason edibles just never really get me like that you know like I can't just eat a you know bag of edibles and just get high it doesn't work for some reason with me and I I mean it used to but as I you know kind of progressed and started smoking more and more you know and this happened fairly recently and you know as I started smoking more and more and just getting older and becoming more of like a veteran smoker if you if you could say I guess you know edibles just stopped having an effect on me for some reason it was mainly just dabs and bud that would get me I which I'm ok with and you know it still is that way but you know either way I decided you know can I I wanted to test if I could really get higher or not off edibles like truly baked like how I used to get off the edibles you know I was curious because the past couple times before this that I'd eaten edibles I didn't really get very high at all I had to combine it with you know a couple blunts or something to really get where I wanted to be so you know I had a couple bags I had three bags in total of these edibles that were I think they were I know they were medical they were like actually professionally made not like some homemade brownies or anything they were these little uh these gummies and they were called like terrible's I think I think I've made a video about these before but it was a different story but these edibles were the same edibles in that video so you guys remember that shout-out to you that's an old video I think but either way these things have 400 milligrams a bag so I figured you know my original plan was I'm just gonna eat two bags and then I was like well I kind of just want to get to the 1000 because that's a cool number you know and like I'd been sitting on these bags for a little while I was originally planning to sell a couple of them but I figured [ __ ] it I might as well not you know I kind of like these like they not only you know did they have THC in them and quite a lot but they were actually pretty tasty like there were some good edibles and I've had some edibles that did not taste too good but these are pretty flames you can't really tell that there's Whedon them like if I just put these in a bag I don't think you could tell they're edibles by eating them until you get high as [ __ ] but either way you know I decided I'm gonna eat like two and a half bags and go for that 1000 so off I went you know I looked at the back the dosage was like there was like 20 pieces in each bag so I was like alright I got to eat 50 of these [ __ ] so I literally poured out two bags onto a plate and then I like pulled out ten little like gummy things out of the other bag and I was just like alright I'm digging in so yeah I went pretty ham on it you know I I was on an empty stomach I hadn't eaten and you know I found up and probably a solid like fifteen ten minutes even you know I mean I really I went for it man I went for it man I'll tell you right now and you know at first I didn't really know what to expect you know I this was by far the most I'd ever eaten in terms of edibles and I wasn't really sure what to expect because I figured in my head like that can't be that like insane you know like I'm probably gonna be kind of stone but I don't think I'm gonna be super [ __ ] up but edibles are very different than just smoking a ton of weed edibles you know they're there in my eyes a silent killer they sneak up on you and just [ __ ] you they just do your dirt and let me tell you I was sitting on my couch and I was playing some games I had my Nintendo switch hooked up to the TV it was Boston and let me tell you I was playing tomorrow cart and it just happened man you know I was I got done with a couple races and I didn't really like notice when it hit me but it was very quick you know I got up to grab something to drink and I felt like how do I describe it I felt like those like balloon people out front of the car dealerships those like Wiggly like inflatable tube guys with the flailing arms you know the the family guy like skit they did on that I felt like one of those dudes I felt very very noodley I felt very wobbly and I was I was you know I wasn't really a fan of it but either way I made it up the stairs grab something to drink went back downstairs and just slammed into the couch just absolutely collapsed into the couch I was never so happy to sit back down ever in my life and have an ice-cold water it was so happy it was just a truly a cherished moment a moment of pure euphoria if you will but either way you know I sat back down and I was loving this [ __ ] let me tell ya I was just skirting on Mario Kart playing like [ __ ] I don't think I want any races I played like probably five or six races in a row and I think I came in no higher than fifth in any of them but nevertheless I sure as hell was having fun because let me tell you guys if you if you have a switch you know but if you don't have a switch playing online on Mario Kart is scary because the Japanese guys are really good like the [ __ ] Japanese guys are so good like they don't play but either way you know back on topic so I'm just getting smoked by the Japs dude it's like [ __ ] Pearl Harbor all over again it's terrible and you know I'm eventually I tap out you know I go to play some other games I end up playing some Xenoblade gas game super vague I love the switch by the way this is not sponsored but the switch is a great console it's so convenient so convenient but either way you know I'm chilling and you know I I don't really like I'm not doing anything that takes too much thought so I'm not really like realizing how high I am but eventually as playing games maybe like an hour and a half into it and I hop on my computer you know where I always am the bool spot and you know I'm just playing some games on discord with some people and I'm just something very loud just bangs outside of my house am I getting robbed all right well if I get robbed that would be kind of late for the commentary but either way back on topic hopefully not um you know I was on discord with some buddies playing some games and I I realized as I was playing with them that like nothing I was saying was really coherent whatsoever like I was like I mean I was I was able to talk and conversate but like I was just talking like an idiot pretty slowly and everything I said was just dumb you know like I I just I knew inside that I was just being an idiot but I just couldn't control myself if that makes sense you know I was just being a [ __ ] and I couldn't handle it but either way yeah I was like all right you know I have to plan maybe like two or three games to counter-strike I was like all right I'm going to bed [ __ ] this like I got to lay down or something you know I was slumped because as I was progressing through these games you know counter-strike games are long I played like 2 or 3 games and they're probably like 30 minutes a game you know 30 to 40 so long games so you know after like two and a half hours into my high I was slumped you know and it wasn't like this SuperDuper baked like whoa man kind of thing it was just like the entire thing was very very passive it was like I just I was just chilling you know like that's honestly the best way to put it you know it was a really nice body high you know very noodley just [ __ ] didn't feel like I had any bones you know I just kind of felt like a I don't know dude what doesn't have bones do frogs have bones frogs have bones but not very strong one so I'm gonna say I felt like a frog and it was just some wild [ __ ] it was a fun time but either way hope you guys did enjoy this video a little short story today also on the second channel the smoking slash gaming channel the videos on there are more you know I put a lot more effort into the production of them you know it's a lot more editing a lot more work so it's gonna take longer to get uploads on that channel so please do be understanding impatient with that but yeah that's all I got to say either way thanks for watching hope you enjoyed it see you guys next time peace", "K5B31jru74w": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome back to hello hi for another quick and easy cannabis recipe today i have a special treat for everyone that loves strawberries just like me we are making strawberry milk chocolates using infused coconut oil we're also adding freeze-dried strawberries to make the chocolate taste like it really has fresh strawberries added to it so let's get started you'll need white chocolate wafers dark chocolate wafers freeze-dried strawberries can of coconut oil strawberry flavoring cocoa powder and candy molds pour the freeze-dried strawberries into a plastic bag and use your hands or glass to crush the strawberries until you have both fine and small pieces i'll make sure i leave the link below for the strawberries i bought them on amazon but you can get them from your local supermarket make sure you leave some small chunks so each bite tastes like you bit into a fresh strawberry when you're finished put them aside gradually add the white chocolate wafers to a double boiler on low heat and stir every few minutes until the chocolate is melted make sure you stir up chocolate often until it has a smooth creamy texture so it doesn't start to burn once the chocolate is melted add one teaspoon of strawberry flavoring and stir for a couple minutes until combined now you want to make sure you watch this whole video because i'm infusing both the white chocolate and the dark chocolate for this recipe and you don't want to miss a step and if you haven't already give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel and turn on those notifications so you don't miss any of my videos two tablespoons of infused coconut oil to the chocolate and stir until combined then grab those freeze dried strawberries and add them to the chocolate too use a spoon or a piping bag and fill your molds three quarters full make sure you don't fill them to the top because you won't have any room for the milk chocolate you want to fill your molds pretty quickly before the chocolate starts to set and with this recipe i made about 30 chocolates after you fill your molds make sure you shake and tap each one lightly on the counter to make sure they're smooth and evenly set in the molds put the chocolates in the refrigerator for about one hour and let's start infusing the milk chocolate add one cup of dark chocolate wafers to a double boiler on low heat and stir until melted next add one teaspoon of cocoa powder to the dark chocolate this step is optional i like to add cocoa powder because it gives it cuts the bitterness in the dark chocolate and gives it a sweeter taste but make sure you stir the chocolate until the cocoa powder has dissolved now pour in that last tablespoon of coconut oil and stir until it's combined now we're going to grab those molds out of the refrigerator and let's add the chocolate on top pour the chocolate in each mold over the strawberry chocolate but make sure you fill the molds to the top and tap each mold when you finish so the bottom of the chocolates will be smooth put the chocolate in the refrigerator for about an hour after an hour your chocolate should be ready to take out the molds you can get really creative with these molds you can get some that got roses and weed leaves and all different types of stuff but i'll make sure i put the link below for where i got these modes on amazon now each chocolate should pop right out of the molds with ease if you try to pop one out and it's difficult they may not be ready and then just put them back in the refrigerator for about another hour we are finished and thank you for watching this whole video and if you haven't already give this video a thumbs up and subscribe below but before we end this video oh my god these chocolates i'm gonna have to pan this camera down so you can see these chocolates because they are amazing now you know i had to put the leaf in there too but do you see these chocolates look how you can almost see the strawberries in the chocolate and when you bite on into that it's going to taste like strawberries and then we got the chocolate on the other side these came out great and thank you guys for watching this video and i'll make sure i leave all the links below for the flip the flavoring and the freeze-dried strawberries um and for the chocolate and the molds everything will be down low and i'll see you on the next video", "38h5vfEs3Wk": "here's the problem with edibles they provide a notoriously unpredictable user experience you ask 10 people to describe the first time they

milligrams of THC each if you're new to cannabis start with half a serving and look there's even a helpful diagram the second thing has to do with the shape of the chocolate bar segments you do easily because you know using a square and do things that other chocolate bars do all the time where they just puts a logo on each 18 servings that just didn't seem fun to us so we looked at you know just other ways of just adding dimension to the bar day fonts they decided to go with pyramid shape segments but it wasn't easy there are three different shapes in every 18 seconds our and davon say needed all of them to contain the same concentration of cannabis so they enlisted the help of a mathematician to ensure that all three shapes have the same volume that might seem like a minor detail but like every other aspect of this chocolate bars design it's a premium touch that actually adds to the experience those details add up and they're about to matter a lot more just a few months California and several other states will vote on whether to legalize weed for recreational use which means that a marketplace that's already flooded with options is going to become a lot more crowded it's this kind of attention to detail that's going to really set products apart", "ohxDUez4AoI": "real quick before this video starts only only 2.8 of my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "0AgMNpFGP_o": "test test today I am going to talk about a product that I'm highly excited about been quite a while that I got so excited and for a while I even thought that I was gonna sort of skip product reviews if all these brands started following the same pathway what's there for me to discover it's gonna be really boring but this thing is legit it's something that you might have seen on the socials on the instagrams on the interwebs chocolate infused with CBD ladies and gentlemen I introduce to you the loft Chuck Sibley infused raw chocolate bar so I agree there is a huge hype around CBD I tried capsules I tried drops I tried weed again I can't talk in Dutch at the moment it's really complex and all these things they have their own advantage and they have their own benefit so to say but when it comes to dosage and when it comes to the effect of the CBD the chocolate bar is a big big winner one of the things that is good to keep in mind is that this is raw chocolate this cacao is processed on their low temperatures because what regular chocolate what happens is that it gets heated up and you lose a lot of the good stuff that chocolate has to offer let's look at some more facts [Music] the bar comes in five equal parts which I really like because it means you can dose quite accurately there's around five milligrams oh man it's so good I really took my time and consumed a whole box of these bars over the last week I've build up a little bit of a tolerance we'll talk about that later on but what I also noticed is that these bars for me they work the best in the in the evening at like two hours after I had dinner because it prepares me for sleep in such a good way it could be placebo because my brain could tell me amitayus instead of those drops or instead of those CBD capsules why don't you take a nice little sweet chocolate bar there's a bit of sugar in there there is flavor Nevada that you know tell my brain to go like so that's something that I keep in the back of my head when consuming these nonetheless I don't really care that I indulge in this chocolate pleasure because the sugar content is 18.9 grams per hundred gram this bars 35 grams which means that you consume this much of sugar with a whole bar I've seen way worse results in terms of sugar consumption when it comes to chocolate bars yeah okay so the texture hold up texture wise this chocolate is very fragile so normally with chocolate you have to really chew on it or you have to let it melt in your mouth and then you get some sort of a liquid substance with these bars if you chew on them they become a little bit more gritty and very texturized as if they as if the bar consists of tiny little pieces of cacao did user to crush with your teeth and then they become smaller and it's sort of like I really dig that experience because normally with chocolate there's hardly any texture which is fine I mean that's chocolate but here you definitely taste chocolate but the texture is from another planet in terms of structure it doesn't resemble chocolate at all the CBD that is used in this bar is sourced from Metis hemp and they have quite a name when it comes to producing bio-organic CBD oil and CBD products because in this Wild Wild West landscape of CBD product right now it's easy to purchase something that says buy organic but then do they I have to write certificates is it really buy organic not that easy to you know figure out if that's true if you head over to the website of many hemp the link is in the description and you go to Cavalli tight over there there you will find all the certificates for each of the products that they sell its me this transparency which just gives me a lot of trust because I use CBD quite often I want to know where this comes from if it's trusted but also I want to know that it is exactly 15 milligrams right now I've worked my way up to a pretty good tolerance for two bars at once this gives me a real nice smooth gooey feeling I've ate three bars as well all at once that got me sort of more wavy so I'm curious if you would eat a whole box this may be interesting experiments to do once hmm that's it for now I hope you see me in the next one ciao", "3wD0KpsGIhI": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats and it is tincture time guys one of my favorite things to review here on your marijuana review show uh we are taking a look at a product from select we've reviewed quite a few things from select in the past they're sort of the jack of all trades of uh marijuana companies we've reviewed carts i think i've reviewed um disposables um they're in a lot of different uh markets select they're selling a lot of different products and one of those is the tincture and they have a pretty uh wide tincture line now have had it for a while with a whole bunch of different kinds of dosages and mixtures between thcs and cbds and different potencies and yada yada yada so this one here i purchased at a dispensary in long beach for 50 i believe um and it is a pretty good value for what you get inside of this box and it is a little confusing i'll show you here um so this is a one to one tincture uh one to one thc cbd one milligram for one milligram however that's not actually true uh it does say there this is the unflavored 500 milligram thc 500 milligram cbd well actually there's a sticker up here clarifying it's actually 600 milligrams thc and 513 cbd so you get a little extra great who doesn't love that uh and then uh as i said this is their unflavored i think they also have like lemon and ginger other things uh and on the side we've got our dosing uh sort of guidelines um they recommend that each full dropper is 10 milligrams which is a single serving and they say this whole uh tincture bottle has 60 droppers in total which makes sense for 600 milligrams of thc um so we've reviewed a lot of tinctures here i really like tinctures uh they usually work pretty well for me and i absolutely love the form factor uh we'll be doing this one sublingually like we do with most of our tinctures under the tongue which means it actually comes on quite a bit quicker than if you were just taking it like any other edible uh the effects can start to hit as soon as about 15 minutes and really get going at about 45. um so uh let's go ahead and get this open i was looking okay so this is uh an mct oil based um tincture i was wondering what their base was and it is mct oil which is basically just coconut oil so it is coconut oil but just a specific uh chain of molecules i guess um okay so let's open her up our one-to-one drops now i'm not particularly a big cbd guy uh it's not something that is especially um helpful or useful for me i i don't really um uh get a lot of benefit from cbd uh more power to everybody who does i'm i'm glad you really enjoy it uh i don't dislike cbd it's just it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on me but i will definitely keep an eye out uh because this one is almost equal parts cbd in here as well we'll see if that makes me feel any different than the normal thc review uh so like all of our weed reviews we're gonna do uh or excuse me tincture reviews we do uh 100 milligrams not the whole thing and not just a single dropper i like to do that as our baseline for pretty much every tincture so that would mean 10 full droppers of this is going to be our dose we'll see how that goes uh i'll probably do three or four two or three four on camera with you and then the uh remainder that i will be doing the next you know six seven i will probably do on a live stream i've been doing a lot of live streaming thank you to everybody joining in um and i'll probably do uh a little bit more there so i hope to see some of you guys join in for our live streams anyways i'm going to shut up now and i'm going to go and open this up and get this process started smells like nothing at all not a thing okay i'm expecting this to taste uh very neutral uh as mct oil tinctures normally are uh not able to get the full milligram it's only about the 75. got to keep that in mind i have to do uh maybe closer to 13 drops in total uh hung ahaha [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all i'm gonna do um i i there are uh various opinions about how long you should leave it i usually go for about a minute or two and that seems to do the trick pretty well uh and as i i suspected largely tasteless just that vaguely kind of coconutty oil aftertaste um but it's so un you know it's just it's it's really uh it's not a big deal at all i took three droppers full and don't even feel like i uh need to rinse my mouth out or anything um so in terms of the uh unflavoredness of this tincture it is really unflavored um so we've done our first three or two and a half worth droppers there i've got another you know we'll say 10 to do because i wasn't able to get the full one dropper uh and as i said i'm gonna hope to do some of that with you guys on a live stream uh before i wrap this review up oh i think i forgot to mention uh like all of our wheat's reviews after i do my 10th dropper or so uh about two hours or so after that i'll come back here and let you guys know if this select one to one cbd thc tincture is as good as i am hoping until then stay high stay healthy hi guys i am back about three and a half hours after our first journey with the select one to one drops 600 milligrams of thc in the very specific 513 milligrams of cbd that's not how much i did i did about between 100 and 150 milligrams would be my guess which is probably between 80 and 120 milligrams of cbd and a lot of you got to hang out with me while i was reviewing this we did a little bit of a live stream and i appreciate everyone who tuned in uh and to all those who were there you probably remember that i liked this quite a bit this is very good um an affordable tincture i see it for about 50 bucks normally which is already a good deal for 600 milligrams of thc then you get the added bonus of that one to one cbd double-year cannabinoid goodness um so normally the cbd stuff doesn't really do a lot for me i'm not a big big big huge user of cbd or even sort of i don't really get the uh too much of the positive effects uh i respect it as a product it's just not super effective on me but i did notice it here um the the the high i'm experiencing is way more relaxed even than normal um sort of very very pleasant kind of experience less cerebral than normal for me not really neurons really aren't firing quite as much but i feel very at peace so i'm going to attribute that to the almost equal amounts of cbd in here so this select one-to-one unflavored drops it gets a really really big thumbs up for me i like it quite a bit my dog's thinking about barking but she's not going to she's not going to she really wanted to um so yeah huge thumbs up for me and before i bounce here guys i want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy that i can share with you that isn't necessarily about wheat in this one you may not want any weed before you check this out because it might be a little too much i'm going to recommend a couple of books from a japanese uh illustrator it's manga i'm sorry i'm a nerd i guess it's only the second one i've ever read so don't judge me too harshly um the artist and writer is a guy by the name i apologize if i'm mispronouncing it junjie ito um and the two books i want to recommend from him that are utterly grotesque i mean truly some of the most shocking images i've ever seen somebody uh put pen to paper but i mean that in the best kind of way uh they are depraved in the most uh wonderful kind of cosmic hori sense of depraved uh and those are guillot geo again probably mispronouncing it which means fish in [ __ ] japan um and uh the other one is uzumaki which means spirals and it's all about spirals and i think adult swim is gonna do some kind of adaptation i've talked a lot about genji ito don't mix the two that's my advice definitely try this and definitely give junjie e2 a shot if you're a fan of gross stuff but keep them apart all right guys well that's going to do it for this review here on wheats really like the select give a huge recommendation my boy genji whatever however i'm sorry i'm still very high so thank you so much for watching guys stay high stay healthy and we'll see you for the next review i'm hoping my dogs aren't going to trip they might we did it [Music] you", "jqREXCan8fw": "welcome back to my channel you guys it's your highness the channel that does video reviews and commentary on all things cannabis and I know I haven't been around for like a year but I'm here and I'm back so today I'll be doing a review on big fella hemp oil chocolate bars and they were really kind enough to email me and reach out and so I'm giving my full honest review on this product and they even sent me a pamphlet that I will read to you guys and it's really interesting I've never had a hemp oil chocolate bar before specifically from this brand so I'm pretty excited to try it and share it with you guys okay so this is what this says hmm it's non-gmo organic vegan gluten free natural flavors kosher and a third-party tested by Evo labs Evo but that's cool and the paragraph here says big fella bar uses a full spectrum hemp oil while using European chocolate manufacturing techniques and a proprietary process to provide the patient with an organic milk chocolate bar that has a dosage of 100 milligrams per bar a pimp oil interesting so it also says at the bottom that it provides the patient the ability to medicate daily and so each piece is 10 milligrams so it'll be about one each day so for 10 days that is what one of these bar bars contains and it's really interesting it also gives a little bit of the background about the owner I guess this product was designed and created by Andre from Bramwell of Candyman vending big fella bar has created a complete symbiosis of health and wellness by providing organic ingredients infused with the highest quality hemp oil ok so without further ado I will I'm gonna open this up and show you guys what it looks like so once you get the slide open you just pull it out like normal I guess and oh my god I do not have my nails done so excuse me but that's what it looks like just a regular candy bar and then you can see each one has about 10 milligrams each so if you are a low tolerance person you probably only take you know like one but since I'm a high dosage tolerant high tolerance person then I will probably take at least two sometimes three that's just me personally okay so this is what it looks like when it's out of the wrapper and it's just like a regular almost like the size of a KitKat bar and it breaks off really easy so I will eat this small block mm-hmm I'm super good it tastes just like a milk chocolate bar like a Hershey's like the way it melts in your mouth mmm and you don't really taste any luck the oil used really that's just not because I'm used to just eating out of bowls but it literally tastes like a Hershey's bar mmm it's really good I really like how it tastes and I'm not sure how the effects are I'm not too sure if it's supposed to make you feel sleepy for sure hemp oil you know is supposed to be like similar to CBD but not really in a way it's supposed to make you feel calm and you know make you feel soothed then just like there are health benefits to it don't get me wrong hemp is a really great source of just nutrients and you know the receptors in your body that we need so I recommend that you guys if you're looking for any type of hemp oil chocolate bar that this is one of the best ones that I've tried not just because I'm this is my totally honest review yeah I've really not haven't had something that was so chocolatey and that was really similar to like a candy that I've had before so I hope that helps you guys out and yes you can give them a follow at big fella and let me know in the comments what you guys think so thanks I'll see you guys next time and I will try to make more videos", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to a friend subscribe here baby juice TV and stick as a comment below if you've got your own opinions bye", "04Z0HQWeXyQ": "[Music] [Music] Red Seal chef Marcel here with cannabis wiki today we're gonna be making our keto friendly chocolate bars using unsweetened chocolate some honey and some wonderful drops from our licensed provider Aurora the drops we're using today are 28 milligrams per mil we're gonna put about 6 in there which is gonna bring us about 168 so 56 per chocolate bar as we're gonna make 3 chocolate bars today I know my molds already are 2 ounces each so I know that one of these is 4 ounces that's gonna do my two chocolate bars and that speakers unsweetened chocolate and so we're gonna break this one in half and then we have our bowl on a double boiler just to make sure that the chocolate doesn't scorch so all it is is a pan on the bottom with some paper towel wrapped around the outside and then your bowl set nicely on top the reason for that is because when you're tempering or melting chocolate it has a tendency to burn if you were to do it directly in a pan and once you burn or overheat chocolate you can't use it anymore so we've got our chocolate in there we're gonna add about a tablespoon of honey and I'm using a raw organic honey and then we're also going to add our drops so in order like I said to make it 168 milligrams total we're gonna put 6 droppers in and that's gonna give each one of our bars about 56 milligrams I'm gonna take about ten minutes for our chocolate to melt down so we'll let that melt and then we'll come back and put it in the mold so now that our chocolate is melted what we're gonna do is we're gonna scoop it into our chocolate bar molds that you can pick up at any of your craft stores or any of the online shops [Music] and then I normally scoop it all to one side in the middle first and then I'll spread it across to make sure that all the bars get filled up I'm not using anything fancy to spread it around it's just a plastic putty knife that works best for me that's the exact same size as the mold so now that our chocolate is done we're gonna give it a little bang to make sure there's no air bubbles in it and then we're gonna set it in the fridge or freezer to cool now that the chocolate bars have set in the freezer for 15 minutes what we're gonna do is we're just gonna bend the mold just to make sure that it's cracked and then we're gonna pop them out and they'll pop out easily there's one of our chocolate bars so we remember that our chocolate bars are about 56 milligrams each so that would make each half a chocolate bar 28 milligrams so we have our three chocolate bars these are keto friendly because they're unsweetened chocolate we've added our honey as their sweetener you can add different things if you want into the mold you can add dried berries nuts whatever suits your taste mint oil anything like that in order to make the flavor 100% yours it's chef Marcel signing off with cannabis wiki have a great day and make sure you check all of our videos out online", "DzlN7MHiyEI": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you stop by and for all you awesome awesome subscribers welcome back thank you so much for helping me get to over that 50 000 mark i love you love you love you thank you so much so let's keep it going next stop a hundred thousand all right so for today what i am going to bring you is how to properly infuse chocolate yes that's correct so it is very warm in my kitchen right now at nights like 85 degrees so it is melting fairly quickly but this is properly tempered chocolate if it wasn't it would be a total mess i actually wouldn't be able to hold it about 83 degrees in my kitchen right now so as i said i'm going to show you how to properly do this i've seen a ton of recipes i've seen a bunch of people also doing their edibles where they're using coconut oil or butter now they may be using candy melts and if they use just a little bit they may get away with it however if they're adding any kind of amount of oil or butter to even candy melts it's not going to stay solid at room temperature really the only way is to infuse coconut sorry to infuse cocoa butter and then we add our cocoa butter to chocolate and then we temper that chocolate so i'm going to show you how to do all those steps and explain a whole bunch about cocoa butter temperatures and exactly what tempering chocolate means yeah a whole bunch of science and stuff that you probably don't really care about but you couldn't hear it anyway yay so um ingredients wise i'm going to kind of jump right into there there's not a whole lot ingredients all right so what we're going to need here is about half a cup of melted cocoa butter and you want pure cocoa butter so i picked up these um organic pure cocoa butter wafers so just nicer to work with because they're in these wafer forms otherwise it comes in block form not the easiest to work with so a half a cup is four ounces i use about five and a half ounces for a little blossom for a little bit of loss or whatever so i end up with a half a cup which is about four ounces there and you're going to want about two cups of chocolate or the amount of chocolate that you're going to need of what you're working with and you want to use a really good grade chocolate the better grade chocolate that you use um the better your product is going to taste and the better quality it's going to be as well you can also just take your favorite chocolate bar so it's dairy milk or jersey milk or i don't know any kind of type of bar you like lint you can use any of those um to infuse as well as long as you temper it you you can always take a tempered chocolate bar melt it and re-temper it and put it right back to where it was so i'm gonna show you um three ways to actually temper chocolate yay but let's get to the first step of actually infusing our cocoa butter so a couple of things with cocoa butter and why it's really difficult is cocoa butter burns at a very low point it will burn over 120 degrees fahrenheit um so trying to do it on the stove top nearly impossible even if you do it on a double boiler because water boils at 212. that is too hot if you put it on super super low and on a like a minimum and a mine simmer and really monitor the temperature you may be able you've got to keep it at about 100 degrees fahrenheit so it's really difficult to try and do on the stovetop can't do it in the magical butter of the magical butter machine because its lowest temperature is 135 degrees fahrenheit too hot it will be completely burned i know because i did it they liked me on one of those websites the main guy who does it i can't remember his name so the levo is perfect for this because you can set your temperature to exactly what you need it to be so this way i'm going to set it to 100 degrees that's what's really nice about the levo or a machine that you can customize your temperature settings because all oils are not created equal for example cocoa butter like i said will burn over 120 degrees fahrenheit whereas olive oil it's like got like a 200 and something i shouldn't probably look that up it's got a way higher burn point so for infusing you would do that in around 180 mark um butter if it is not clarified will burn at about 250 uh 350 if it's uh clarified so even though they're all oils and fats or lipids they all have different smoke points and that's why when you're looking at getting a machine you really want one that you can customize your heating that's the main part you want to be able to customize your heating so onward and forward enough babbling about that for now trust me again not more science worrying about chocolate a little bit all right so infusing our cocoa butter very simple so i do apologize i have to keep my talk about certain things wink wink um very limited so you kind of have to read between lines on this i do apologize youtube is getting very very very sticky so i have to be very careful about what it is that i say and do so i have got about seven genes of my flower in my pod here i am going to set my cycle to activate and i've got it set to 240 30 minutes pop her in and let her go press start so it'll go to warming up then once it's warmed up it'll say activate and it'll give you the time and it'll count down the time the other nice thing is you can always pause and restart your uh infusion without affecting your time or anything so that's a nice feature of that as well so enough about that while that's activated we'll be back in 30 minutes so see here right now it's an activating mode or it's it's heated up so we've got um 30 minutes of 240 and it counts down and when it's done it says activation complete or something like that okay so our activation is complete now and we remove the pod to let it cool down you can leave it in the machine it's going to take a lot longer to completely cool down so i take it out you can even leave it on the counter for about 40 minutes i pop it into the freezer for about 10 minutes all right so my flower is nice and cool the pod goes back in our little uh rubber magnetic goes into the middle and we're gonna pop in our cocoa butter so this is the thermometer this is what regulates the temperature so once the oil or the butter itself reaches that temperature of what we sent it to it shuts off the machine itself is not necessarily going to be at 100 degrees it's once our oh once our cocoa butter hits 100 degrees the machine the heat will shut off and it will maintain it maintain the cocoa butter at that temperature whereas when you do it on the stove top what happens is is the temperature just stays because it goes by the element and your cocoa butter will just continue to increase in heat until it finally burns tada so that's it for that you put the lid down we now choose our uh our infuse cycle i'm going to lower the temp to 95 actually 100 i'll do it to 100 for two hours hit go because our butter was already warmed up there it didn't have to take time to warm up that's why i melted heat it up first so it's going to be infusing for two hours we'll come back and check that out when that's done but in the meanwhile sorry i will go over the equipment that we're going to need for the chocolate and give you a little bit of science into chocolate tempering and why it needs to be done and what actually happens behind the magical seams of chocolate so the equipment would need far more equipment than we do and do ingredients for our chocolate we only need two for the chocolate for the equipment we need a little lack of it so we're going to need a double boiler if you're going to do the double boiler method or you can melt your chocolate in the microwave if you do melt in the microwave do it in plastic in plastic containers that are microwave safe reason is plastic doesn't heat up so if you do it in glass or ceramic bowls they can heat up and create hot spots and actually burn your chocolate it gets much hotter than what you're doing plastic it doesn't heat up just make sure that it is microwave safe when microwaving start at 30 second intervals do two thirties again depending on the amount of chocolate that you're doing so for the two cups if i were to do that in the microwave i would do two rounds of 30. each time stirring it really really well in between um time intervals so i do 2 30 then i go to 20 seconds 15 seconds and then continue at 10 second intervals until it is completely melted so that's the microwave method way i do find the double boiler is a lot easier because you don't have to keep opening the door and stirring it and this and that just gets done here so totally though your preference so double boiler you can using a proper double boiler or any bowl metal bowl or glass heat safe glass bowl your water you want to make sure that it is low enough that it is not touching the bottom of your bowl again it is it will make your chocolate too hot and it will cause it to burn you'll want a straight edge spatula your chocolate molds so you can get silicone chocolate molds i don't particularly recommend them they are inexpensive but they're difficult to work with they're flimsy they're difficult to smack them down just a little hard to work with as well as they don't give you us a nice shine as the plastic or the best ones are actually the polycarbonate molds they are a little bit more expensive but they do give you a beautiful professional finished chocolate and they're sturdy they're nice and sturdy good for smacking out all the air bubbles we're going to need some parchment paper just for working and catching stuff you can use wax paper candy thermometer or thermometer or you can use a chocolate tempering one now this one other than telling you the um temperatures on the side here it's a pretty useless bachelor because one you have to have your chocolate submerged so far but we're working with chocolate and if anybody knows it's not very see-through so it gets mucked up your um spatula here makes it very difficult to read so really other than these uh spatula part of the edge and just having the convenience of the temperatures right there it's pretty useless but i got it anyway you're going to need a whisk a sharp knife for chopping up your chocolate now if you do if you're going to do the tabling method you're going to need two straight edge blades but that's just one particular method and you want a pair of rubber or latex gloves working with your finished chocolate so you don't get fingerprints all over it so i'm pretty sure that's pretty much all the equipment again you know me i always forget something so we're gonna finish up our infusion and then we're gonna get our chocolate made all right so our infusion is complete uh remember that thing i forgot to tell you you want either a fine mesh strainer or one of those bags those really fine mesh bags that magical butter or brewer has they're really good or cheesecloth they work really handy as well so the pod does keep out most of it but really fine sediment does get through so while that's all there is to it we push our button to to get down to our cocoa butter oh look at that and then you can just use this box not much is left in but you can just use a spatula just to scoop the rest of that down that's what's so nice about this so clean don't get your hands all gross and icky and you get pretty much all of your uh butter back which is a bonus and there we go that's it we now have our infused cocoa butter so we're going to let that cool down to room temperature it's not going to solidify i just want that temperature to come down so that we're working with the same temperature and chocolate and cocoa butter and i just wanted to show you comparison to just regular cocoa butter so there we go check those out isn't that sweet i can't wait to get onto the chocolate portion yay not really i don't like tempering any better all right so on to our little science portion of our chocolate before we actually make it so to explain to you in very simplistic turns i'm gonna make this i'm gonna dummy it right down why tempering is important what actually happens so this chocolate bar i just melted with some cocoa butter and set it didn't do any temperature and you can see as soon as i pick it up and hold it it begins to melt in my hands right away and it's just mushy and yuck so that is that's chocolate that is not tempered which is why you can't just melt a chocolate bar and put your stuff in and then put it back into a mold that's what's going to happen when you when it's tempered as you can see i can hold the chocolate and it's not melting in my hands it's not melting my fingers the chocolate breaks apart cleanly so what makes that happen why what is the difference between this and this when we melt chocolate well i'm gonna give you that right now okay so when we temper chocolate some really cool magic happens um when we're melting and the temperatures that we go between so the reasons why we need to bring it up to a certain temperature bring it down to a certain temperature and then bring it back up that's called our v shape and what happens in that process is there are six crystals that are created when we melt our cocoa butter or we melt chocolate sorry with cocoa butter so as you're melting it these crystals start to form in your chocolate and what happens so we've got all our different colors we've got pink yellow green and all these are what uh crystals one through six let's say the only crystal that we care about is crystal number five which is our beta crystal and those are going to be our green crystals or what i'm going to use as our demo for beta crystals those are the crystals that give your chocolate stability so it gives it its shine and what happens is it creates a chain and and to give your chocolate that stability during during the heating process so as we heat our temperature up all these crystals are made and they're all over the place and as you can see that's pretty unstable that's why our chocolate is really soft and blue because those crystals are just like that when you just melt and go when we bring up when we are tempering chocolate and we melt it to our optimal temperature and there's different temperatures for milk chocolate and dark chocolate i'll go over those a little bit later when we're doing it so these crystals are starting to form so there's a few different methods for creating our beta crystals one is just by adding already tempered chocolate melting that in i'll get into those separate processes so what's happening is we're introducing beta crystals so they said they're going to be our green ones as our temperature comes down the beta crystals start to form together they start to join up make friends while our other crystals are starting to melt away as our temperature is coming down and again if we keep keep working and agitating these beta crystals continue to build a nice solid chain which gives our chocolate our stability like so as we bring the temperature we get down to our optimal temperature then we need to bring it back up what that does is helps to remove and dissolve the remaining crystals remaining five crystals that we don't need essentially leaving us mainly our beta crystals in a nice form solid chain like so and that is very simplified version of what tempering chocolate does like i said people go to school for this and like there is i could get into some serious detail but seriously most of you don't want to hear that so let's get on to the uh tempering techniques and let's actually get some chocolate made okay i'm working forward to the good stuff the real chocolate so i've got here uh two cups of chocolate uh real milk chocolate the way to know the difference if you have real chocolate or compound chocolate or a melting chocolate just take a look at the ingredients if it has real cocoa butter it's real chocolate if it has palm oil or any other type of lipids then it is a compound or a melting chocolate or a candy melt so that's the easy difference real it has cocoa butter real chocolate needs to be tempered as i said you can take your favorite chocolate bar so we put our little candy melts into our bowl turn my heat on to medium low to low keep it on the lower end and i'm going to add in a tablespoon of cocoa butter get the cocoa butter all over your chips again this is going to help with even melting and even heating oh it helps if i actually plug this in that might help good yeah because i'm using the little um wafer chocolates i'm i didn't bother to chop it up i probably should have you should still chop it up oh you should still chomp oh my god even though i'm using i'm using this a nice thin little wafer so they do melt really nice and easily i still probably should have chopped it up into smaller pieces just to help it melt quicker but no big deal but if you're using the block chocolate you want to either grate it or make sure to chop it really really really fine so another very important thing when working or working or tempering chocolate is your uh is your atmosphere you want a very cool and dry atmosphere so around 70 72 is optimal it's really really good if you're getting up into the high 70s low 80s it makes it extremely extremely difficult virtually impossible to temper chocolate because you can't quite get it down to the low enough temperature so so for example it's 82 degrees in your home we want to bring our temperature on our chocolate down from 100 degrees down to 82. well if it's not cooler around us we're never going to get that temperature down so then you can either try doing things like doing it in front of an open refrigerator or over a fan which is actually what i'm going to do because it's kind of a little too warm in my place to call to probably get this correctly tempered but my little trick of what i'm going to have to do is uh do my stirring over my band which i tested yesterday and it worked so yay so as your chocolate is beginning to melt you want to make sure to just continually stir it to bring the warm from the bottom to the top and you're just getting all the chocolate coated again so they evenly melt and you don't want the chocolate to uh get too hot in one spot to burn that burn very easily i'm going to drop that down below now like my heat because i can feel it's getting pretty warm so because i'm doing milk chocolate i want to melt this to between 104 degrees fahrenheit and 113 fahrenheit i'm going for the 104 the lower end so that's for milk or white chocolate if i were doing dark chocolate you would go between 113 and 120 our chocolate is beginning to melt so as this melts as this melting is happening our little scatter our little crystals here are starting to form like so all scattered all over the place our chocolate here is pretty much melted so i'm going to check his temperature now so we're at 104 tickety-boo we're good to go part one to return our heat off so our first method of tempering is you take a large piece of tempered chocolate milk chocolate same type of chocolate and you're just going to dump that in and you're just going to continue to roll this over move chocolate over and start melting this bar into our chocolate we're going to continue to do this until our temperature comes down to as i said to eight between 86 and 88 for our milk chocolate so what this does in this method is we're already taking a tempered barn that has those beta crystals and we're melting those beta crystals and giving our chocolate a jump start by bringing it down to the temperature those beta crystals are going to chain up and um and do our chocolate temper our chocolate honest is probably one of the easier methods of doing it right now i'm at 97 it's going to take a little while so i'm going to do them pulling my fan over here and i'm just going to sit the bowl on the fan this is going to help me get this to temperature otherwise it's probably not going to happen so i'm just going to continue to flip the chocolate bar over making sure to get all the chocolate covered over and keep moving it around and you'll see it'll start to get shinier once you um start tempering chocolate getting used to it you'll actually be able to eyeball it once it's done it gets very you get to know its texture and its look there's no streakiness and it's shiny about at 92 little ways to go a little bit further so we need to bring this between 86 and 88. now normally your chocolate bar would be bigger to make sure that it lasted the whole time i probably could end up melting this whole chocolate bar in but that's okay so if you did have a large piece your chocolate left when you got to temperature you would just remove that piece and as you're as your chocolate is starting to come down in your temperature have a look and see if you see streaking if you see any kind of streaking it's not tempered correctly oh i think my chocolate chocolate is looking good i'm not seeing any noticeable type of streaking or separation color and it looks shiny so because i have some larger chunks of chocolate in there i'm gonna actually run that through a mesh before i put it in as i put it into my mold this is where we want our parchment paper so i'm using this just to catch any of the large chocolate bits that might might come through [Music] take our straight spatula and take your spatula and just move your chocolate that's nice and nice and flat and filled and then you want to take her and clean off the front edge then you want to take her and smack down get out the air bubbles all right so there is our method number one now number two is pretty much the same so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add in some fresh chocolate into here we'll get that remounted to our 104. so method number two is the v this is one of the um the b method is probably the one of the most used for beginners so this is where we bring the temperature we bring it up to the 104-113 i said for milk chocolate i keep it around 104. we're going to bring it down to between 82 and 85 and then we are going to bring it back up to between 86 and 88 so that's our little b motion our little b so if i was starting from scratch i would be adding in a tablespoon of my can of cocoa butter but because i've already got that in there and i'm just re-melting chocolate and that's why i haven't added it to it the awesome thing about chocolate is that you can melt and re-temper it over and over and over as long as you don't burn your chocolate or seize your chocolate you're good to go just remember water is chocolate mortal enemy so you want to make sure all your equipment that you work with with chocolate is completely dry absolutely no water it's one reason why i don't use wooden spoons or anything with wooden handles because they have a tendency to hold on to moisture and you can be stirring away and your chocolate starts seizing on you and you don't know why because the moisture very little moisture is seeping in from the wooden handle so i tend to avoid wood okay we're definitely attempt so now for this method what we need to do is we are going to add you're going to get some additional of your chocolate that you've got so you were chopping up chocolate if you got your two cups you would split it out two-thirds and one-third you put two-thirds into melting you'd keep one-third on the side and what we're going to do is just add a little handful at a time and continue to stir and you want to stir very fairly vigorously this helps the beta crystals and we're going to continue to do this until we bring our temperature down to like i said to 82 and then those little as those melt in add in some more and i'm probably gonna have to move over to my fan to get this down to temp the temperature that i need i'm gonna add in some more my other ones are melted well that's gonna take a while so i'm just gonna get the last of my chocolate added in here my last one third and continue stirring vigorously sweet all right so we're there so i've got this down to 85 so now we take our pot there should be enough heat just from the hot water there place your chocolate back on and we're going to stir this and bring this back up to between 87 and 89. and what's happening in this process is this temperature is coming up now those remaining crystals that we don't want are melting off melting away and as your chocolate starts to come up into temp you're going to start to see it get shinier so as i said once you start to temper a few times you get to know what it looks like so you um becomes a lot easier so not quite enough heat from my pot here so i'm just going to throw it on the low here on my stove almost there's a couple more degrees and you can see the chocolate is shiny you don't see any streaking layer in the mold spatula then make sure to give her a good smack out for all the air bubbles now our last method our third method here is called tabling so we don't add um additional chocolate and we don't have to worry about temperature it creates the beta crystals by agitation so this is when we are going to use um our two straight edge blades and in order to do tabling you have to have a marble uh stove to work on or a natural stone top otherwise she no work right so pretend i'm starting with new chocolate again i would add in a tablespoon of my cocoa butter and melt that all together so again i'm just going to melt this until we get to 104 that's the only temperature we want to worry about is our what we're melting our chocolate to which is above 104 between 100 and 413 i'm going to stir my chocolate until it gets up to 104 degrees fahrenheit we've reached our temperature of 104 degrees fahrenheit remove your chocolate from the heat now make sure your working table is completely clean and we're going to dump our chocolate out onto our table now you're going to get your straight edge blades and you're going to start working your chocolate back and forth all over through between the two blades and what we're doing is we're creating agitation which is what's going to create our beta crystals doing the tabling method and you want to smear it out nice and flat this will help with the cooling and the temping and you're going to continue to work the chocolate like this until we get to 8 between 86 and 88 degrees fahrenheit for the tabling method you want to have experience with tempering so by eyeball you know it's when it's in temper so you only have to do a temperature check once [Music] [Applause] [Music] my chocolate's looking good so i'm just going to check the temperature and we're good we're at 87.5 perfect and next we're just going to get our chocolate back into the bowl so just use your two straight edges scoop up your chocolate back in the bowl so now i'm just going to be pouring my third method into the mold so we just layer down fill up the mold move her around to fill it to flatten her out and use your spatula to clean off the excess off the top clean off the sides of your mold and then give her a real good smackdown and shake back and forth to get out all the excess air bubbles and last thing we just need to let them set if your place is cool enough you can let them sit on the uh counter probably take about half hour 40 minutes however if not pop them into the refrigerator for about 20 minutes that should be good to set them up all right so our chocolate is all set up time to come out of the molds flip them over and they need a little bit more coaxing there we go looks like we've got three tempered bars look at those don't they look pretty so our test give her a give a hold it doesn't instantly melt in your hands you can touch it doesn't instantly melt good chance they're tempered even though it's cold and just came out of the fridge if they weren't they would instantly be melting okay let me clean this off so you can actually see properly so i can pick up the chocolate and i can touch it and it's not instantly melting into my hands it is going to melt somewhat a little bit because it is very warm but you would know the difference like it will melt melt and the other thing is when you go to break it it actually breaks if that wasn't tempered again even cold coming out of the fridge it wouldn't break it would more just bend trust me you know very quickly if it isn't tempered but as i said if it doesn't temper not a big deal chop her up put her in the pot give the method another try and then for packaging up your chocolate for storing or for um for packaging or whatever again in the summertime don't even attempt to ship chocolate it won't happen so what i like to use are these thin tin foil sheets they're already pre-cut put your chopped tip oils the best thing to use for um for wrapping up your chocolate so it just goes on there you want to kind of pull it tight and again you can wrap it up however you want i am not the best rapper even for christmas presents so i was so glad they came out with bags there you go there's your chocolate bar and then to make inexpensive wrappers you can just make our printouts on uh on your printer on regular 8x10 paper cut them out to fit and just give them a wrap up that's everything for you so i hope you enjoyed that video today on how to make cannon infused chocolate if you have any questions or comments at all please don't hesitate to put them down below i do love to

this is working this is working it feels like the first time I smoked some giggly I'm like a schoolgirl this thing is working and now not so much I kinda feel a little bit right here probably because I have an extremely high tolerance but you never know with these things as vice showed in a documentary they're always low barred with the THC content the milligrams but you never know I heard a lot

and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody welcome back you work berber cannabis in today's video i want to be showing you how i infuse our gummy recipe but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to the channel please consider subscribing and if you've already subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind give the video a big thumbs up so folks today I'm gonna be running through a lot of the ways you can infuse our gummy recipe that which we just posted at the same time as this video now the reason being is I want to make sure that that gummy recipe stays by itself and that I'll show you where along the line you could infuse that with that being said guys there are so many different ways to infuse this gummy recipe so I'm gonna take you through my favorite way and then bring you all the way to my least favorite way and I'll kind of explain why one is better than the other at least in my eyes so let's get right into it let me show you how I infuse our gummy recipe alright folks so now we're gonna talk about how I infuse our gummy recipe so first and foremost a couple of the things that I will be using you can find on Amazon and I'll leave all that information in the description below so hopefully you can check it out if you guys are interested in any type of flour or Keith don't forget you can always email me and that will be in the description below also so today folks we're going to talk about my favorite way to add CBD to our Gumby recipe and that is with Keef now this is a premium product for the cannabis plant you have to extract it whether it's dry extraction you can wet extract it although it's a lot more time consuming but you can go ahead and check out our video on how to extract Keef but this is by far my favorite way to add Keef to that gummy recipe now it has to be d carved and typically what I like to do is use 1 to 2 grams depending on how potent you want it and UD kharbut for approximately 15 minutes on two hundred and fifty degrees in your oven now the one downside to using Keith in the raw form and just adding it to the gummy recipe is that it will float to the surface and it kind of creates a weird surface on the gummy it's nothing you can't taste it really but it does create that weird textured surface only on one side of the gum the other side is perfectly fine and of course guys when I talk about infusing the recipe I'm gonna tell you exactly when to infuse it now this goes for everything that I'm going to show you today but the number one time the best time to infuse the gummy recipe is after the blooming stage so you were looking at our gummy recipe it's it's at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes and then we start to heat it up during that heating up process that is when you would add the key for any of these other things that I'm gonna go over so one of the ways I found that you could get rid of that texture in the gummy recipe if you use Keith is you can use sunflower lecithin or vegetable glycerin now when it comes to using these two things it doesn't really affect the recipe too much but it will dissolve the kief and the way you do it is you use about two tablespoons you put it in a little bowl like this you add all your ingredients you add your one to two grams of d carb Keith you mix it around as best you can try to dissolve it and then again you add that during the heating up process on the stove and you let it mix in and you continue to continuously mix it so this is by far my favorite way just adding raw keef I like to keep it on natural the texture does not bother me but if you want it like a store-bought gummy you're gonna have to use one of these two things I actually prefer the glycerin for the gummy recipe over the lesson but the lesson is well known for absorption so either one of these will work guys it's just your personal preference and what you like I know some people have a little bit of an allergy to vegetable glycerin not a lot of them but some do and so they go with less certain I I do not like the soil a certain I go with the liquid sunflower less it's in you can get granular but I don't really see the point in the granular for this process so definitely get the liquid less certain so that's that and using Keef and how and how I use Keef in the recipe the next thing I'm going to show you is an efficient way to add CBD to our recipe but it is not my favorite way by any means it gives a harsh flavor and honestly guys it's a little dangerous and you got to know what you're doing with this stuff and if you guys haven't checked it out yet go ahead and please do so on our how to make a CBD tincture recipe you can find that in the description below but here folks is our alcohol tincture now for this you will use a half a cup and you will cook it down on the stove and when you're cooking it down on the stove it becomes kind of pasty towards the end what you're doing is you're cooking off the alcohol because you don't want to really be making alcohol gummies and so once you do that you again you add it during the heating up process when making those gummies now when you add either is the key for the alcohol tincture when you're heating up that gelatin you want to really mix it in just really mix it in get it three to four or five minutes whatever it takes there's no rush just make sure you don't burn the gelatin keep it at a medium low temperature and just make sure that it's getting mixed in but I'm not even going to show you this today guys because I just do not like using this I did it at home I do not recommend it it's not my favorite way to do this at all so I will refer you to our friends over at the magical butter machine if you want to learn how to cook down your tincture but again guys you need a pan need on low temperature on a stovetop preferably electric folks and if you can do it outside it's best to do it outside the fumes are rough on the smell and it's just a really harsh way to do it but this is an efficient way to add CBD to our gummie recipe now these are the two ways that I really do not like it changes the entire texture of the gummy and it changes the flavor of the gummy and it gives it like this weird oily flavor and so folks you can use MCT or olive oil that's been infused already with CBD or you can use coconut oil and you're also adding about two to three tablespoons of coconut oil or MCT oil to the gelatin recipe you can add more if you want again that really depends on what you like and how strong you want it now here's the problem with using oil it changes the entire texture of the gummy it tends to float around and make it weird it also comes with a very similar harsh taste that the alcohol tincture has not as harsh and definitely a lot safer to use but the gummy itself it just doesn't look good and it doesn't really taste that good it's just not a great way to add it but however you can do it but it's just not the way I recommend it and again I'm gonna go back to D carb Keef and the lesson or glycerin if you want the nice looking gummy but you can just add straight Keith it's just the safest way to go folks and again if you are interested in Keith or flour to make your own at home feel free to email me that information will be in the description below but that is how I infuse my gummy recipe that is on our youtube channel and that link will be in the description below also I hope you guys liked this recipe and how we infuse our gummies if you guys have any questions feel free to send me an email leave a comment below and I'll get to you guys an answer them to the best of my ability again I'm not an expert at this but this is what I found works for me at my home and I hope it works for you guys too and that's all I have for today folks I hope you enjoyed today's video and as always take care and I will see you in another video", "bVHITaAjHpw": "hello and welcome to episode 16 of the ganja geezer here on a beautiful fall day afternoon in [ __ ] Denver Colorado today is going to be another review day today we're going to be reviewing medically correct blueberry bliss white chocolate bar it's our newest product from their Incredibles line of treats and I picked up this from the giving tree' dispensary here in Colorado package looks like this nice foil package let's try to get it in there they're left and right hundred milligrams of THC in a 45 gram white chocolate bar some viewers remain remember I reviewed the mile-high mint chocolate bar by this company and it contained 175 milligrams for ten dollars and this contains 100 milligrams I think it was for nine dollars so it definitely doesn't have as much bang for the buck on paper that the other one did so but on a good plus side I'm anticipating that this should taste much better because or taste better because it has a lower concentration my dose right now you know as I've been taking is around 25 milligrams so I'm thinking one quarter of this should do the trick again and I said it's a nice foil package and I have to say medically correct this company has the best professional packaging of any of the and Colorado edible manufacturers that I've come across so far the packaging clear labeling of the expiration date lot number and ingredients and the ingredients are white chocolate medical marijuana rice krispies blueberries contains milk processed and a facility that processes nuts a little boring there for anybody with nut salad nut allergies so now let's crack open this bad boy and give it a try use a little tear off here on the end just like the mile-high mint chocolate bar so make that out well that's not very attractive blue I mean truly blue that many blue foods in this world but um kind of looks like play-doh or something like that but I like the fact that it's segmented into nice cloth segments so you can determine titrate your death so I'm going to take three of these off blue really so just break off three here let's pop one of these in my mouth and see how it tastes Wow that is a tasty chocolate bar I barely taste anything this is amazing that is the best tasting edible I've had so far absolutely just a tiny bit of aftertaste but I mean that that tastes like a candy bar apart from the Smurf motif it's actually a really tasty to treat all right I'm just gonna take 20 milligrams right now and see how that does for me one thing I just wanted to show here after I put it back in the refrigerator looks like I've been playing with crayons or chalk nice and blue and your fingers instead of like orange fingers from Cheetos and get hello its next day I'd like to apologize for the rough transition just back then the audio started flaking out at the end of yesterday's recording and I had to clip out the good stuff and remove the inaudible stuff alright let's move on to the review I'm gonna go back and review taste of the blueberry bliss bar as I said this is the best tasting product had so far I could have eaten the entire arm chocolate bar for enjoyment although I would have been pasted to the ceiling if I had done so there was only a hint of aftertaste as I said before you know it was barely noticeable the only complaint I could give about this product is its appearance I mean the ingredient the ingredient list says there are blueberries in there but I'm I'm not blueberry extract or genuine imitation processed blueberry spread type stuff so I'm assuming based on that list that this was actual just like a blueberry puree that they just mixed in with the chocolate giving that disturbing aqua Smurf vibe I was expecting a white chocolate bar with chunks and blueberry in it you know kind of like you know cookies and cream type buy but I think maybe they could have gone with that to make it a little more palatable on the looks side but taste is words count and I'm gonna have to give it a 10 for taste I mean it was actually tasted like a nice chocolate white chocolate bar moving on to pain relief this is where it falls a bit short for me this seems to be a THC only product so I primarily experienced head effects and very little if any body effects at all and that's really what I'm looking for for the most part because those seem to help my back and my leg pain much more than anything else it's not necessarily a bad thing though because it does the THC the head-high does help distract from the pain but it actually doesn't suppress it in any way for me I'd also like to mention you know I'd give them kudos for segmenting the product into easily you know the little segments so you can easily determine your dose you don't have to break it off and estimate maybe I'm taking 1/3 maybe I'm taking quarter I think all edibles should consider doing this if their axe the actual product they sell isn't one serving size so in summary for pain relief I'm gonna have to give it a seven for pain relief and that was only because it could provide some distraction from the pain you know making the hamster wheel go faster in the brain with the THC so again pain relief has a rating of seven moving on to the third point of my rating scale is side effects and this since this was a head effect type medication THC I have to say it was a very manageable high I felt in control at all times and went for a long walk last night and felt just fine I had a bit of trouble falling asleep and that's going to hit me a little bit because by the time about five hours after I took I tried to go to bed and I was just too wired I guess is the word you'd use to go to sleep so it gave me a little bit of insomnia which I didn't like but in the morning I woke up and I felt clear-headed and rested so overall I'm going to give this a rating of eight for arms side effects and again written review eight the higher the number is better lower side effects so for everything the higher the number is better and the forth point of my um rating scale is value and I do this through the milligrams per dollar ratio and early interview I said I paid nine dollars for a hundred milligram bar that translates to eleven milligrams per dollar that's rounded down eleven point three actually and I took three of the twelve pieces pieces overall you only saw him eating two on the video but I took one about an hour later and that was 25% of the bar so I just say it this clear way it seems to be for me and people with um low tolerance ER for four doses in the bar so for nine dollars there are a lot better deals out there so I'm gonna have to give this a rating of seven out of ten forum value but I'd have to say if you were to get this on a buy one get one type deal you would jump on it because it is a good product especially if you're looking at something to relieve PTSD or some sort of depression issue think so we've got our four ratings in summer we have 10 for taste 7 for pain relief 8 for side-effects and 7 for value giving an overall ganja geezer rating of 8 all right that's it for now I'd like to remind everyone to please click the like button make comments down below or better yet subscribe to the channel later on in this month

that baby gets us high\nhi welcome back to the busy budtender I am the busy budtender the girl who\nsometimes likes to smoke weed online but also likes to educate you about cannabis\ncannabis lifestyle and how to integrate it into your world if you're interested in\nmore and learning about cannabis cannabis products in cannabis lifestyle\ndefinitely make sure to subscribe like this video hit the bell do it ever you'd\nlike to do to make sure you don't miss any of my videos without further ado\nthough let's take a look at the product that I'm actually gonna be talking about\nin today's video which I'm assuming is why you clicked it is the chowie wowie milk\nchocolate edibles as per usual with my reviews the first thing I want to look\nat is the brand and the licensed producer who actually makes the product\nthen moving into the product attributes unboxing my own tasting trying of the\nproduct itself and then finally my own recommendations and opinions so make sure\nyou stick around to the end to find out what I actually think about this product so chowie wowie the brand that we're looking\nat today who actually makes it chowie wowie is owned by a company called High\nPark which I recently spoke about in one of my videos they're based in Toronto a\nbig company that owns a lot of different brands and then above high park is of\ncourse tilray the big multinational corporation now Tilray as a licensed\nproducer my own opinion not my favorite licensed producer, not\nmy not favorite I don't really have any strong opinions on tilray yet I do\nknow that they're in multiple markets which is pretty cool cuz I'm always down\nfor bringing cannabis to more people but aside from that I really don't have any\nstrong opinions about tilray if you want to learn a little bit more about tilray\nor their brands I recently did a review about Canaca which is another one of the\nbrands that high park tilray owns which I pretty much enjoyed if you want to\ncheck out that video of course the links are gonna be wherever the heck I put\nthem so definitely check that out if you're interested\nso as for chowie wowie as a brand specifically chowie wowie exclusively does\nedibles so they don't do any dried flower no vapes but they do have two\ndifferent types of milk chocolates and some gummies today though we're gonna be\nlooking at the chowie wowie milk chocolate balance between 10 milligrams of CBD and\n10 milligrams of THC if you guys aren't familiar with the\ndifferences between THC and CBD they're pretty interesting\nyou're not like big cannabis nerds like me but THC is the stuff that makes\nyou high it's the thing that makes you uplift it it's the thing that you feel\nin your head and in your brain and does a lot of fun things for you\nCBD on the other hand is the more well on this side to the cannabis industry\nit's really good for inflammation and the really interesting thing that I\nwanted to talk about specifically with this product and CBD is that CBD is\nknown to counteract some of the effects of THC so THC sometimes can make\nyou feel anxious or paranoid or also in general just increases your heart rate\nCBD kind of like pulls the crank a little bit back which is why this\nproduct will be pretty interesting to try so in comparison with their other\nproduct which is a 10 milligram of THC exclusively I would likely expect a\nlittle bit more of an intense high rather than this one which is going to\nbe a little bit more balanced you can get the chowie wowie milk chocolate edibles\non the OCS which is Ontario's cannabis store for seven dollars and 20 cents so\nit's pretty affordable if you want to just try out some edibles it's not a\nit's seven dollars as for the packaging itself before I open this up I think\nit's pretty cute I I think chowie wowie's doing a decent job with the restrictions\nthey have with packaging in Canada that being said I don't see like a recycling\nsign on this so I'm not sure if this can be put in your curbside recycling\nprogram the alternative is I'm pretty sure that with every piece of cannabis\npackaging including stuff like this you can return it to stores that have\nrecycling programs but I'm not really quite sure about like specifically this\ntype of packaging I don't know I'm I'm a sucker for sustainability so\nit kind of sucks to buy cannabis and this kind of packaging but I'll talk a\nlittle bit more about the quantity of this product and the packaging a little\nbit later in the video anyways enough about that let's actually open this up\nand see what it looks like and smell it all right so let's get into the unboxing\non the front of the package we have our cute little chowie wowie logo milk chocolate big ass THC thing and then the total amount of THC\nand CBD which again is balanced at 10 milligrams and 10 milligrams and our big\nwarning about how it can take up to four hours to feel the full effects from\neating or drinking cannabis on the back we have our beautiful excise stamp\nwhich is the Alberta one because I'm currently in Alberta and then I actually\nreally like this on the back they wrote these balance chocolates are made with\n10 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD per piece each piece can be\neasily split into two squares to enjoy with friends I guess friend\nwe've recommend starting with just one square then waiting to feel the effects\nbefore having more while you wait you can invent backstories for strangers try\nnot to think about capybaras watch clouds done I think that's cute\nobviously cuz it's an edible this is unfortunately not a zero calorie product\nit has 80 calories per container and then you have all of the important\nnutrition facts over here the packaged on date is late December so December\n17th so right before edibles were actually released in Canada so it's not\nto to old and of course the ingredients which it just looks like it's kind of a\nmediocre chocolate with whole milk powder and blah blah blah whatever and\non cannabis extraction of course anyways enough about that let's actually see how\ndifficult this is to open all right and then normally with these\nkind of products you can see it's like a zip a zip lock issue thing close a zip\nlock type of closure so with these I'm pretty sure you're supposed to like yeah\nOh first try baby did you guys see that oh yeah you're supposed to twist it I\ndon't let's check this puppy out cute the interesting thing that I noticed\nwhen I was unboxing this is that it doesn't say anywhere on the packaging\nwhat type of strain the extracts have come from whether it's a indica sativa\nor hybrid according to sources online this is supposed to be a hybrid strain\nso something in between which is my favorite type of strain but it's pretty\nweird they wouldn't put it on the packaging anyways aside from that when\nyou open it up firstly as for the smell I'd say it smells like 80% chocolate 20%\nweed which isn't bad at all it does have a very slight dankness to it but it's\nnot overpowering and then as you can see from the unboxing it comes in these two\ncute little squares sorry cute little rectangles that you could split it with\na friend and then the chowie wowie thing on the front let me talk a little bit about\ndosing edibles and how they're different for everybody\nof course we as we metabolize and consume alcohol differently 3 beers is\ngonna be something extremely different than 3 beers is for someone of a\ncompletely different weight and height the same thing kind of goes with\ncannabis and edibles so what everyone recommends is to start low and go slow\nso with something like this where you have 10 milligrams\nit's recommended that you take ok let me see if I can break this open it's\nrecommended that you eat one of these wait like 2 hours I'd say before you\nhave any more as for me I'm actually gonna be taking both of these because\nnumber one my tolerance is probably a little bit heavier than that of most\npeople consider I consume a lot of cannabis throughout my weekly day-to-day\netc and also because I want to show you guys what taking both of these would be\nlike whether you're someone who has a higher tolerance like me or you're just\ncurious as to what that kind of experience is and if you're a beginner\nconsumer or have a lower tolerance in general my somewhat assumption is that\nmy experience taking both of these is going to be somewhat similar to what it\nwould be like are you taking just one alright let's\ntry it out hmm it tastes like like a Hershey's\nchocolate or like any other kind of cheaper but fine chocolate and then it\nhas like that dink aftertaste II presence it's not bad like I'm not like\ndisgusted like it's fine I think I'm just a snob when it comes to food and I\nwant us to taste good the flavors not bad it's really really not bad once you\neat more you can't taste the cannabis as much as just very much chocolate so\nmaybe that helps all right bottoms up and now we wait while I'm sitting here\nfor the next two hours and waiting for my edibles to kick in so I can give you\nguys the full spectrum of opinions that I always do have I do want to talk a\nlittle bit about cannabis 2.0 and how Canada made some mistakes in my opinion\nand maybe you guys can agree with me or let me know what you think in the\ncomments down below if you guys are edibles people if you enjoy the cannabis\n2.0 products in general what you think about the rules and regulations I'd love\nto know down below specifically what I'm talking about is this package which is\nthe 10 milligrams of THC 10 milligram CBD that is the highest legal amount\nthat you can have in a cannabis package in Canada in the legal market\nspecifically what I mean is the ten milligrams of CBD and THC in an edible\nproduct is the maximum amount in a package in Canada the reason I think\nthis is kind of bullshit is not only because of course I come from a\nbackground of experiences on the black market and when you purchase black\nmarket edibles it comes in a package roughly the same size but it's gonna be\na hundred milligrams or even 200 milligrams or more that being said it\ndoesn't mean that you should take a hundred milligrams of cannabis or 200\nmilligrams of a cannabis edible unless you want to do that what it means is\nthat you have multiple gummies or multiple pieces of chocolate that are\nbroken down into 20 or 10 milligram pieces or five milligram pieces and then\nas long as you have the information that you're giving the consumer that hey\ndon't eat this whole frickin package they're gonna be okay I think it's\npretty ridiculous that the government feels like they need to babysit\nconsumers in making such tiny packages for edibles it's it's like buying one\nbeer you don't want to buy one beer want to buy a 6-pack or you want to buy\na bottle of Smirnoff and it's not like and it's not like the government\nrestricts the amount of Smirnoff because they don't trust the consumers it's that\nthere's enough education and in society to know that you're not supposed to\ndrink a bottle of Smirnoff unless you're pretty wild the same thing goes with\nedibles I personally am under the belief that\nnot only would it be more sustainable in that this type of packaging could have\nway more uses to it rather than just a single time use for someone like me\nbut in addition yeah it just doesn't make sense it does make sense to have\nsuch a small package if you want to share a bunch of beers with friends you\ndon't bring one beer and then split it into small cups you bring a six-pack in\nthe cannabis realm in Canada you can't bring a six-pack and I just I don't know\nI think that the Canadian government is really really handicapping itself with\ncannabis 2.0 I hope that things will change in the future\nbut those are just my thoughts and opinions again I love to know yours I'm\ngonna get comfy I got my switch I got my animal crossing and I can tell you guys\nupdates as they come... guys look it's me I don't wear glasses in real life but\nI thought it looked cute this is my house tell me it's not just like a chill vibe\nI like it so update number one as you can see\nKingdom Hearts is playing in the background because I'm at my parents\nhouse and I thought why not be 14 again anyway so at the 15-minute mark what I'm\nstarting to feel is I'm definitely started to feeling something in my head\nand then I'm not sure if I was just hungry or a spurt of the edibles\nmunchies kicked in but I had a couple pretzels and I'm feeling a lot better so\nstay tuned for how the rest of this goes welcome to the 30 minute ish checkpoint I\nam definitely feeling quite baked and having a really really fun time I'm\nfeeling really uplifted my heart rate is a little bit fast but it's not too bad\nyeah I'm having a really good time honestly that's pretty much it but I'm\ndefinitely feeling a very very strong high at 30 minutes which is pretty good\nbecause a lot of times with the edibles that I make it sometimes at home or have\nhad in the past it can take like an hour or longer than that to feel the effect\nso feeling under 30 minutes is quite enjoyable\nthe downside of it is I do have some dry mouth which is like fine\nand I've been a little bit hungry but other than that I think this is a really\nreally fun time hello and welcome back it has been roughly three and a half\nhours since I last sat down here specifically and was talking with you\nguys I just wanted to tell you my entire experience what I think and my star\nrating so I personally really really enjoyed it I will say if you're an early\nuser do not take two of like don't eat the whole thing because that's probably\ngonna be too much for you but for me it was like a great time I really really\nenjoyed it I thought that the high was very uplifting very fun at times I felt\nlike my heart rate was a little bit high but that just might have been me and\nthat's not necessarily because of the strain and aside from being uplifted I\nwas also feeling quite chill so like a mix between it was a hybrid essentially\nwith the CBD I do feel a very nice body relaxing\nfeeling my body feels like I just did a nice hour-long yoga session with like a\n15 minute shavasana at the end which if you don't know what that means it means\nlike taking a nap after yoga essentially so it feels like I took a nice nap but\nI'm still feeling quite uplifted with the hybrid-ness of the strain so the\npros and the cons of the chowie wowie is in my opinion the negative side is that\nfrankly I don't think there's enough of the product in here because I think that\nit's actually pretty good and then on the positive side I think that the high\nwas really enjoyable and fun especially with the THC and CBD aspects to what I\nfeel like I almost come out of here feeling better than I was before yeah\nthat's it it's a pretty solid product so what\nwould I actually pair this with if you're gonna watch something well I'm\ngonna say that because for me the high was a little bit more intense with the\nentire chocolate bar chocolate Square whatever is I would watch something that\nI've already seen before so for me that would be like as series like Gilmore\nGirls or maybe community or if you wanted\nsomething new something like haikyuu is what I would be watching right now so I\nthink that kind of chill TV show that you've already seen or maybe are okay\nwith seeing and that being said something that's still gonna be\nuplifting to encourage that part of the strain I think would be perfect\nso what star rating should I give this mmm I'd say a 3.75 am I allowed to do\nthat it's my channel to do that I'm going to give this a 3.75\nout of 5 the reason I'm gonna give it a 3.75 and\nnot four is because I'm like it's good like I really enjoyed it and like the\nprice points pretty chill but it's not like incredible and I think as of right\nnow the industry frankly only has things that are around the four star mark for\nlike their top I'm hoping that in the future in the next year or so can it'll\nbe able to push it a little bit and give us some five star products but for now\nwe're gonna aim for four stars so that's why I give this a 3.75 anyways that is\nall for me thank you guys for joining me on today's review and let me know have\nyou

"T9WX93x9IIQ": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time another tko edible but chocolate dipped cheerio flavor um if you've never heard of tko edibles or tko in general they also they're a black market company they make edibles and also cartridges um i'm not a fan at all of their carts but uh i think their edibles are pretty decent um nutritional facts nine servings per container serving size one square um it comes in a three by three row um you can pause it there for all the rest of it 0.7 grams of stuff because the serving size is so small tko extract oil 35 milligrams per um little square you can pause that there for the ingredients if you need to i've reviewed these before and i believe last time um this packaging was not black i believe it was white but now it's like a matte black with a shiny silver tko and 315 written down because um total milligrams is 315. and i'm a big fan of this chocolate chip chocolate dipped cherry flavor um it honestly is mostly just milk chocolate but the only really difference is uh you flip it around as you can see there's some crispy crispy chunks in there um i guess i'm assuming there's probably cinnamon on them or something but yeah there's another one right there i'm honestly a big fan of this flavor uh it's kind of reminds me of like a crunch bar or something i definitely like this flavor more than some of the other tko ones i've tried but yeah they definitely work efficiently but you never know uh make sure you get these from someone you obviously trust and everything and be very careful with the dosha dosage just try one wait a while and then try more if you need to but um you never really know i forget if they have test results for these or not but um you never exactly know um from bar to bar i'm sure they're not exactly 315 milligrams each some might be 300 some might be 330 or something so if you're sensitive to edibles definitely um take less than you need to and then go from there and on on the front of the chocolates um got tko just just this bottom corner one says tko and the rest just say 35 mg with a raindrop but um if you tried these let me know what you think of them let me know your favorite flavor my dog just tried to get in there i'm sorry but um let me know what flavor you like out of all of these because there are a lot of tko flavors um i have a ton of videos like this on my channel and yeah peace out", "WOqkOX9w97g": "what's up everybody welcome to the tunnel today we're gonna be making cannabis peanut butter cup so let's get into it [Music] [Music]", "RUeTPeFCX4k": "Imagine taking your medicine by eating a chocolate bar or a chewing gum; this is the future that CBD Edibles are promising: A medical dose of CBD with a sugar coating to make the medicine more palatable. There are many edible CBD products such as cookies, granola, and lollipops that provide CBD to you while also satisfying the taste buds. CBD is a molecule obtained from the cannabis plant which falls in the category of cannabinoids. It has many health benefits. In order to have an effect on our body, CBD has to be heated; however, with CBD edibles, the manufacturers activate it beforehand, and all you need to do is ingest it. This makes consuming CBD cheap and easy. CBD edibles are a great option for many. They provide steady pain relief and can be used to treat long term conditions such as chronic pain, arthritis, and anxiety. After taking Edible CBD, you have to wait between 30 minutes and up to two hours, to feel the effect. These edibles are digested in the gastrointestinal tract, making them a perfect choice for people with digestive problems. If you want to avoid the side effects of smoking and vaping CBD, swallowing pills, or you just hate the taste of CBD in general, then CBD edibles are perfect for you. However, be sure to check the type of CBD in a product and the strength before selecting the flavor.
