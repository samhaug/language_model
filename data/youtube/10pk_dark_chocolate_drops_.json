{"OR05hmM8P5A": "life City family what is up it is art and Bobby back at the grocery store for a video all about chocolate yes all about chocolate from cocoa powder chocolate chips chocolate snacks chocolate bars chocolate nut butters all that good stuff I want to guide you to find the best quality chocolate at the grocery store so you know exactly what goes into your body before we get into the chocolate and goodness you know the drill like subscribe share but more importantly there's a bell icon right below the video you're gonna want to enable all notifications because the month of January we pretty much have videos going live every single day and you want to get a push notification cuz we're having a great time alright let's start with something kind of basic here here's chocolate chips and cocoa powder do you guys know the difference between cocoa oay and cacao a oh I don't know if people really notice this but this is the traditional cocoa here and it's Oh a and that's cacao AO this stuff is the stuff I use and this is raw unprocessed cocoa this is processed cocoa that's been through some treatment so it's really interesting right and this also this cocoa here has been alkalized right it has some alkalinity to it to lower the acid to it this is completely raw the cool thing about chocolate in general is that it's a fermenting process have you ever seen a rock to cow pod this is big crazy football looking thing but they dry out the beans and they actually ferment them then they turn it into chocolate but I prefer to use the raw cacao because I want that raw benefit without it going through processing but I just want you to see the difference between the one where spelled a o and O a you can get this stuff anywhere sometimes Costco has a monster bag of this brand knobby toss raw cacao it's the best deal ever and I believe it's only a seasonal item and this is actually cacao nibs so when you actually take the cocoa bean and pulverize it this is what you get then you grind these into a chocolate liqueur which is like almost like a liquidy paste then you would add sugar or milk to it but these are really good to make with or just have a snack they're very bitter but very delicious so knowing that will come down to chocolate chips right here it's a really exciting time to buy chocolate chips because the world is sugar free chocolate chips in my pen is next level and when we pick up a normal chocolate chip like this there's nothing wrong with it right these are dark chocolate chips the problem is they're always made with cane sugar and that's the kind of sugar we try to avoid we know cane sugar is not good for us but it also is really bad if you're in gut bacteria we talked about this in the sweetener video cane sugar is the worst sweetener of all if this was sweetened with maple syrup even McGough a nectar would be better something else besides cane sugar I'd be ok with it but I wouldn't be as good as I can be because come down here these sugar free chocolate chips from Lily's our next level delicious you guys so we look at the ingredients and you see they're sweetening it with non-gmo erythritol they use real vanilla and they use stevia extract and the cool thing about this is that it tastes just like the real deal the only one I would maybe avoid is the milk chocolate one because something I find in many other sugar-free chocolate chips they add natural flavors but men if you follow me on the Flav's to the instagram I've been using the dark chocolate sugar free trips to make my keto pancakes on the weekend they're so good you your boo your kids they won't know the difference and it's so much better for you if you're not following me on the flavor City Instagram head over there daily post but daily stories I would make from dinner and it's really really fun so that's super duper exciting to me so I would look for those chocolate chips they're a little more expensive they're $6.99 but without having the sugar that's really important to me now it's winter time we have hot Coco's here the thing with all hot cocoa is just like with the chips they're gonna have sugar so we look at this this is a premium brand here I just knows premium because I'm paying for the glass right but I look at the ingredients first ingredient is cane sugar and they're also sneaking in some natural flavor here so that kind of bugs me but its standard process right you're always gonna see every kind of a hot chocolate like that so I'm actually working on a recipe I'm not done yet for a sugar-free keto hot chocolate that is dairy free and it's unsweetened raw cacao organic coconut sugar a monk fruit sweetener and some cinnamon I'm almost there follow me on Instagram when I'm done I'll post it it's fantastic so these are like the chocolate 101 basics you really want to know let's go down here real quick because I'm gonna go to a part of the video I think you're gonna get really excited about chocolate bars and chocolate snacks let's start here these to me are super exciting because there's schools safe there's Sun buttercups they got rid of peanut butter but sunflower seed and in case your kid or your school has a no nut policy these are really cool the thing is right we look at the ingredients here and we see it's made with dark chocolate so I'm really excited it's not milk chocolate which I consider candy they do use some powdered sugar which I'm kind of bummed out about but how much of the sugar is 12 grams for two servings so to 6 grams per that's just over a teaspoon not terrible the thing is you're very limited when it comes to like nut free treats so this isn't that bad but what excites me even more is sugar free chocolates are taking over the grocery store starting with this you guys these are unbelievable these are from evolved there are butter cups these are the ones that have pretty clean ingredients look at this instead of cane sugar all of a sudden we have coconut sugar Himalayan pink salt not a refined bleached salt but this is cool but if your Kido look at these these are called keto cups and this flavour right here via I'm the first one to break into this how exciting this hazelnut butter art and I had this the other day art how good was this so good look at the ingredients like this did not exist just a couple years ago the drill some artichoke is for fiber cacao butter monk fruit sweetener MCTS this stuff is amazing so you can get them at the store you can get them online very exciting they also make them in these packages which is fantastic also on a reach-in to my cart this is not in stores this is online only but I've been doing some Instagram promotion with this company this is nirvana they're the only company that makes keto sugar-free chocolate truffles each truffle has one net carb here and it's sweetened with a low lows and erythritol and stevia next level ingredients and there's nootropics in there too I'll put a link down below this stuff is fantastic the peanut butter truffles are next level that's online only and then Lily's also has sugar-free dark chocolate just be careful because sometimes when you get to the flavored varieties here like this is salted caramel milk chocolate they sneak in natural flavors and the sure enough there it is right there so you got to be careful and then don't be fooled by brand images on the front cover a lot of people like to think this is a premium company because they make the premium peanut butter the thing is just like their peanut butter they use palm oil so let's see where the ingredients are here the peanut butter they have cane sugar here and let's see right there thank you art palm oil so they use palm oil with their peanut butter so I wouldn't get that I would just get the either the coconut sugar and the keto cups and then there's a documentary on Netflix called a rotten never whole episode about chocolate most of the chocolate from the world comes from Africa or South America but to countries in Africa I think it was Ivory Coast and whatever is right next to it they use a lot of slave labor in the chocolate industry and these guys are slave labor free chocolate just watch the documentary it's crazy but when you buy chocolate you really want to my dark chocolate because I consider milk chocolate to be pretty much candy alright that's it for here let's wrap up the video with chocolate flavored peanut butter spreader like Nutella and chocolate cookies all right for all of my Nutella fans out there the bad news is Nutella is not something I would eat it's made with palm oil and tons of refined sugar and there's really no chocolate nut spreads on the market except the one that is Bobby approved we come down here and this company is next level it's nuts oh and they make a chocolate powerful fuel first of all look at the nuts they're using here in the seeds to chia flaxseed hazelnut and what I love about it if we look at the chocolate see they're using coconut sugar and then the rest of the ingredients are clean and they're using Celtic sea salt one of my favorite unrefined salts this is as close as you can get to hazelnut spread or Nutella there's another one here that looks fancy right it's called no cheer laughs yeah and you're like oh it's organic I'm gonna get it guys Organic doesn't necessarily mean anything look at the ingredients first ingredients cane sugar then we have sunflower oil while sunflower oil is better than palm oil it's still highly processed and highly refined not something I would want I would look for that uh nuts oh I wish they had the big version at Costco like they do for the power fuel that'd be amazing and then all right let's switch around here the wall of chocolate chip cookies is almost impossible because either they use bad oil too many refined sugars there's really only one I can see here and it's this brand so this brand is very high-quality it's from out of Chicago these are chocolate chip cookies and what I love about it is that it's made with a nut and seed blend and they're using coconut sugar so it's paleo and coconut oil so look at the rest of the ingredients all fantastic and the thing is here's my problem you have to read the label cause the double chocolate crunch cookie instead of using coconut oil they're now using palm shortening asterisks responsibly sustainably sourced don't be fooled by that you guys organic palm sugar is like having organic canola oil it's still highly processed in however you're fine so it's honestly one of the only cookie ii find here is this chocolate one that uses good quality ingredients no wheat no grains and a good fat and a good sugar so that's it you guys I make a video about chocolate because there's a lot of options but eating healthy doesn't mean eliminating chocolate it's about eating the right chocolate and the options now our next level this stuff did not exist sometimes five years ago or back in my childhood forget about it it was Hershey's bars and that's it all right what video to make next leave a comment down below these videos are all about you guys like subscribe share the only way our channel keeps growing the way it has is all because of you we got two more of those videos going below us right now but art and I will see you very soon until then we say to you like we always do hashtag keep on cooking mad love and peace guys", "A72oD6Wd14U": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some moonshrook uh chocolates these are from portland oregon uh we found them a tuesday morning and i had not seen this brand that i can recall uh they were 3.99 at tuesday morning i have the milk chocolate hazelnut drops the dark chocolate blueberry drops and the ruby cocoa almond drops so uh these were the only three flavors that i or varieties that i saw i'm sure they make a ton uh but these were the only three that tuesday morning had and so it's i like on the box the box uh well the name of it anyway is moonstruck so i like that right away and then the logo has a moon and then all over the box it has like little gold stars all over it and it says where there is chocolate there is magic so i just i like that these would be good to put a gift basket um three and a half servings nine pieces is 170 calories and it's moonstruck chocolate.com so let me see where i'm going there's tape on the bottom right here oh and they're just loops i don't know why i expected them to be in a bag i expected a bag to be in there but i mean they don't need one of course um okay so milk chocolate hazelnut oh okay no more hazelnuts they actually have a hazelnut in them i wasn't expecting that yeah they're uh it's all it's enough i mean a very little chocolate a little bit of chocolate but not much these are okay if you like hazelnuts i think you'll like those they're very nutty when they said milk chocolate hazelnut i was thinking that it would be the center would be like a nutella or something yeah i wasn't expecting an actual hazelnut like no taro peanut and so i can understand why they charge 3.99 and it's a pretty box anyway but i can understand that because they are using a whole hazelnut in there those are i think they're really really good they're good if you like hazelnuts well i don't think you'd be buying them if you just because they say unless you think like me and you thought you were gonna get nutella uh this is dark chocolate blueberry drops nine pieces is 140 calories so these the hazelnut were 170 these are only 140 uh but i think um these don't have anything in them they're a beautiful color how would you describe that they're shiny luminous they're they're yeah they're they're shimmery shimmery there you go it's luminescent within that glow hmm you can lower that blueberry flavor i got a lot of blueberry flavor [Music] i like the dark chocolate i think it's good quality um it doesn't you can tell it's dark chocolate but it doesn't dry your mouth up did you get a little like seeds or something yeah you there are some little it feels like little seeds in there but i think the blueberry comes through i think it goes really well with the dark chocolate it is what it says it is i think these would be uh beautiful um in an easter basket if you were doing an adult i don't know if a kid would appreciate them but if you were doing an adult easter basket and you wanted to scatter some things out those would be gorgeous they're a beautiful color these are the ruby cocoa almond drops they are uh nine pieces 170. oh okay speaking of easter baskets gorgeous so the purple rose yeah the purple and the rosy color [Applause] you know i've never cared for that flavor that ruby no not really yeah i've never for some reason we've tried it i think we've had it in gosh it seems like we had a kit kat we have had a kitkat um i don't really like that flavor it leaves a a weird aftertaste in your mouth did lent not do one did lent lindor not do something anyway we've had a lot of the rubing and we haven't liked it in anything really it's not something that i would get again but in this i wanted to try because it does have an almond in it and i was hoping that the almond would absorb some of that it has almost like a fruity berry flavor to it and it just completely changes the flavor of the chocolate and i just don't care for it that's one of the better versions of it we've had but but i don't i still don't like it at all i think that's just a personal thing if you like the ruby you would love these because i do think they're very good quality even if you leave them in the boxes and give them to somebody i think they would make a great gift so i'll try if i can to cut these in half each one and get a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] you", "WI6nrvsu5do": "hello guys welcome to the first episode of\u00a0\nCusCyna\u2019s garden this is my first video so i\u00a0\u00a0 hope you enjoy today we are going to be making\u00a0\ndeep dark chocolate drops so let's get started\u00a0\u00a0 first you'll need 1 and 1\u00a0\n4 cups of all-purpose flour\u00a0\u00a0 then you will need 1 4 cup\u00a0\nunsweetened cocoa powder next is one half teaspoon of baking\u00a0\nsoda and one half teaspoon salt one and one half cup semi-sweet chocolate\u00a0\nchips divided you could also use bittersweet\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate chips but i recommend using the\u00a0\nsemi-sweet hot chocolate chip so it's sweeter one stick of butter the butter is right here one half cup granulated sugar 1 4 cup packed brown sugar 1 egg 2 tablespoons milk and 1 TEASPOON vanilla the\u00a0\nfirst thing you will need to do is preheat\u00a0\u00a0 your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit see that okay\u00a0\nthen you will need to line your baking trays with\u00a0\u00a0 parchment paper i used silica um cookie\u00a0\nsheet thingies but they're made of silica\u00a0\u00a0 not parchment paper so next you\u00a0\nwill need to get a medium bowl\u00a0\u00a0 and then combine the flour the cocoa powder the\u00a0\nbaking soda and the salt so where are those um this is this is harder holding\u00a0\nup the camera and stuff and no i do not normally use up\u00a0\nall of the bowls in the kitchen\u00a0\u00a0 and just to make these cookies i normally\u00a0\ndo we normally just like me and my family\u00a0\u00a0 normally just like measure them and then put them\u00a0\nin or yeah i'm hoping that i'm not making a mess\u00a0\u00a0 oh does it look like that

mixing i think that's good now you\u00a0\nwill need to place one half cup\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate chips in a small microwavable\u00a0\nbowl this is a one-fourth cup so i'm\u00a0\u00a0 gonna do it two times if you have\u00a0\na one-half cup great do it one time that's not exact but it's fine now we're going to microwave this until it's\u00a0\nmelted and smooth and we'll see you okay guys\u00a0\u00a0 we're back now that my uh chocolate\u00a0\nis is smooth i am going to mix it uh another beautiful video of me mixing aha now i'm magically holding the butter\u00a0\ntray and a knife um now you will need to beat\u00a0\u00a0 butter granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large\u00a0\nbowl with an electric mixer and first i am going\u00a0\u00a0 to put a butter oh wow that was actually\u00a0\nsmooth kinda um now i need the brown sugar brown sugar soak it up and the granulated sugar\u00a0\nthis is taking a long time oh no i i just made a mess if you can't see it's\u00a0\nfine it's fine anyways you'll need to beat that\u00a0\u00a0 into at medium speed until light and fluffy\u00a0\nand but first i'm gonna fix all this so\u00a0\u00a0 okay guys we fixed up that little mess\u00a0\nso now we're gonna put up the large bowl\u00a0\u00a0 strength 1000 and beat it at a medium\u00a0\nspeed which around here is about like um okay we've mixed it until it's light and\u00a0\nfluffy and now we're gonna scrape the edges scraping edges is hard work going to add the eggs or egg milk and vanilla and milk melted chocolate how do you add this and there's a little person change and now\u00a0\nwe are going to mix it until well blended um anyways we have beat until the well blended\u00a0\nand this is what it should look like now we are going to stir in i mean add the flour\u00a0\nmixture sorry i was looking at the wrong place\u00a0\u00a0 and then beat again until just blended\u00a0\u00a0 okay we have beat it and this is what it should\u00a0\nlook like now we are going to add the remaining\u00a0\u00a0 chocolate chips and then mix it again we have\u00a0\nfinished stirring and it should look like this\u00a0\u00a0 we are going to put the dough onto\u00a0\nthe cookie sheets by table spoonfuls\u00a0\u00a0 and we'll see you there okay guys thank you for\u00a0\njoining us here and now we are going to scoop the\u00a0\u00a0 cookies onto the cookie sheets they

or two and a half dozen\u00a0\neven though the baking book said we would\u00a0\u00a0 get three dozen but that is fine now we are\u00a0\ngoing to bake these for eight to ten minutes\u00a0\u00a0 okay now we are going to put the cookies in the\u00a0\noven and there's another person change like i\u00a0\u00a0 said before we are going to bake it for 8 to 10\u00a0\nminutes so see you after you're done

rate it by\u00a0\ndeliciousness not by looks i'll do another practice ah this is very nice very soft and very chocolatey so anyways see\u00a0\nyou in the next video and goodbye", "SJ13It0ZdnU": "a few years ago chocolate bars got fancy with cacao percentages and origin stories and today chocolate chips are experiencing a very similar Renaissance along with bigger price tags so Jax here to tell us if any of these fancy chips are worth it do you want the good news first always always good news first these are so much better than the last time we did a taste test in 2009 but on average the prices doubled Wow doubled yeah basically these are the same quality as now eating chocolate oh that's good news so start eating alright we did the taste test the exact way that you were doing it right from the package we also baked with the cookies can you guess what we with them chip cookies yeah and we found very similar characteristics the only thing that really changed were there were a couple of brands that were rectangular chunks hmm that we really love straight from the package but caused all kinds of problems in the oven blobs too much not enough chocolate they didn't spread properly basically those big chunks were causing irregularities in the cookies and so although we like the way they tasted they ended up at the bottom of the rankings I didn't bring any of those here cuz you were gonna like them they didn't bake very well I appreciate that so big thing here that you want to be looking for is first of all sugar level mm-hmm so those percentages that are listed on the package the cacao basically the balance of sugar so it says 60% cacao that means it's roughly 40% sugar there may be a little bit of an emulsifier less it in a little bit of vanilla but that's get one maybe two percent at most and the balance is going to be sugar no surprise we thought that the brands with less sugar add more chocolate flavor so that's a good thing second thing that you want to be thinking about is what is that chocolate flavor you know during the processing manufacturers can bring out fruity notes black cherry mmm vanilla sort of you know tropical things they could also bring out espresso smoke whether it's almost like wine maybe is almost like wine and people are very serious about chocolate all kinds of chocolate including the chocolate chip to any impressions of the four samples that are here um this one tastes remarkably familiar to me and I'm wondering if this isn't what I grew up with which is Nestle's semi-sweet chocolate so that's my first impression okay this one was very fruity and you were talking about fruit at the time I was tasting it so maybe I was influenced but it reminded me of some really bitter fruity chocolates that I'm actually not a huge fan of I appreciate it but not the biggest fan so these are delicious I could just sit here and snack on these all day so I'm in love with these these these are pretty good I have to say their size is kind of the classic size they grew up with but they have a better flavor than these so if I were to rate them I think this you are actually by the way it's supposed to rate them I would put these as first these are second these are good there are different style than I like but I appreciate the quality and these would be last okay I should say that the differences in size here these did not impact the cookies as long as it had the round classic teardrop shape it didn't cause any problems with the cookies in terms of distribution of the chocolate so small chip big chip it's really personal preference alright so let's start with my favorite so you chose Nestle's newer more expensive sort of more upscale products this is their bittersweet chip so we probably both grew up on semi-sweet morsels their sugar content is about 57% sugar content here is really closer about 38 purse well much slower much much lower and so you get more chocolate flavor they're also a little bigger which I think has a psychological impact that you think more chocolate it's a bigger chip all right now let's go with these which I kind of recognizes having a fancier flavor they're fancier I'm surprised you didn't like it that was the tasters favorite yeah so that's from Kara deli that is their 60% now they also make a semi sweet which we did not like nearly as much this is actually the exact same formula as our winning bar chocolate Ghirardelli 60% bar chocolate is our favorite we actually called after the tasting they're like yeah they're the exact same thing we just put them in two different molds wow that's new yeah that is new we like this it sounded like you wanted a more classic flavor I did but I do appreciate the flavor profile in here and I know it's very popular so where do you wanna go next this one which I also really enjoy your back in great years old again I am I agree with you in most things I'm gonna disagree with you here things are too sweet they are only 43% cacao I want more chocolate okay you can have your sugar okay I'm taking the chocolate I like that and these which actually I in my head thought were the original what are these they're from a company called guitard yeah who's the runner up again sort of hi cacao this was our favorite of all the different guitar products I'm again we thought just a lot of chocolate flavor and personality alright so there you have it I guess I'm a classic girl but if you want to buy the best chip on the market reach for the Ghirardelli sixty percent premium baking chip at about four dollars of thirty nine cents per bag thanks for watching America's Test Kitchen what do you think we'll leave a comment and let us know which recipes you're excited to make or you can just say hello you can find links to today's recipes and reviews in the video description and don't forget to subscribe to our Channel see you later I'll see you later", "5BftuM29lcc": "today in this video I'm going to show you how to temper chocolate chips I have some chocolate chips here at my Bowl and I also have some chocolate chips which I have laid out in an orderly fashion and I'm going to show you why in one second so I've zoomed in to show you the chocolate chips a little bit closer now the first thing that you notice is that they're all in Nice lines you may have noticed that when you buy chocolate chips at the store and when you hold them in your hand they don't melt very easily and there's a reason for that and the reason being is that all of the molecules are properly placed they're properly formed and this gives structure to of the chocolate just like you see here as soon as you add a little bit of heat to your chocolate chips the molecules go crazy and they do this and now there is total chaos all of the chocolate chips don't know what they're doing all of the molecules inside are very confused and they act like this there is no rule there is nothing that's uniform everything is in total chaos so when you go and try to chill your chocolate you'll notice that it never comes back exactly the way you wanted it to it doesn't get that perfect structure it doesn't get all of those lines all of the chocolate is still in chaos so there's a simple way to fix this and it's by adding in brand new chocolate which still has structure all of these chocolates here the molecules inside don't know what to do and they're looking for somebody to teach them to put them back into order so by introducing new chocolate which has never been melted it actually teaches the molecules and these in these chocolates to actually start going back into line like this and that is a really simple way of thinking about how chocolate is tempered and I'm going to show you that in the next step what I have here is two cups of chocolate chips I am using semi-sweet chocolate chips here today but this works with milk chocolate or dark chocolate as well so I've got one cup here one cup here I'm going to microwave this bowl here the one cup I'm gonna microwave this on defrost until it's melted and then I'll be back okay I am back I am microwaved my chocolate on the defrost mode and it is nice and melted now now this is very very warm at this point I'm going to take this chocolate and pour it into here now remember when I was saying in the opening sequence all of the molecules that are in this chocolate now they don't know what they're doing okay they need some kind of instruction or a teacher and this chocolate here with the with the molecules that are still good these molecules are going to teach the molecules in that chocolate so I'm going to take some of this chocolate I'm gonna get it in there and then I'm going to keep mixing and I want to get most of that chocolate melted so the unmelted chocolate chips are going to teach the melted chocolate what to do and this is going to call and this is what we call tempering so it's going to temper our chocolate so when it cools it's actually going to get firm and it's going to be really nice like it used to be if you melted all of the chocolate together all of this chocolate together you would not be able to temper this chocolate you would have to actually add more chocolate to the mix you can see this is slowly melting so I'm just gonna keep going at this until it's really melted down if I see that this melts completely then I can add a little bit more you want to stop adding chocolate chips to the melted chocolate when you see that the melted chocolate is not absorbing any more of the chocolate so you want to get all this going and just keep stirring and if you find that it is getting a little bit cold you can take the heat of your hand and just get it underneath and keep going at that and it'll eventually all melt in so I'm going to keep doing this and I'll be back in a minute or two okay and at this point most of that chocolate has melted in there I can see that it is really incorporated all of that extra chocolate chips so I can take a few more and just drop them in you don't want to put too many in you just want to get to the point where they really don't melt anymore and from experience I kind of know that's gonna be about it now what happens if you had dumped all those in and hardly any of them melted that means your chocolate wasn't very hot to begin with you can take the whole thing put it into the microwave and only put it on the defrost for about 10 seconds because you don't want to completely melt all of the little pieces that are still in there because if you do then you're gonna have to add even more chocolate in there to temper it so you can see that there is still some in here and those are probably not going to melt a hundred percent however there is enough new chocolate in there the teacher chocolate that are teaching those students that this year is going to be tempered and that looks really really good and that's how easy it is to temper chocolate and this works with any type of chocolate this is how you do it simply at home so I hope you enjoyed this video I hope I explained it well enough so I don't know if I did hopefully I did a good job so that's it for

mint so these were 4.98 each at walmart they are i we found them in two places we found them not only in the baking aisle where they have baking chips but they also have at this time of year and towards on into christmas they have like a seasonal baking section like out in the center like a name now yeah so to where they'll have like jars of minced meat and and uh stuff for tomatoes fruits fruitcake yeah and so you if you don't uh we actually bought eight different flavors this is four we're gonna have a review with four other ones um but if you don't see these in the baking owl then then look look both places because honestly they had seven of the eight in the baking out and then the last one if i hadn't have already been to that section i would have thought i had them all and i didn't there was one on that sec in that section but i want to thank eric for making me aware of these eric sent me pictures i think from walmart letting me know that these were coming out and so i knew to be on the lookout for them so lilies is less sugar sweet like 32 cocoa stevia sweetened no sugar added move over sugar we'll take it from here we decided our chocolate was too good to let added sugar get in the way and so we created a whole line of unbelievable treats uh botanically sweetened with stevia and you know what happened life got sweeter it's less than one gram of sugar gluten-free 26 chips 14 grams is 55 calories so we have tried some of their bars smells good we've tried some of their bars and um they were less sugar so i wanted to try these to see if i could tell you know [Applause] i looked at that texture is good yeah that's very chocolate you think it's dark wouldn't you well yes because it's very little sweetness yes it's just not very much sweet at all no um it's literally like a dark chocolate it's got a bitterness the quality it's good quality yeah good milk remember yes it's creamy these excellent muffins or uh pancakes if you're putting i think they're did go good in a cookie if you're already having a sweet cookie anyways going to that you wouldn't notice the dough yes if you're going to add your own sugar and stuff then yes i think you could definitely use it for you if you're going to use semi-sweet chocolate anyway that kind of reminds me of a cinnamon sweet chocolate right it does it's actually probably a little less sweet but this is the semi-sweet and it's five calories fewer it's uh 50 calories for 30 chips it is a refill bag and they are visually darker i'm trying to get like four i am too they're firmer texture's a little thicker that tastes like a hershey's special dark it's very good if you like those parts very good yes um definitely darker yes i like that very very much if you already are buying um semi-sweet baking chips like the nestle brand now this is seven ounces so i would compare prices or compare what you what you're looking for in a chip but i really like the quality yeah they're good they're still not very sweet but they're no but it but it's semi-sweet you know it is what you know it's what you expect expect uh now this one is dark right yeah so the ones that we're going to be reviewing tomorrow are like extra special flavors so i wanted to get the more boring flavors out of the way first uh this is also 50 calories so these are the more tang flavors um dark chocolate 55 cocoa so what was the first one the milk chocolate it had 32 percent yeah those have a crunch it's crisp um dryer not quite smooth it'll dry your mouth out like a good dark chocolate but you know what it's not it's only 55 percent but i think it's excellent quality that's good it does dry your mouth yes it does whatever bitterness to it i'm thinking um i make these cookies called cabinet cookies i have the video up on my channel and it's basically anything i have up in the cabinet i throw into this basic recipe i'm thinking these i could combine a bunch of them and i'm thinking it would be good with the flavors that we're going to review tomorrow because like i said there's some extra special flavors and those would be good i think i'm thinking they'll be good to combine them with these and i'm hoping that those uh for example one of the ones tomorrow that we're gonna try is uh butterscotch so i'm hoping that like butterscotch will bring some a little bit of a sweeter flavor to the table or white chocolate one of them is white chocolate this one's 55 calories and it's the chocolate mint and this is 32 let's go bigger but i'm thinking combining butterscotch and white chocolate or butter uh white chocolate and one of the things would be good i like the texture i do not like the mouth no the mint is like breath mint not even toothpaste it's a chewing gum there's chewing gum yeah like a minty kind of yes or something like that yeah i i agree with that a man a breath mint or gum yeah i don't really care it tastes like spearmint yeah yeah so for me that's one of those mints that you would just have to try yourself to see if you like that's one you literally have to buy a bag but it does taste just like a gum i don't think we've ever tried in all of our time trying mint cookies mint candy bars i don't think we've ever compared the mint to gum or amount of breath now that tastes like and this does taste like that we've compared it to toothpaste or just a really fresh york peppermint patty mint no this is gum breath mint mint all the way so for me i would not personally want that in my pancakes cookies muffins i would never done at all so i would pass on that one but now the other three are very good the other three are good just know that they're they're all that sweet but they and they're all a little darker so whatever you're expecting to be darker that's the neck it really takes like the next level up right so milk kind of tastes like semi sweet semi sweet kind of tastes like a dark in the dark really tastes dark i agree i agree with that perfectly good assessment but these are good and i feel like we really like these more than we did the chocolate bars that we tried yeah because these these are made to mix in yes so once you mix these in with cookies or brownies or whatever i think you're getting so much sweetness from those it's going to help offset that right when you're just eating a bar and that's all you're eating is a candy bar you're wanting that sweetness right so yeah there's nothing to add to it unless you dip it in them exactly exactly so if if this video interested you uh then tomorrow's should interest you even more because like i said there's some special flavors in there so i hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "Vp0zIQbillE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music]

few years back but she left a great legacy and in the later year she learned how to play the banjo because she grew up in a family of musicians her dad played the banjo and she has tried to pick up some of those teams and so this is one of them again it's called least behind the bridge now this next number we're gonna do this is a piece called mama's got a baby named t9 now this is the dista tune I got from from a recording of Jelly Roll Morton the famous New Orleans a composer and piano player you know trying to tell his story about jazz in which he invented he claimed to have invented quite a number of times mama god baby all right y'all we we gave you a cupholder gave you a couple for nothing to relax in andand now we're gonna ask you to do something this next song we know you're just gonna be awesome at it this is a this is one that we would love for you to sing along now the new boy I've already figured this out but this isn't a this is not a classical concert so you do not

sing along if you catch on to the song and you want to sing along with it that's totally okay with us the only thing we ask is whatever you do just do it with this so the idea that a lot of this music is that was community music it was music that I've been done together so we just we invite you to be a part of to be as active a part of the show as you so feel so in that I in that sort of note we'll

on the snare here and then we're gonna do one called boatman's dance it's all minstrel tune that is it's uh I'm thinking that it came from some some actually boatman singing this tune here because there was a there was a lot of African Americans on the Mississippi working on the boats and stuff so uh but anyway we'll do this one this is called boatman stands thank you folks okay I guess I'll do one right now there's a piece I've known for a while one that's a lot of different genres and I guess it's a little region specific to where we are right now if you just must go sweet she says if you don't you leave me here but you just must go sweet baby don't leave me here don't want you to leave me here you just must go sweet babe leave one two three four five six seven eight nine ten down for

feeding back up here I stopped performing at about eight months pregnant because this was not well let's just say she came mmm we were playing we were gonna try anyway we had a full touring schedule while I was pregnant let's just say I worked a lot while we were pregnant so anyway so she got a lot of banjo basically so when she was leaving littler than she is now and she'd get real fussy in the car and we'd be on the way to the hotel because she's been on the road since you know since as well there was one CD that would just make her call she'd be screaming away like oh my god get me out of the seat and we put the CD on and she go I mean it was the weirdest thing we just I mean we just couldn't help but laugh actually I wish I took video of it because it of course doesn't happen anymore this is from a magic plant I really admire and cousin Emmy in Kentucky this has happened to be the first cut off of that CD it's nice nice quiet calming song Bowling Green put your minds and fallen trees singing much my dear get my view they're rolling for you fix me a bit of my Germans for me yes I'll set him free it's all set in free rolling been around this whole world going through go

got started really as a band he lives in Mebane North Carolina and he used to play with square dancers in his neighborhood with his brother and then later with his cousin and he's the last one you know buddy and his family has picked it up and it's a real shame because it's uh it was it's been a long tradition of him being passed down father son but we were lucky enough to go down and play with him on Thursday nights and learn his tune and spread his music wherever we go so this is one that we learned from him well you know when there's banjos involved there's gonna be tuning involved it's not as hard as the French horn those he said he says now just have it mandra's in my hands got a tune square dance to night I don't think they probably condone square dancing up in here but uh you can square dance in your chairs a single pane or the day when you speed up closer now I know if you you've ever been to a chocolate op show or we've lived this up for anything and we we would not like to take this opportunity this is this is DOM and my name is Rhiannon and we'd like to take this opportunity to officially introduce two other members of the band on stage this is this is a song that Mike

setup heat some water in a bowl below and place another one in it such that the bowl doesn't touch the water below it and once the water starts to boil switch off the flame if waters temperature is too high the chocolate will cease or it will become stiff so you need to melt this chocolate completely so you can see this chocolate has completely melted now we need to let this sit for some time because if you try to pipe it right away the choco chips won't come out nice they will become flat so we'll pipe it after 5 to 7 minutes after the chocolate cools for some time so after that take a piping bag if you do not have a piping bag you can take a stiff plastic or plastic ET le and then you can use that to pipe these choco chips so I'm just keeping this aside so you have laid a butter paper you can also take a thick plastic or something from which you'll be able to lift the choco chips so cut the tip like this I suggest that you do not use any piping tip now start making choco chips like this slowly now why I said do not use any piping tip because the front portion of this piping bag is the one which gets cool easily so after some time if you feel that you are not able to pipe chocolate out of this piping bag you can use your finger to squeeze out the set chocolate out of it but if you use a piping tip you will not be able to do that so don't use piping tip if you want a tip in the choco chips the way we get in market so while you're piping the choco chips and the somewhat set you need you can use your finger or a toothpick to make our tip now I'm going to keep this in refrigerator for some time five minutes so it's been five minutes the choco chips are now set so I'm now going to remove these notice these will come off very easily so you can once you are done removing all these from paper you can store these in an airtight container somewhere in a dry place if the temperature is hot you can keep it in your refrigerator as well so the chocos Epson already get creative with it use it in your recipes enjoy you", "ckW1IKnOYJg": "to bring you something good old time a little bit old time blues little old-time jazz a little country music a little bit this

first heard this I just immediately wanted to do it it's very clever song I wish you'd written it she had but she sang it good and we're gonna do free now this is a well right thank you all right we're gonna do now gonna go back and do a couple of tunes from 1855 and these guys are gonna be will be playing a little bit of the bones for you you know I was sitting outside earlier and I ran into a fellow who happened to be a history teacher now a lot of this music that we're talking about in that big elusive period now think back on your history classes in school see they talked about the Civil War they freed the slaves and then you jump right into World War Two and so and that's the rest of the semester there and so a lot of this music comes from that period where a lot of different developments in the in America and as well as the world happened between like 1865 - OH - Satan about 1920 and that's when we start having recorded documents of that but anyway we're playing a little bit of the bones here these became very popular in the in the blackface minstrel shows and it also became popular in the black community play the bones as well but anyway we'll play a little bit of this one here Briggs corn shucking jig in camptown hornpipe this song is from Scotland and I don't really mean to put an accent on that this is a mouth music and it's in Scots Gaelic which yeah alright don't don't be too hard on me ok so you can tell me what's wrong after the show this is a vocal music to dance to lots of cultures around the world have it and I'm gonna do two pieces first is

"XSsh8jBijKs": "hey there welcome back to tip tops cooking today we are talking chuckling chips my friend you heard me right that's sugar free chocolate chips I'll tell you what ever since the last time I bought sugar free chocolate chips I've said to myself I've got to learn how to make these more cheaply I bought some online and I think for an eight ounce bag I paid about was it nine was it $11 it was too much anyway i'ma show you're gonna make a really cheap today and really really easy let's get started you only need two ingredients to make really great sugar-free chocolate chips at home and this is so easy you're not gonna believe it start off with four ounces of 100% cacao unsweetened chocolate next you need a sweetener of course I'm going to use a teaspoon and a half of powdered stevia you could also use three tablespoons of a rifra tall or Truvia or swerve or something like that I find that they don't dissolve well and you end up with chips that are a little crunchy they're pleasant delicious but they're not smooth like regular old chocolate chips you're also gonna want a pastry bag with a really small tip or a gallon size ziploc bag that you can cut the tip off of you're gonna need a sheet of parchment paper as well when you pipe them out and the first thing that you're gonna do here is chop up your chocolate we're gonna just make it easier for this to melt because of course we have to combine this with the sweetener I'm just cutting it apart with a chef's knife there are a couple of ways you can melt your chocolate you could of course use a microwave and do it in bursts of 15 or 30 seconds and give it a stir now and then I'm going to use a really simple method here this is called the double boiler and you start with and then torso of water in the bottom of a saucepan you don't want it to touch the bottom of the other thing you're going to use here I'm gonna use a glass bowl I'm gonna set that right down in there and in go the chocolate pieces there we go and our sweetener we're gonna keep an eye on this it's gonna gradually melt we're using this method and I've chosen to use a glass bowl because it's the really gentlest way to heat the chocolate after a few minutes you can see my water is simmering and the chocolate is beginning to melt I'm just gonna give to stir once in a while until it does melt all the way as you can see this is now completely melted I've turned the fire off and this is a great time to check for sweetness my finger is impeccably clean of course oh yeah very nice you could also add some more powdered stevia at this point if you like it sweeter now as you might imagine melted liquid chocolate is not something we can pipe out of a pastry bag efficiently that's gonna be a mess and so I've prepared an ice bath here it's just some ice with some water in a bigger bowl and I'm gonna set the other bowl inside of it after heating it up like this we're gonna bring the temperature back down so that our chocolate becomes thick enough to put into our pastry bag and pipe out into chips you could of course put yours in the refrigerator or the freezer for a little while and just check it once in a while my chocolate is finally at the consistency I want and so now it's time to put it in the pastry bag not really a big deal here's our pastry bag with the tip on I'm gonna turn it inside out so we have an opening is near to the tip as possible and then you're just gonna use our spatula to get it in there it's alright if we don't do a terribly neat job event I got somebody else I know that's not a disaster but we have to clean it up you can see I've started to make my chocolate chips this chocolate is a little bit liquid and here's how I do it I give it a squeeze release lift up squeeze release lift up and I'm gonna continue on until I finished with all my chocolate and here's what we end up with after piping them out kind of cool right now I've got some that are different shape so you can see the chop it was probably at different temperatures when I did this so it flowed more easily or less easily in some places but I think these are pretty cool I'm gonna let these harden at room temperature for about another hour or so and then I'm gonna put them in an airtight container and here's what they look like once they've hardened pretty good right I mean I think these look very much like the chocolate chips that you buy in a bag at the grocery store and they taste delicious well alright let's give them a taste I think they look great they're just like oh yeah just like the ones you know in love only no sugar Wow and so cheap this cost me about really good chocolate for four ounces two dollars and 63 cents plus the sweetener which it really was kind of negligible compared back to nine bucks for eight ounces or 11 bucks for nine ounces I can't remember what I paid it it's a lot anyway hope you liked this recipe and I hope that you try it I also hope that you will like

It also has a fraction of a net carbohydrates as some of the premade\nlow  carbohydrate chocolate found in stores.  Let me show you what I mean.  Now I love to\nuse Lilly's chocolate when I bake, but it can be a bit pricey and when we look at\nthe macros, you'll see that 14 grams, which is just about a half an ounce, has a\ntotal of eight total carbohydrates; and when we subtract the fiber and the sugar\nalcohols we end up with three grams of net carbohydrates.  while low, it's more than\nthree and a half times the net carbohydrates in this recipe.  As I said, we'll only need\nthree ingredients... coconut oil, unsweetened cocoa powder, and a liquid\nsugar substitute.  You'll also need a silicon mould for shaping your chocolate. \nAny size and shape mold will work.  I'm using one here to make some chocolate\nchips.  I find using a pourable microwave safe measuring cup to be very helpful\nwhen making this recipe.  Put a half a cup of coconut oil into the measuring cup\nand microwave for about 20 to 40 seconds, or until the oil is melted.  Add a liquid\nsugar substitute equal to 3/4 of a cup of regular sugar.  This amount of\nsweetener will give you a sweetness level on par with semi-sweet chocolate. Add a half a cup of unsweetened cocoa\npowder and mix well to stir.  I like to run the spoon against the sides to help\nbreak up any clumping. This recipe makes just a little less\nthan 5 ounces or a total of 135 grams of chocolate.  Once the cocoa powder has\nfully been incorporated into the coconut oil, test for sweetness and add more if\nyou desire a sweeter chocolate.  Pour the liquid\nchocolate into the mold of your choosing and place in the freezer for 30 minutes\nto help set quicker.  When the chocolate hardens removed from the mold and place\nin a container for storage in the refrigerator.  There you have it folks!  My\nvery simple, three ingredient low carbohydrate homemade chocolate.  A recipe that's easy\nto make and can be used for any recipe that calls for semi-sweet chocolate - or\nsimply enjoy it on its own.  I hope you enjoyed this video.

chocolate chips now this is the recipe I've had a low-carb YUM since the very beginning and when I first made it I did it in method 1 which is to just melt the chocolate and pour it into a baking sheet that's lined with plastic wrap or you can use parchment paper but if you do use plastic wrap I like to add just a little bit of water underneath the pan that just helps it from sticking to the bottom now there's actually silicone chocolate chip molds now they are a little bit difficult to fill so you need to have like a little dropper I actually use a baby medicine like a you know push thing so that makes it much easier to get in the tiny tiny tiny little chocolate chip mold when I make my chocolate chips I'll make some of the chopped in chunks so I'll just pour out a big blob of chocolate onto the pan to harden and then I'll chop it up with a knife and first of all I'll start with the mold so I'll get the regular chocolate chips and then I'll have chocolate chunks that get cut up ok I'm ready to go I've got a chocolate melter and this is the other thing I recommend having it's a chocolate military this one's made by Wilton and it makes melting chocolate so much easier because it gets the right temperature you don't have to worry about things getting too hot on one side in the microwave or dealing with a double boiler because typically when you melt chocolate you want to get it tempered and melted on a double boiler here's how the recipe goes it's super easy you will need to have some food grade cocoa butter that's just to give it the right consistency and every for chocolate and this recipe is great for making any kind of molded chocolate you could use it for dipping chocolates as well like I have a really good low-carb buttercream recipe I like to make those for Easter and shape them into eggs and then I'll dip it into this chocolate just put them on parchment or one of these plastic lined sheets I start with unsweetened baking chocolate so it's just like the baker's chocolate the Ghirardelli anything like that you just want the one that's not sweetened and it does take a while to melt but just put it in a chocolate alter and let it go it helps to to break it up into little pieces and then one ounce food-grade cocoa butter so so far as simple and I like to use LeConte o powder sweetener for mine it's two times as sweet as regular powdered sweetener it's a blend of monk fruit and erythritol I use three tablespoons and it's a real nice sweet no I think it doesn't have that aftertaste that some of the other powdered sweeteners have and of course you can use you know one of the fiber sweeteners like inulin a lot of choc low-carb chocolate has been Elin and yet but I find those fiber ones actually bothers me so I like to use the arithmetic small fruit blend I like to add a little bit of concentrated stevia powder this one's the now brand better stevia and that's just so I don't have to use so much bulk sweetener so that's another reason why I like to use the LeConte Oh powdered sweet you know because it is two times as sweet as other low carb powdered sweeteners and for the stevia all out in an eighth of a teaspoon of that you'll want to have some small rubber spatulas just to stir things around as it melts so the chocolate and the cocoa butter are starting to melt now I'm just gonna give it a little stir it's good to stir the chocolate mixture as its melting a few times just to make sure everything especially the sweeteners get well incorporated okay so my chocolate is just about fully melted now actually I would say that it is fully melted now it didn't take long probably about I don't know 15 minutes or so that looks pretty good I'm gonna put this on warm and I'm gonna take this up to feel a little bit and then I'm going to add a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract let's stir that in sometimes if you add too much of the alcohol extract it can tend to thicken the chocolate and make it change its texture that's why I like to remove it from the heat before adding it in okay so I'm gonna attempt one full mold of the chocolate chip mode so don't worry if you get a little extra over the mold you can just break that up later so we need to have a little patience when you want to make the chocolate chips in the mold okay so it's a couple overfill but I wouldn't worry about that all right I got a tune of the mold done if you want them to look like the chocolate chips you buy commercially I mean you're gonna want to spend the time for the mold otherwise you just take the melted chocolate and you pour it on a sheet pan that's mind this is the easy way and it doesn't really matter you know the shape or whatever but you're gonna have to cut it so they should set at room temperature but it's best to just put them in the fridge that way you can pop them right out and they chill and set much faster so typically in 15 minutes or so sometimes I just wait for half an hour but I'll be back I'm going to go chill these and we'll see how it came out and I'll show you how you cut this one into chunks okay so I just took the chocolates out fridge rater I've got the chips here and the mold and the one piece of chocolate so I'm gonna go ahead and take the chocolate off of the plastic and put it on a cutting board is you're just going to take a knife good to have a really sharp knife they don't have to be uniform or anything like that because it's just gonna be used baking or for snacking or for topping off things like mug cakes I like to put chocolate chips on my mug cakes sometimes the chocolate cake that I make I'll put a little whipped cream and sprinkle chocolate chips on top and it's really good in Bishop you can see those so erythritol does tend to crystallize a little bit or clump up but I don't mind it's a big deal if you want you can use an inland or even in a Leos I haven't used a yellowish yet in this recipe but that's a raw sugar and it's said not to impact ketosis I haven't tested it myself personally with a blood meter but from others they say that it doesn't take a medic Atossa okay so let's go ahead in check out now these ones are actually my favorite they are a little more work but I like doing the chocolate chip molds and then you just pop them out like that there you go now if you can see that but they're just little chocolate baking chips and these ones do actually look a lot better then the chocolate chunks so homemade chocolate chips low-carb keto friendly no sugar added and you're just going to want to keep them in the fridge for snacking and it's they're delicious and like I said you can make them in chocolate bars too as well because mmm if you're a chocolate fan like me you're going to want to have these around I hope you guys give it a try and I hope you these and you use it for all your baking that's it for now see you guys later until next time bye bye [Music]", "Vw7Tc2L2mbQ": "[Music] hello much more fat adaptive family and welcome back to is it worth it the series where I get kita friendly products or gadgets and I review them from the point of view of someone that has been in ketosis for over five years I asked you guys in a poll via my YouTube community tab what you wanted me to review it was a close battle but Lily's semi-sweet chocolate baking chips triumph now unfortunately for this video to be out on time I can't get a hold of the semi-sweet ones in the UK at the moment with everything that's going on so instead I've opted for the dark chocolate version I'm absolutely happy to review the semi-sweet ones in the future but I think it will be quite a similar review to this one because it's the same product with just slightly varying ingredients so Lily's sweet is an American company that specializes in low sugar chocolate whilst they do other products that are keto friendly we are specifically looking at these chips because these are very very popular among American keto bloggers and they are rated anywhere from four point one to four point seven 1/2 five stars and this is from thousands of reviews across multiple different platforms so in terms of ingredients these baking chips includes unsweetened cocoa inulin of raithra toll soy lecithin stevia extract and vanilla extract that's it and nutrition per serving which is about 30 grams you're looking at 60 calories 4.5 grams of fat one gram of protein and eight total carbs but three grams are from a rifra toe and four grams are from dietary fiber so net carbs per 30 gram serving is one gram so to really test these chips I wanted to try them in three different situations and those situations were on their own baked into something sweet and on their own but with other ingredients starting with them on their own they are softer than dark chocolate it's Alfie's but they still hold themselves well they don't snap as you bite into them but they don't just immediately melt in your mouth however taste wise they are pleasant they're not obviously sweet unless you have multiple at once and they have a very American chocolate taste it's kind of really hard to explain this but I find that as a Brit American chocolate tastes different no matter what the ingredients are it's almost like it's more syrupy tasting like a little bit more artificial so then I baked them into my no flour peanut butter cookies the texture of the chips in the cookies was really interesting they like started to melt and then just stopped so that when they came out the oven they were set into the cookies but they were still like a chocolate chip shape whereas if you just bake dark chocolate directly into cookies I find it pulls and I'll be honest I couldn't massively taste them I could feel the texture but I wasn't getting a strong chocolate taste like I do when I just chopped off chocolate into these cookies so for the chips that were raw mixed with other ingredients I decided to go with a keto trail mix I kind of made up on the spot so I used walnuts salted peanuts pecans pumpkin seeds salted peanuts shredded coconut cranberries and of course the chocolate chips this was absolutely awesome it was exactly what I was hoping it would be and what I want from a trail mix you know it had saltiness it had bitterness it was sweet and I wasn't expecting the sweet flavor to actually be enough from the chips because they're not massively sweet but no it was absolutely perfect especially with the bitterness from the cranberries oh I also put them on top of a piping hot mud cake and oh my gosh they are amazing melted so let's get straight in with the pros and the cons starting with the pros like I said in the nutrition these are incredibly low carb at one gram of net carbs per 30 gram serving which means they are appropriate for any sort of kind of keto whether that's strictly to dirty keto lazy keto and so on and they use such a minimal amount of ingredients which is really good I'm really unexpected for a commercial food and the ingredients themselves are she find for most folk the cocoa is unsweetened the sweeteners are great and I'll talk about them in depth in a minute vanilla extract is fine the soy lecithin is just an emulsifier and with these ingredients being used it means that these chips are gluten free their GMO free their vegetarian and vegan friendly but they're also absolutely fine for lactose intolerant folk like myself they are Fairtrade certified meaning that this company is paying the product producers in developing countries fair pay and the sweeteners the sweeteners being used are in Ulan a rifra tall and stevia extract inulin is a fiber usually from chicory root and it has a glycemic index of one I refer to as a poly old also known as a sugar alcohol it has a glycemic index of between 1 and 3 I usually say wanted to a stevia extract is an extract from the natural stevia plant with a glycemic index of zero so with such low glycemic indexes these sweeteners won't raise your blood Sugar's at all this is a perfect chocolate chip for diabetics and all keto folk the next Pro is the variety of Lily's chocolate chips right so they do milk ones semi-sweet and ones and dark chocolate ones all of them are low sugar and they are keto friendly I just think it's important to know that there's a type of chakra for all varying tastebuds within the keto community these chips have a pleasant taste they don't taste too artificial they don't taste like the very dark chocolate but they don't taste like a very milky chocolate I honestly think that my carb eating sweet tooth 9 year old niece would enjoy these and lastly in the pros is the convenience you can absolutely make your own chocolate chips at home but that's a bit of a hassle you can also just chopped up chocolate and put it into whatever recipe you are using however sometimes we just like the convenience of just opening a bag pouring them weighing done and that's exactly what you get with these and now we move on to the pro / cons and the cons are either or and it heavily depends on who you are there is a potential of that minty aftertaste that people complain about with keto food this is just because of polyols being used the deeper you are in taquito the less prevalent this minty taste will be I don't get a minty taste at all but a fertile is my main sweetener of choice today availability is both a pro and a con if you live in America it is absolutely a pro you can buy them directly from Lily's website same applies if you're Canadian you can also get them on Amazon USA and online USA health stores elsewhere in the world is a little bit tricky over here I believe there is only one store that is online that sells them they are listed on Amazon but they're never in stock and you can get them for a little bit more money on eBay but it's actually the same online store that sells them on eBay and I'll be honest with you I have no idea for the rest of the world if you have a fructose intolerance you shouldn't be having these because inulin which comes usually from chicory root fiber is basically a chain of fructose polymers of course the same applies if you have a soy intolerance because these use soy lecithin lastly in the Pro / cons is the potential to be gassy or have diarrhea this is very very common with foods that use polyols also known as sugar alcohols so don't eat a lot of them in one seeing I had about 4 tablespoons over a couple of hours whilst I was trying these chips and jesus wept I sounded like a brass band for about 12 hours so now we'll move on to the comments they are ever so slightly higher carb than the semi-sweet baking chips this is a really weak con but it's kind of surprising for me that the darker chocolate variation has slightly more carbs than the semi-sweet variation but I say this is a very weak con because it's literally less than a gram more and the biggest con is the price whether you buy these chips from their country of origin or outside of it it is pricey in the USA a 9 ounce bag is about $6 over here in the UK it's a minimum of 10 pounds up to 13 pounds for the same nine ounce bag or 225 grams that is a hell of a lot of money when I can just buy the same amount of dark chocolate in bars and chopped it up for 3 pounds so Lily's dark chocolate baking chips are they worth it it is no coincidence that these have such high ratings they taste really good they're really easy to use honestly they have minimal folks to them and to be absolutely usable by all different variations of ketosis just bear in mind the price they're great but it's cheaper to just buy dark chocolate and chop it up but with that being said that is all for this video leave a like if you find it interesting insightful or

color and passion and personality and all kinds of of these great elements that are fused into this magnificent diamond for lack of a better word call it folk roots music americana this stage is a celebration of the music and the artists who perform it you don't have to be famous to be on wood songs you just have to be good sometimes you're all those things and our friends and these folks that are first on our stage today have made a name for themselves in the world of a bluegrass all over the globe audiences for flocking out to see them that they're taking their music to a very adventurous level and not only is it the tradition of bill monroe and and jd crow and earl scruggs but they're also performing their music with symphony orchestras and classical elements it's a it's a great example of a band that takes roots music and pushes it to limits beyond what most folks can expect they've got a great cd that's called up 18 north this is the title song please welcome our friends from switzerland the kruger brothers to the woods songs old time [Music] [Music] radiology [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Applause] jen's krueger on the banjo uva kruger on guitar joel landsberg on the base the krueger brothers it's a uh uve this is a really nice cd up 18 north and you just played the title cut yes and and the your cds are are very nice representations of what people are hearing on stage right now this is not a whole lot of surprises not like you over produce your records or anything you know we just sit around the microphone and just record pretty much the way we perform and that's a it's a long tedious process because we go back and back again until we get it right you know but a lot of takes but then also when we when we get to perform the songs again after we recorded them they're pretty much practiced you know so that's a that's a good thing now you you and your brother jens are from switzerland yeah we grew up in switzerland and and music was introduced to you from your father at a young age yeah my father started in the united states in the back in the 50s and brought back some records you know we grew up with well we had mozart and beethoven all that stuff at home at the same time jim reeves and chet atkins you know and so we fell in love with country music really early and in our family everybody played the guitar so i started out playing the guitar when i was like seven and yes love the banjo and um my mom bought him a badger when he was like seven and then we started playing so it was very young and it was in your family and your family encouraged you to play keep playing something on your guitar do do a solo piece i mean are you tuned up and ready for something or i don't i don't really perform solo pieces you know to play with the trio but let me hear just the sound of your guitar [Music] do [Applause] [Music] you use a very hard pick on your guitar hard pick and hard strings and a big guitar yeah right right well let's everybody say hi to uh yance on the banjo playing a magnificent banjo we're going to talk about this in the second half hour but but very briefly you you uh write a lot of the instrumental compositions for the krueger brothers and and you also have this uh really burning desire to perform symphony orchestras as a bluegrass ensemble yeah i thought um well the the banjo and the guitar and the page they sound beautiful together but sometimes you know you can hear all these you know that you're a banjo player not like you don't put me in the same room as you but we you know while we perform you know we call it almost chamber music it's living room music when we you know sit at home and play folk songs you could sometimes hear a lot more behind that and than just the instrument that you hear in the room and uh an orchestra does a good job you know yeah well they certainly fill the holes don't they yes and i was always interested in writing scores and so this is uh it's been a lot of fun to write all the parts for the french isn't that a lot of work though i mean yes it's it's it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun you know it's it's it's challenging but it's a lot of fun and what's nice is that that you as an ensemble the krueger brothers do go out performing with symphony orchestras the the kind of music that people are hearing now but with a full symphony behind you yes we have a we have a a project with the bangor symphony orchestra and and the program that we written this the name of it is music from the spring and it's a full evening program with the symphony well it's something that i think your your fans and fans of bluegrass music can certainly uh push their their musical envelope with you as you stretch into these different boundaries like the symphonies and stuff going back to your cd up 18 north there's a great song on there called carolina in the fall you can play it for us caroline in the fall it's the kruger brothers on the woods songs old time radio [Applause] all the hours i've been to and all the things that i have seen since i left my home to wonder when i was just 15. oh the traveling was easy still sometimes the road got rough and by the time that i turned 35 i thought i'd seen enough but for me to settle down a while was not what god had planned so one more time i left my whole suitcase in my hand and the journey took me far and wide across the deep blue sea and now i know since i've been there where i was meant to be and i've seen sunsets on the ocean i've seen the desert bloom to the endless highways [Music] carolina [Music] now for 30 years i sang the songs the doctor taught to me and the things that he would sing about i never dreamed i'd see and then folks i've opened up the door for the first time in my life i'm not a stranger anymore and i've seen sunsets on the ocean i've seen the desert bloom drove the endless highways [Music] yet the picture in my mind i see i think about it all is the color of the leaves in carolina [Music] i think about it all is the color of the leaves in carolina [Music] [Applause] song is caroline in the fall the cd up 18 north the krueger brothers are on our broadcast and certainly the krueger brothers baila fleck and the fleck tones other artists like them that are are representing the adventurous and progressive side of bluegrass and roots music you go backwards to the days of earl scruggs bill monroe and others that represent what we consider the maybe the traditional side of bluegrass and roots music but predating that by by many uh scores of years uh it began on ships coming from the western side of africa and people would be bringing these little gourd instruments with a stick uh plugged into the into the gourd and they would come to america and they would uh play these instruments and it was part of a culture that was uh very much with the black americans the african-americans and the slaves at the time not that we're going to a big discussion of that particular part of american history but the music really comes from there and one of the very few bands that are representing this music and carrying on the tradition that is really many generations old are the next artists on our stage they come from north carolina they've got a great cdl called donna donna got a ramblin mind here's a song called georgie buck to introduce themselves please welcome to the stage carolina chocolate drops to the woods songs old time [Applause] radio [Music] do [Music] in my brain [Music] the last place [Music] what he said [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] we say [Music] not [Music] so [Music] it's the carolina chocolate drops justin robinson on the fiddle rihanna gibbons on the claw hammer banjo dom fleming's playing the uh playing the the jug actually you were actually on stage for the radio audience you actually got an old clay jug it's got a strap on it and you can you could talk to me about it yeah yeah i played the jug um i was brought up in phoenix arizona and i just happened to see a movie called um it's out actually it's called festival and it's a compilation of the 1963-1966 newport folk festival and um in the first segment they have the jim question jug band and so i watched that a lot of times because in the back you got fritz richard playing the jug and i just i'd always wondered about it because you know you just wondered how do you get all that sound out of a jug you know you hear all the recordings and so i just took it to folk festivals with me out there in arizona and just learned and then when i got together with these guys i just started playing with them well let's say hi to rhiannon and playing the uh clawhammer banjo welcome to the show hello you you during my introduction of you as a band you held up one of the gourd um instruments that the the banjar that thomas jefferson had seen the uh slaves playing that the the banjo was originally an instrument of color yes well this is actually called nakanting it's from the gambia west africa and this is just one of the many african instruments that eventually melded into the banjo there's there's some from mali and senegal and there's there's a whole group of them but this is just one and this is actually played clawhammer style they call it utech style so when i went to learn over there i already knew the claw hammer so all i had to do was learn everything else which was considerable i'm just i've got this much but you know to go back you're doing fine where does your interest in a young woman playing the banjo you know the old-time string music and stuff i mean just just in general i mean where does your interest in this music come from well i mean i was i was very i started becoming very interested in it just through the dance i went to a lot of contras and squares and then i started wanting to know more about the musicians a lot of the old-time bands that were playing in north carolina um and then i discovered the african roots of the banjo and that's when i really really got interested in wanting to because i was like because i always kind of felt furtive about it like oh i'm not supposed to be interested in this music you know but then when i learned the history i was like oh oh it's part of my you know it's all in my family you know so that's that's one of the reasons now now you're alluding to something that that i always found kind of interesting almost dismayed about there are not a lot of of young african-american people that are interested in the instruments of their culture the the instruments that were originally about that people well we're hoping that's changing because for a long time there wasn't a lot of youth in the old time community as a general rule but now there's a lot of kids of the folk revivalists you know their kids are growing up and then we're we're discovering that uh kids of color coming up to us it's not that they don't want to play the instruments it's just they didn't think it was part of their history so that they see us playing it and they're like oh oh okay you know so it's really cool to bring color some color back into old times since old time came out of color and white you know together sure absolutely [Applause] and what's nice is that you're not only wonderful musicians and a great stage act but this is like an educational force on tour i mean i'm sure that you're you're surprising a lot of people young and old of different races and colors i mean who cares about that it's just good music and it's fun to listen to so it must be a lot of fun to play that's one of the very interesting things is that we all individually got into our musics by ourselves and we all at the

[Applause] carolina chocolate drops dom fleming's on that very adventurous vocal let's say hi to justin robinson sitting there with his fiddle in his lap justin i mean you know you folks are going to think old-timey music they're automatically going to think of the appalachian mountains which is not necessarily the the true root core beginnings of of this music in north america i mean why don't you tell me a little bit about the history if you want well what we play is a piedmont style of uh old time music and the piedmont style is right it backs right the piedmont actually backs up right to the to the mountains it literally means the foot of the mountains so it's where the economic center of north carolina virginia and south carolina all are and this area was a very heavy um demographically it was more black than it was and then it was in a lot of other places in north carolina so in this tradition the banjo is the lead instrument so what the fiddle is doing is often accompanying the banjo which is a which is pretty different than a lot of other traditions especially in appalachia and there's there's a lot of uh fiddle players out there that uh that brought that tradition forward joe thompson is a good example and there's there's so many other players out there rhiannon i mean there's there's ways people listening to this broadcast and hearing the carolina chocolate drops and they're interested in that that community of players we're talking black or white i mean mike seeger is part of this this great community of true old-time traditional players and and how there's festivals like the black banjo festival tell me about that that festival well that that festival happened in boone north carolina in 2005 and that's as funny that you should mention that because that was a that was a huge festival bringing together a lot of the people who have been talking about the roots of the banjo being african and also two african players um sheikh hamad al-jabatai and then mike seeger and bella fleck was hanging out and it was it was really joe thompson was there al james hinton it was an incredible um sort of meeting together these people have been want who had been talking about this for years and then also there were the scholars and academics but then they're also the some of the players like black banjo players who'd been like alone in their states going i'm the only one you know the ebony of ebony hillbillies right in new york and so it brought us all together and that's actually where we all met each other and we wouldn't be a band now if it wasn't for the black banjo gatherings right there is a growing um re-recognition i realize that's not a true word but i'm going to use that word it's it's they're they're recognizing it all over again for the for the true value that it is and it's great that that young bands like the carolina chocolate drops are taking this passionate interest in a very important part of our musical culture now we're going to go back into your music the the new cd is called donut got a ramble in mind did i say that right tell me about donor well this is the tune that we learned from our mentor like you mentioned joe thompson before when we first started going down there and learning from we thought that donna uh was a woman uh it turned out the donut was his dog um so we found out fairly quickly that he used to ask don't yeah yeah pays to ask and not to assume something but that's the title of our cd we play that that song's actually on there and this next one that we'll play is on there also the song is sour wood mountain let's get into it the carolina chocolate drops on the wood songs old time radio rounds so [Music] is [Music] my oh [Music] go crazy [Music] [Music] roosters [Music] so

creams just fell off then step on behind and Oh oh boy yeah we'll just we'll just clean it up so I guess at the end of the video because I got to go clean [Music]", "qfPpWkKbwsg": "[Music] the way that we got together is a group Justin went to the black banjo gallon to meet up with Joe and so he started going down and see Joe and then did he and rien met and so then Breanna and start playing banjo with Justin down at Joe's and then I started joining the two of them we were going to see Joe and so then the three of us were you well Joe has been playing this type of music since he was a small boy and he learned from his dad and his uncle his cousin everybody they all played he's one of the last if not the last of that tradition of string band players who grew up now learning from my father and that's why he's over that chain but I guess by all intents and purposes Joe's music should have been gone a generation ago I shoulda sold I was inspiring [Music] he's passed on his music to a lot of different people a lot of people have gone down and and studied with him and played with him I think what excites him about us is that first of all we're a group going down so it's kind of like the group living in you know he is excited that we're but because you know for a long time he thought that was it think about knowledge is that it's not meant to be sort of hoarded up and you know kept down to his office sort of meant to be disseminated [Music] the idea of African history and african-american history being a part of the curriculum year around not just on Maurice King day but actually just part of the curriculum and and to be something that's important for everybody to learn not just like listen but everybody to learn because it is part of world history that's part of American history that and the fact that music is such an easy way to get into history such an easy way to get into culture it's such an easy way to say this is what happened 50 years ago here's a song about [Applause] one of our goals is to get people to be like it's okay is it's American music but even more so the fact that it was created by all the cultures that were involved and I just want we just want to let the music do what it's going to do because that's how we got together and I think anything else is just going to portray you know what what we're about would love to be a little on the radar of the black community a little bit more just because as a whole yeah and not just us but this whole idea of of American music and where it's come from and just you know the roots of you",

Chocolate Drops [Applause]", "6jB_UypLUfA": "- There is nothing\nquite like chocolate. It's delicious,\nsoothing, sensuous, and it's had a hold on us\nfor thousands of years. Mm chocolate. I'm gonna like this episode. I'm Sheril Kirshenbaum\nand on this episode of Serving Up Science\nwe'll finally figure out what all of those percentages\non dark chocolate really mean. We'll also find out what really high percentage\nchocolate taste like. Okay, let's start with\none of my favorite parts that's easy to overlook. Chocolate, it literally\ngrows on trees which means there is such a\nthing as a chocolate forest. The wild cacao plant originated\nin what's now Ecuador before being domesticated\nat least 4,000 years ago and it all began\nwith dark chocolate. (harp music) And it comes from\nthese, cocoa pods. The cocoa fruit ranges\ntremendously in color from dark purple to\norange to pale green. The pulp can have a\nwide range of tastes from nutty to fruity\nand its seeds are bitter without the sweet chocolate\nnotes you might expect. All in all, picking\nup a cocoa pod could be a\ndisappointing experience for anyone envisioning Willy\nWonka's chocolate room. To bring out the flavor\nwe recognize as chocolate it takes a lot of time as\nwell as drying and roasting. And while it may not be obvious, chocolate is a fermented food. Now we don't know everything about the history\nof making chocolate because the archeological\nevidence is limited. But there are vessels\ndating back to 1500 BC that still have traces\nof chocolate inside from the Almac people\nwho lived in what is now Central America and\nSouthern Mexico. Rumor has it that\nchocolate beverages were made for ceremonial\nand medicinal purposes. Then in the late 1500s the\nSpanish got in on the game and brought chocolate\nback to Europe. They added some sugar\ncane, some honey, and voila it was sweeter. But it was only reserved\nfor the aristocracy. It wasn't until the\n1820s that Europeans finally figured out\nhow to press chocolate into a hard pallet leading to the first\nbar-like consistency. During the 20th century, mass distribution\ngreatly increased the popularity of\nmilk chocolate. And in late 20th century, dark chocolate reappeared\nand grew in popularity due to its health benefits. So let's find out more about, see I don't want to say\nhealth benefits twice. (beep) It's good for your body. - [Woman Producer] That's good. - Oh I wasn't really gonna say-- - [Man Producer] Do it like\nthat with a Brooklyn accent. (laughter) - Folks where I live don't\nactually talk like that but I can do it pretty well. And I can definitely\ndo Long Island. (laughter) We should do some serious Long\nIsland, have my cousins on. (beep) And in the late 20th century, dark chocolate reappeared\nand grew in popularity due to its health purpose. Joining me in the kitchen\ntoday is Barbara Wilson owner of Mindo Chocolate. (camera shutter noise) So while I pepper\nBarbara with questions, we'll be eating progressively\ndarker pieces of chocolate. Think of it like\nthe serious hot ones but for a bitter sweet things\ninstead of spicy wings. Anyway, the first\nthing I want to ask you is how do we define\ndark chocolate and what are the different\npercentages actually mean? - Well dark chocolate is\nanything over about 50% cocoa and there is no legal\ndefinition of dark chocolate. And the percentages mean\nthe percentage of cocoa in the chocolate so\nif it's 50% chocolate then the rest is milk or sugar or whatever other ingredients\nthe chocolate maker puts in the chocolate. What we have here\nis 67% chocolate if you'd like to try some. - Yeah let's do\nour low percentage which I should point\nout is still higher than a lot of the candy\nbars we find here. That's a good one. What do we have next? - Oh we have a 70% but this\none's our rustic chocolate so the texture is going\nto be very different. - Looks different. - It's not refined as much as\nthe other chocolate you tasted so it has crystals in it. - Ooh, I like the rustic. - This one is 77%, we're\nback to smoother chocolate that's been stone ground\nfor a longer time. - All right so let's see, I'm wondering if this is\ngonna be a little bit bitter if I'll still like it. Yup, I still like this one. Let's taste our\ndarkest chocolate. - We have 100% chocolate here. - Oh so when we're going dark we're going as dark as you can. And what is dark\nchocolate known for? - As far as flavor it\nwould be fruity notes. - It is not what I expected, I mean it wasn't that bad\nbordering on pretty good. It's much smoother, not nearly as bitter as\nI thought it might be. And this is where\nhow dark chocolate is\nmade really matters. in the US a candy bar only\nlegally needs to be 10% cocoa to be called chocolate and that's clearly just\nnot going to cut it in terms of health benefits. If you're interested in\nchocolates health perks, it needs to be at least\n70% or 80% dark chocolate. And since we're going darker it's worth pointing out\nthat this is good for us. For a long time we've known that the theobromine\nin chocolate can act as a stimulant\nbut more recently scientists have spent\na lot of time studying the science of chocolate and the results are a\nreason to be optimistic. So when people crave\nreally dark chocolate what are the notes or flavors\nthat they're really going for? - There's magnesium in chocolate and I think a lot of\npeople crave magnesium. - Have I mentioned this is\nmy favorite episode so far? Now that we've had our\nfair share of chocolate, let's turn to our panel\nof chocolate enthusiasts to see what wins them over. First sample, this is 67% cacao and you're all gonna\ntake a little taste and tell us what you think. - It tastes really dark. - [Sheril] Is it\nlike Halloween candy? - No. I like Halloween candy better. - I think my taste buds\nare messing with me it tastes like milk\nchocolate (laughs). - [Sheril] You look\nlike you love it! Do you love it? Our next dark chocolate is 77%. - It's worse than the 67%. - I don't like\nit, okay I'm sorry but it like it's sour. - Um, it's better than the 67%. (gasping) - [Sheril] Taste 100% cocoa. - Mm.\n- [Sheril] Really? - I can't. - [Sheril] Two very\ndifferent reactions. How about you Violet,\ndid you like it? - Mm-hm. - [Sheril] Yeah? - It's better than both. - [Sheril] Really? - That was painful to eat. - It's not sweet and I\ndon't like very sweet stuff. - And the winner\non this panel is-- - [Atlas And Violet]\n100% dark chocolate! - Except for me! (upbeat music)", "GR1G2wnDfbg": "howdy folks welcome to the hillbilly kitchen today I have the world's easiest nut cluster recipe for you we're going to do peanut clusters and cashew clusters okay all you need is half cup of milk chocolate tips and we're going to dump them in a bowl a half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and you need a tablespoon of either shortening or coconut oil I like the coconut oil because I think it tastes better in the recipe and it's also a little healthier but you can use regular shortening you don't want to use butter in this because it's not going to do the same thing what the the oil does is that it gives your chocolate a really nice Sheen and butter won't do that now we're going to take this over to the microwave and we're going to melt it 30 seconds at a time stirring it in between each 30 seconds okay just give it a little stir and back in the microwave and again a little stir you can see after just 60 seconds it's starting to melt okay just give it another quick stir scrape the sides of your bowl good okay now I'm going to pour this over my nuts I'm just going to kind of divide it I have a half a cup of cashews and a half cup of peanuts try to get it as even as possible here I have people comment all the time on the channel and they say oh I wish I can cook this is a recipe literally anybody can make so start with stuff like this and then work your way up to the candies where you have to get everything the right temperature and you're just going to stir the nuts up so they all get coated good with the chocolate okay I've got some little candy cups over here in my mini muffin pan and you can get these in different designs they have them for all the holidays and I got some Valentine's ones so I'm going to put some of my nut clusters in these little cups instead of just putting them out in piles but you just want about a spoon and make sure you get some of that chocolate in there with them too you don't have to have the little cup so you can just spoon out spoonfuls onto some wax paper and let it cool and then you peel it off your wax paper and put it in an airtight container and I would probably store these in the fridge you don't necessarily have to because there's not really anything that's going to spoil in them at room temperature but they'll last a little longer if you put them in the fridge and you can see you don't have to be neat with this because I certainly am NOT being neat and if you don't have the baking cups so you just put a spoonful out on some wax paper and let it cool and you have nut clusters and once these cool you'll be able to take the the little paper cups out of the muffin tin and they will peel off the nut clusters pretty easy but you can see how shiny this chocolate is and that's because we put that tablespoon full of um coconut oil in there and I said you could smell the coconut oil when I was heating and it smelled really good but the coconut oil will not make your chocolate taste like coconut these are really good to make and share or just have around the house to satisfy those chocolate cravings and like I said you don't need the little paper cups I'm doing them because I'm doing something kind of special for Valentine's Day usually nut clusters are just out on wax paper like these right here are and you can make them any size you want to you can make great big nut clusters but that's all there is to it and you put different kind of nuts in these if you want if you're not a fan of peanuts or cashews try them with something different super easy recipe give it a try this Valentine's Day or just any time you got a chocolate craving thanks for joining us again in the hillbilly kitchen don't forget to click like and subscribe before you leave

instruments that there are in the world they've been found in the ruins of Mesopotamia they've been seen in 15 century Christian literature they found them in ancient Egypt and they were not as clappers I think until we found in parts of India Asia Ireland and that's how they actually came to America in America the way that the bones became popular was in the mid-1800s the blackface minstrel show featured the banjo the fiddle the bones and the tambourine and so the bones were very prominent instrument first actually with the with the dancers that started off in blackface in the 1830s that became the first international phenomenon before the banjo came along so they they got into dancers and bones players and then slowly and steadily they finally filled the band down and because you know the a lot of blacks are spending a lot of time an Irish it was even part of becoming part of African American music before Mitchell see when they calm street-corner orchestras or that's a terrific time stumble on this pair that I have here it was actually made of ebony wood like a piano and this is what a lot of Mitchell's prefer to use this sort of word which you can hear that's sort of more like a hollow so it has a little bit of a a little more of a hollow sound a little more more of a base year sound in the wood and and so it's just all the matter about what materials you use for the bones that kind of your own preference because the bones themselves are real impersonal instrument each bones player places a little bit differently we both learned how to play from this guy named Michael Bay Tom yeah who I met it typical come grab a hill in Maryland after that girl stole my money at the taper well sorry does 20 was my pockets and heat up anyway what over the bridge but he's sort of a player who is very minimal I started reading about a dimensional show I start seeing these pictures of these guys with their arms hanging way out wide so I started trying to discipline if you can reach you know with them you know all the different space that you can move in your body and so there's a lot of just you know interesting experimentation that goes on that with the bones since they we reacted every single one of your movement exactly since Michael Bay talked like the way he taught if you haven't talked to you about a title people are saying images and now your bones player figure it out and each one of the people who learn from him and the one week I was hanging out with him now click it weekly differently you know as it major of the instrument and one thing I don't recommend and his mentor mr. bones show told them to just play play with any type of music usually the bones are associated with traditional music Irish music or American folk music but generally you can play the boat with anything you could just have the radio and play along with whatever song you feel like playing and so that was something that Michaels had mentioned to me so that was that was another way to really expand the idea of where to take the bones and how to use them and when you're learning how to play the bones you need to play with the radio a lot because people don't when you're coming up behind them on a jam and during the show I got you kind of a lot of jams first of all because every I can tell you this true statement between the two of us the bones are very loud yes they're to help a loop about your instrument reading since we were playing a couple of special minstrel tunes this is a replica banjo from the minstrel era this was made by Jim Hartle based on a rubbing of a Joel Sweeney banjo who was one of the first so we say Caucasian Americans to pick up the banjo he learned from the black players of course because there were no other kinds of players were banjos when he started learning the banjo banjo is known as purely an african-american instrument it's hard to say whether he was the first but he was definitely the first one that we know of and would have been one of the first to really take the banjo out for a white audience and in addition to him there was a men and a lot of other people dynamics one who wrote Dixie that's another whole nother story but the banjo is very different from the modern banjo it's got a gun skinhead and wooden trim here and a fretless neck and see it's a much more sort beefy instrument down here in particular but it's got a much lower sound these would have been played with gut strings the strings that I have a canal that's their synthetic gun there's much more of a sort of a bounce with this kind of banjo is much more rhythmic kind of thing there's there's there's things in minstrel playing that you it's really hard to do on a modern mandro modern wire string banjo [Music] that kind of thing is just real it's a really organic instrument and the the really important thing about this music is that a lot of those early minstrel banjo tunes were actually collected from black players so it's really some of the earliest method musicology we have I mean it's kind of in a weird it's kind of in a weird place because those tunes were then used in blackface minstrelsy which was clearly white people in blackface sort of portraying african-americans but the thing the important thing about Mitchell C is that a it went on for a long period of time it was the form of American entertainment that that it went on for a long time we were talking you know eight years and also there were different kinds of measure see the earlier mr. C wasn't as racist as the later minstrel saying once the slaves were freed it's just there's a lot more gray areas in it there's different you know there's true mr. C versus single minstrel C there's just that there's the tunes and then there's some of the really horrible race the songs and then there's some vintage to songs you know so there's a lot of gray areas in in the music and in think it's really important to delve into it and to discover what is there and to say okay yeah that's really horrible maybe we won't sing that song you know but then we will play this tune oh maybe this song can be done you know with a little change or you know it tells us a lot about what was going on in the country at the time and the more we know about that the better we understand what's going and there were also black and white minstrels - that's something that's generally unknown after after the war that was they became some of the first ways that blackening cans began to have opportunities to perform on popular stage was going through blackface minstrelsy so first there were the white guys there doing it then there were black minstrels they said oh we can be blacker than the white guys in black so then we're going to be blacker than that so it became kind of an interesting interchange that happened even with that popular form so with a lot of the bounce of these Tunes it gives a lot of fodder for bones players especially with hubby and I being able to play as two different bones plays with their own particular styles we can really overlap some different rhythms in there and it's just beautiful seeing this is kind of the really the birthplace of modern syncopation where ragtime kind of emphasized a more sophisticated style of syncopation this has very you can tell the birth the syncopation so it's a very visceral syncopation that stays right at the core of the music so Simba some of the rhythms in these tunes or you know way more complicated and stuff that came that comes after you know but a lot of some of the tunes went on and became part of the American vernacular music but a lot of them didn't the only thing we have are that these people who sort of collected these students and then a lot and then then they started writing them and it sort of became its own thing but they wrote them down in these banjo instructors you know starting in like 1855 I think 1853 the gumbo chapter scepter and then it just continues on for the next half a century of people wanting to learn how to play the banjo so some of these instructors are the only ties we really have to this music and it's not it's not perfect I'd love to hear how a black person from 1815 play the banjo but you know we don't have that we have what we have is what we have and you know we have to be rewards the beginning of American music absolute getting of everything that we're hearing today and everything that came before new tweaks it's important stuff we gotta love it we can kind of spectrum it's not hard to love it because the music's awesome the words the problem energy problem it gets a little tear it get no it's not just a little hairy it's horrible there's some horrible words why don't you know you can have it you can't you can only blame a racist society yeah but you know you know what we do is you know we're performers were music but you know we you know we put see fiddle around a little bit but it's really important to acknowledge that the stuff was horrible absolutely it really was horrible but like that's not a reason to consign a hole in here stretch of music to the dustbin you know it's like that's part of our history one thing that we try to do in interpreting this stuff is try to present it with dignity and respect to the past as well as as the people now and also kind of show how we progress as a as a people so it's like you know we don't want to just go back in time so don't think that

would have made the Carolina Chocolate Drops as it was without having gone down to Joe's hello just something backing him up that really gave an extra little oomph to it that we didn't have before here's the last of his family to do nobody and his family picked it up nobody in the black community had picked it up and he had white musicians come down to play with them but nobody from a black community there was coming down and nobody like there are 15 black musicians would visiting him but nobody with any kind of regularity as to really get a feel for his music and the fact that there were three of us and then we're all going back together it was just kind of a I don't know just like made a band out of this this way all day it's great play these shows I mean the Chocolate Drops get the crowd so ham you know it's just great to be part of that process you know I mean it's a little funky after the show invariably something comes up and says man you know I heard you guys had this B box and I didn't know what it was gonna be but when I saw you oh now that teaching people things and educating people and you know you know finding all these missing roots to American music and being able to share that with people and so joining a band where that's one of the main missions of the group has been like a real nice thing and being able to show people like oh you know why couldn't play banjo so I couldn't finish we have we have string bands we did jazz we did blues we did this you know and just being a part of that that message has been a really good thing a large portion of it is on dance music you know of one kind or another whether it's you know Charleston or flat foot and rhythm or two-step with whatever its stance music and we feel really strongly even that people are sitting and listening we want if we want to feel like they could dance they got up you know move their butts you know they can't dance to it that also helped my music a lot in a way that I hadn't really thought about before and it's a very abstract sort of thing that that you kind of have to be able to visualize where the dance and the beach should be a lot of the old-timers who would have heard that stuff early on they appreciated that and so that was something that we felt and also being black performers that's something that would that was important too because we're I guess we're considered the first black string band first whole group to be playing at the Grand Ole Opry you know Marty Stewart he's a great advocate for the history of country music so for him to say it was a healing moment that's a beautiful thing it's comfortable you know and you sweat a little bit on that cool breeze hitch you're alright yes it's like being at the end of Splash Mountain you get the just like in the movies the the big line of photographers are like hey hey over here over here over here here here here okay over here okay let me see you over here and so you get that going on so it was like him before us and then right after us Herbie Hancock was getting a gain a Grammy and so yeah and he was wanting to see how the bones worked and so he asked me about those so that was that's a particularly member that stuck out for me was showing Herbie Hancock how the bones worked it's like one thing I've been trying to search out more is is search out the early roots of hip-hop and connect it with some of the old-time stuff that that I've heard and we want to really retain the old-time kind of poor you know it's not we're not trying to go too much and not just going to fusions for the sake of fusion you know I think for me more even more than the music that would be the greatest legacy to leave from having learned from Joe Thompson is like passing on stuff to children you know not necessarily in a classroom but just then being around it", "UTnqIpkM4nU": "[Music] yep [Music] oh you may wonder what's the reason for this creeping smile say i haven't been so happy for the

[Music]", "dLNwp0Q8lKQ": "i'm cadence the drummer i'm called the artist and we're the chocolate chocolate drops that's gonna be the last time we ever say that why is that [Music] well as you guys know yeah as you guys know it's it has been we've been the chocolate drops since for four years since 2017 oh okay but we made an official in 2017 and it's the end of era you know we started in 2016 officially 2017. and now it's 2020. so for those of you who may be new to our channel the reason why we came up with the chocolate drops uh so one as you guys can probably tell we have a lot of metal on it so nice chocolate skin so that's one aspect of it but then also growing up our mom would call us her little chocolate drops so pretty much that name pretty much stuck or we we stuck with it so then we were able to kind of incorporate that to our business and with us being twins people uh didn't really ever learn our names they just always were like hey twins hey chocolate yes those chocolate twins or it's funny even strangers would come up to you like hey chocolate so if that was just like a thing but i think that's pretty common with anyone with our complexion that that's what people call it but it just heightened it more because we're twins so um right after that we tried to we ran with it for you know as long as we could we decided to build a personal brand around it we got necklaces we got t-shirts t-shirts buttons we had a signature event that some of you guys attended paint and pop with the chocolate drops where we hosted paint parties in the bay area as well as our hometown of seaside and monterey um in the monterey peninsula so as well as the bay area so san francisco oakland boleo um that area too yup we had a pretty good run with the name um we were able to be in a fashion show we were able to remodel our like music video we were in the music video um so we did a few things here and there yeah yeah and we didn't buy photo shoots right when we got to the yeah definitely a lot of photo shoots because uh you know people really like our skin that we look really similar i don't know if you guys can do we look similar with our different hairstyles today but yeah um but we're you know we did all of those things and we as you're probably going like when's the last time you guys had a video we've been gone since the beginning of the pandemic in march we haven't tried any new content any videos as you can see now we're not even together we're in our home right now stay safe so yeah so pandemic hit uh for us well obviously everyone in march but specifically in california we were hit kind of hard so we were going down on lockdown a lot sooner than some of the other states so pretty much since march of 2020 we have not been able to quote unquote like be together shoot videos stuff like that like not even capacity that we were before even starting yesterday uh they issued a curfew again for california so that we'll be in the house for another month yeah so that has you know really affected the business in the sense that we can't be together and shoot our videos like we would normally do but we decided that we really wanted to still be able to create content for you guys so we decided that you know we got to try and do the zoom thing so we're going to see if this works let us know if you like it in the comments if you're like no you guys should just wait you can get back together um let us know yeah and um so after we've done some of these things we realized that moving forward in the you know it's we're approaching a new year 2020 has been very traumatic full of highs full of lows full of ups that we decided that cadence was the best part of being tcd and then also maybe 20 and 20. the best part of 2020 was getting my student loans paid off um that was a huge blessing i am very grateful that i don't have my student loans and things like keeping me down i don't have any more consumer debt i don't have any more medical debt so i am completely debt free that has been my highlight of 2020. the best part of being tcd i would say is you know i said the best part is just starting a business because i think we have a lot of gifts and talents just you and me in general and people in general and we don't use them i feel like we have a lot of power in our hands in our minds and our creativity and we just sit on them until we're back into a corner and forced to use them i would say the best part yeah so i would say we've always been operating as a team we're like a team that wants to kill each other one day and then we want to hug the next and then so right yeah so you know it's been that you know that's that's like the twin it's it's beyond sisters levels like yeah the twins like you hate each other you love each other yeah twin and multiple dynamic you guys are probably anyone that's watching this that's a twin or like really close in age with a sibling or something like that i think you can definitely relate to that yeah like you want to like kill each other but then you're fine right absolutely i would say the best part of of being tcd is that we actually have learned or learning to capitalize on things that we already do every single day work as a team kill each other pull it together get mad call each other back and figure it out so i would say that probably my best um best did you guys put my worst place no i just said this oh best okay so what would you say is your best so my best thing i would say that we did is tcd um it's not so easy is it best would maybe be i say branching out and doing things that we have never done so we had never modeled before yeah we had never uh created holiday cards and distributed we had never done um a lot of things actually so everything everything was the paint parties um keep in mind we have never been to a paint party i don't know if you guys realize that we've never ever attended an actual paint party in our lives minus ours so it was a new experience so i would say the best part was um having an idea for something and then actually seeing it become a reality okay what would you say is the best part of 2020 for you um i would say the best part of 2020 is even i even though sometimes i complain about this but i would say being at home with my family because i have definitely been able to see my son develop in in an amazing way like before he wouldn't say and i know this happens later but like he wouldn't say mom he would like nothing so like he's mama mama always says and i think that goes to being like i don't want to say more present but um you know we work late hours at work we do have jobs in addition to doing tcd so working late hours and we also commute so i usually get home really late i mean so i have to spend all the time like so i have limited waking hours with my son minus the weekends of course so i think being home uh or being able to work from home right now has been a blessing in disguise because i could see him more you know do everything more with him walks everything like that they've been the the best because it's okay well what would you say then if those were your highlights of the best parts what would you say is the worst part of being tcd and what's the worst part what was the worst part of 2020 so i would say the worst part of being tcd [Music] there are no worse parts even though it was straight like at times like even the parties are stressful things like that i always say everything is stressful well my thing is no like we like stress we have problems so we like doing things that get us worked up because it forces us to push our creativity and push our talent like to another level that we wouldn't think like i don't know if you guys know this i hate speaking in public she does i always she always makes me do it she acts like i like doing it but i really don't it's just that if we have to wait we're not open right now no but if we have to wait forever for her to want to do something i was like i'll just do it because this is taking forever it helps my my love of being since i'm so impatient it forces me to step up and do things that i would rather just be in the corner not really talking either but she would rather do it more so since she wants to do it more than me then i end up that's the case that's not what i wanted her she's right here but me not going to do something like that is like through the roof so yeah so i would say no worse part because it made me step out of my at least everything that we did i would say we stepped out outside of our comfort zones to get things done and we had finished product for everything um and then the worst i would say for 2020 is mainly just like the uncertainty because if i had known that we were going to be in this predicament back in march and now we're we're in november yeah like it's just the uncertainty is the worst because then i think i would have moved a little differently you know made some decisions a little bit different if i had known that this was going to be like we were in this for the long haul and it wasn't just like oh a flu that was going to be gone in like a month or something so that's the i guess if you can consider that the worst and one of the worst people i would say the worst part of tcd is i would say the worst part is that we fight but it's not really the worst part because that's normal if we didn't have tcd we'd still be fighting so now we have to fight about business things and like we need we i want to make money and we fight about that so i was that's not necessarily the worst that's like because the vines i would say that's normal because we fight anyway so i would say that and then the other the worst part of 2020 is that i would say um the worst it's the worst and the best part kind of that i live alone because sometimes i am so freaking bored and girl if you want to switch no come on no but in the same breath i do appreciate being able to come home and have solitude so i so i i'm not complaining like home alone i'm not saying that but i am like sometimes i do get bored with like i play my drums i do my keyboard i do my vibes i read i write read about like i do all my to watch tv sleep cook i do all those things but then it's like dang i kind of need another person here but not really because not that's not an invitation for anyone to want to try to move into my name oh i would say that has been a downside of 2020 now i'm not able to say almost in your apartment any day i'm just saying i haven't had an opportunity to socialize like i was hearing that i was preparing to to do um so i would say that that has been a downside that has not been worse so i already know it's probably coming to me next that's our mom was calling us um calling her now she's probably calling me but yeah that's been the downside not the worst part but definitely a downside um but that's it i would say that even though we've had a really good run we've decided that we no longer want to be tcd um cole do you want to elaborate on that we we want to level up on legal levels so tcd we've realized will not take us as far as we would like to go on the legal end now brand wise i'm sure we could go you know forever and ever and ever but we really want to make sure that we're able to take ourselves to the next level um if anyone has legal protection if anyone tries to challenge us we want to make sure that we can be like hey no this is and there's just too many people yeah trying to use the name so we yeah it will still be like chocolate so it's not like we're losing that completely or anything like that but just like legally we're just not gonna go fly that anymore so yeah and then and you know we're getting older this year we turned 30 we weren't able to celebrate our birthday the way we intended and we just want to be able to step into womanhood cole's already stepped into motherhood i'm walking into singlehood well i've been single so i guess i'm not walking into that i've been walking in that but we want to get into other levels of life and we just realized that maybe that brand um it's really just shelf life and possibly stepping or not possible and stepping away from like the the image too because we want this we want to take our brand to next level we don't want it to just be you know us and keep it to ourself and be selfish because you know i want other people to be able to enjoy it exactly everybody to be a part of the brand you know the journey that we're about to take or in the process of taking so yeah so um do you want to share what we've decided that we're going to do moving forward so our new name will be yeah we should have had a drum roll from your phone you can't really hear it i mean my drums are over there but my actual drums right here [Music] and the crowd goes wild you guys are like what did they say she said comparable say okay why comparable [Music] because we've been compared to one another for our entire lives in society people that don't know us people that do know us everything like that so we figured instead of just running from that being like i'm i do this she does that like we might we decided to embrace it so we're gonna go and change our name to comparable and we're the reason we've um decided to do comparable and we're going to spell out the word pear is because we are a pear you know we've always been a pair and we you know some of the greatest pears in history peanut butter and jelly yeah right chocolate and vanilla ebony and ivory um penis and coal so we decided then we're just gonna we're just gonna work through that and you know we're excited so if you guys see some changes on our social media changes and like everything don't be alarmed we just decided that we're gonna move in this direction just a new brand rebrand new year new brand um you'll probably be seeing our things in the in the fall winter winter winter not sure but you know stay with us so anything else you want to share cole um no go ahead go ahead i'm excited for the new brand the new name everything because i feel like i feel like things start happening in your 30s i know people always say that but i i really do feel like life really gets real in your 30s like life was already real in the 20s your 20s are all in preparation for your greatness and your thirds i would have to agree with that and i'm really excited because this this is new new energy new vibe new essence you know we can level up we can upgrade ourselves i just think it's i think it's all around good decision good move we have another level of even creativity that we are tapping into that we didn't know was there so stuff is just flowing oh one other thing i want to share we still have holiday cards available for purchase so if you guys would like to purchase them you can use the coupon code chocolate for 25 off and i'll put the link in the description if you made it to the end of this video you know what you need to do like comment comment share [Music] subscribe you", "O77-l9jDu-Q": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate chip scones or maybe you know them as scones this is a really nice tasting scone it has chunks of chocolate and dried sweet cherries and the dough contains buttermilk which makes a light and spongy almost bread likes gone so to begin pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 200 degrees Celsius and then line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper or you could just lightly butter it or spray it with a nonstick cooking spray and then I like to make my scones by hand so in a large bowl I have two cups which is 260 grams of white all-purpose flour and to that I'm going to add a quarter of a cup that's 50 grams of granulated white sugar and one in a quarter teaspoons of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon of salt and I'm just going to whisk that together you want to make sure that baking powder and the baking soda is all mixed into the flour because if you have any little chunks of like say baking soda baking powder that really gives a bitter taste which we don't want so you really want to make sure you whisk that in okay and then I'm going to add 1/2 cup which is 113 grams of butter I like to use the unsalted butter you could use salted if you use salted then just leave out the salt in the recipe and make sure your butter is cold and I like to like just cut it into small chunks because it's easier to blend into the flour now I like to do like I said this by hand and I usually use a pastry blender like this or you could use two knives or just your fingertips now if you want to you could put all this in your food processor and just process it until because what we're going to do is blend this into the butters and little small pieces so if you want to make it a little easier you could just put it into the food processor and do this step but I don't know I I always like to do this by hand scrape it off here is the chunks okay now if you decided to do this in the food processor then at this point just take the mixture and put it into a bowl because we want to do the rest by hand so I'm going to add a half a cup which is about 120 milliliters of these are like chocolate chump chunks you could use chocolate chips you can cut up a favorite chocolate bar and I'm using dark chocolate but of course you could use white or milk whatever you like and I'm also adding a half a couple hundred twenty milliliters of I'm using dried sweet cherries umm you could use cranberries if you don't want to use dried fruit you just leave it out or add them dried figs or something like that you couldn't nuts would be very good in here the great thing about asked and\u00f6 is so versatile you can kind of just you can put a little orange zest in here that would go nice with the chocolate as well so I'm just I'm just doing this by hand but you could stir with a spatula and then we need about 3/4 of a cup which is a hundred and eighty millilitres of buttermilk you could make your own buttermilk by just taking a cup of milk and adding stirring in a tablespoon of light lemon juice or a vinegar and just let that sit for about 10 minutes and then you have sour milk buttermilk so I'm going to add in to that 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and you can also I've noticed by buttermilk powder now and just have that container leave it in your fridge and so whenever you want to make scones you don't have to worry about running out to get buttermilk now I tend to add about almost about 2/3 of a cup about 160 milliliters I don't add all the buttermilk at once because you never know how much liquid your flour is going to absorb so just leave a little behind and let we'll just see how much it takes usually takes about three-quarters of a cup now the trick with the scon to make a really nice light scon is we don't want to over mix and that's why I like to do it by hand if you do it in a mixer you could easily over beat it and then your scone will be a little tough but if you do it by hand there's less of a tendency to over mix so I think I'm going to need it all also have a little extra on hand because you never know whether your flour will need a little more than that we're not adding a lot of scone recipes have an egg which we're not doing here and that the not using an egg also makes a lighter skon okay and all that flour mixed in okay this is signed and then you want to just lightly flour your surface and then just knead it a bit to bring it all together just a few times it's not like bread that you have to knead it for five or ten minutes and then just um you could use a rolling pin but I just use my hand I'm going to put it in about a roughly about a seven-inch that's about 18 centimeter round it's not that critical bit you can always get out your ruler here I'm just going to eyeball it possible right and then cut it I'm just using one of these bench scrapes use a knife just divide the circle in half cut down through those and then the chaff and half and then so we'll have eight scones altogether just arrange them on your baking sheet give them a little room because they they do rise okay and then I like to brush the tops of the sconce with a little milk just helps with browning you could also sprinkle a little more sugar on the top if you like to do that as you can see these are really easy to make have them in the oven like ten minutes at the most okay so into the oven somewhere 15-20 minutes until they've risen they're nicely browned and a toothpick inserted into the center will come up clean hey her scones are now done as you can see they turned a beautiful golden-brown color and a toothpick inserted in the center will come out clean scones are best the day they are made but you can cover and store them for a few days or they can even be frozen so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "Sbbo1ZJYz34": "you hey guys is TV booyah so today we're going to be making some chocolate brownies and it's coming up to holiday period here so it's almost Christmas and everyone loves eating sweet and healthy things enjoying the Christmas period so these brownies are just really easy to make and they're quick and perfect for non vegans as well because you can't really taste the difference between these and normal brownies so yeah let me know if you have any other holiday snack ideas or if you guys want any more holiday recipes and otherwise let's get started so the ingredients we'll need is white sugar brown sugar some flour pecan nuts some oil salt baking powder vanilla essence cocoa and dark chocolate drops from release whatever vegan chocolate drops you can find then you're gonna add some white sugar to your bowl some brown sugar to the bowl and then you're gonna add some cocoa powder you're gonna need about half what of the sugar that you added then you're gonna add some oil you can use any oil here I chose to use canola oil then you're gonna add half a teaspoon of baking powder two teaspoons of vanilla essence you can also use vanilla sugar here if you're in heaven Allah instance then one teaspoon of salt and then you just gonna mix that up until you all the ingredients are mixed together quite nicely once you're done with that you're gonna add your flour and then you're also going to add some water then you're gonna mix that all up together until it gets to a nice sort of moist consistency it's also really nice you can eat a teaspoon of this now and taste really good then you can add your pecan nuts or whatever other nests you chose your Chocolate Drops and then you're gonna mix that together as well if you don't have the Chocolate Drops you can try and find some vegan chocolate maybe but the Chocolate Drops on wheels are really really nice then you gonna place it all in the baking tray you can either spray your baking tray with spray and cook like I did or you can use baking sheets but I don't have any baking sheet sizes used a spray in cooking it works just fine then you're gonna is try and smooth that into the corners so that your brownies and I see even what's done of that you can add whatever toppings you want you to I out of more chocolate drops and then you're gonna put that in the oven at 180 degrees 15 minutes you might have to leave it in a little bit longer depending on your oven I end up leaving mine in about 17 minutes but depends obviously on whatever you have then you're gonna cut that up and enjoy it so that's it guys that a 3-speed please let me know in the comments if you give it a try and how it turned out for you you could also get creative with this recipe and add in whatever ever other toppings you want into it or add different types of nuts and just get credit for the let me know how it turns out otherwise have a really good holiday guys see you soon bye", "QRPXTV_q41U": "welcome everyone welcome to this live stream for all the recorded uh the replay if you're watching on the replay we're going to be making a beautiful little dessert it's a quick easy it's simple simple and easy same thing maybe delicious you can make these for yourself make them for the kids or with the kids just a beautiful thing there's no sugar you know when people say no refined sugar you know and they use coconut sugar i'm all for that i use coconut sugar as well but sometimes it's like well it's still kind of sugar there's still a process there the only sugar we're using is these beautiful um fresh soft medjool caramelly dates so they're going to be our our sweetener plus of course we're using sweet potato which is going to be sweet enough or it's gonna it's gonna bolster that sweetness so we don't have to add anything to it so i say let's just get on i'll get on with it i've got some in there in the cooker down here i'm just gonna in the oven i'm gonna close that up hopefully they won't cook anymore um some i made earlier which i'm going to show you at the end they're just just such a treat you know sweet potatoes one of my favorite vegetables actually one of my favorite foods there's such a nourishing food and actually really good to eat at night sometimes i like to have and maybe i'll do this as a little uh micro lesson on this channel as a um a little quick dessert i like to kind of make a sweet potato mash and then put some coconut yogurt in there and then what else do i have with it can you put your do you want to pull your microphone around say hello this is my beautiful girlfriend mia hey friends on the on the technical side on the techy stuff um what else do i put with that so i do like a sweet potato mash coconut yogurt um i sure have something else in there i can't remember some but what i'm going to do today i'm actually going to i haven't told you this yet i'm going to put some coconut yogurt on top of the cookie and i've got some i haven't had any of this for a while some bee pollen really really nourishing i believe it's got a whole bunch of amino acids but really wonderful stuff bee pollen sprinkle that over the top but what i was going to say was sweet potatoes so nourishing and because you know so many people talk about staying away from carbs or talking about how carbs if you eat them at night it makes you fat i've not found that at all i've actually found eating some carbs not always but sometimes at night it can really um it can really kind of settle down your nervous system and actually give you a really good night's sleep if you if you have some sweet protectors so yeah cold cold or warm sweet potato mash with the coconut yogurt i have a little bit of stevia vanilla stevia in there you could sweeten it with honey and would be lovely but let's get into today's recipe let's not get out of ourselves i've peeled the the sweet potato and you can find in the description for this video you can find the full recipe but i'm just going to cut these up into reasonably similar sized pieces if we could uh thanks my next purchase is going to be a little monitor here a little confidence monitor so i can see see what see what you're seeing but kind of look i'm looking over there at the moment trusting me that's why yeah just nice just nice to know what uh you know when i'm pointing things out what you can see um all right we're gonna go over to the food processor i forgot elton's here the little little french boy that's our dog by the way if you're new to this channel pick him up hey buddy pick him up pick him up here he comes here he comes way hello hello hello oh if you're watching this on the replay you're like get on with it all right i'll get on with it i know i shouldn't be picking up dogs and putting them on my apron but we're all we're in a family bubble here so as i always say i wouldn't be picking up my dog if i was making dinner for you so um that's that so it's raining so sweet potato then we've got some um almond ground almonds so this is we're actually using almond flour and we're using ground almonds and people kind of get mixed up or i think they're very similar or the same i guess they're similar in the fact that they come from almonds but almond flour has been defatted and ground almonds it's not just more coarsely ground it's actually got more of the fat still in there so we're going to put both of those in this is such a simple recipe it really is just just throwing everything in apart from the in fact so i put these up here apart from the chocolate chips everything else is going to go in so i'll talk you through these as we do it so baking powder in let's just go down the line here so we've got our medjool dates look how soft these are you take the take the stones out of these sometimes they have a little like that they have their little flower on the end there obviously you want to take that off as well and no real need to cut these especially if you've got you know reasonably powerful food processor they can just go in like that i'm using the sage or if you're in the us breville sous chef kitchen whiz i think it's called if you go to kit dot co forward slash eat like an adult you can see a kitchen list there that i keep up to date with all of my my recommendations um so let's get rid of those down here get rid of that little bit of stickiness of the date um let's go in next with the egg so one egg these fantastic clarence caught eggs that we get here in the uk they've got those really dark yolks wonderful then we'll go with a little just a pinch of salt a couple of pinches if you're feeling spicy just to bring out the flavor brings out a bit more the sweetness actually as well then we're going in with some coconut butter now coconut butter is different from coconut oil if you can just can you see that there um you can see that it's actually quite liquidy but that's only because i've melted it down um you'll find that when you get this in the jar it will have separated and you'll find that the coat there's a bunch of coconut oil on top um you know he's what's his treat that apple snaffles right there and he's like you probably can't hear it but so cookies for the dog yeah if i hurt my face you'll be able to see it oh yeah there he is okay so um coconut i was saying coconut butter different from coconut oil when you get the jar is what i was saying you'll see the coconut oil kind of separates and sits on the top and then the more the butter which is more of the fibrous part of the coconut sits on the bottom so whenever i get a new jar of coconut butter what i do is just warm it up and you want to warm up really gently you know you can do it in an oven but you don't want to warm up too quickly or too high because it will go rancid but i just like to get it warm i've actually got you can see when we see i've got a dehydrator over there um most of you probably aren't going to have a dehydrator but if you have got one it's perfect for that but just a really low setting on the oven and then i take it into actually yeah you can show the overhead here um i i just put it i take the whole um i empty the whole jar out into here it's a little bit of work you really have to kind of um you know get in there with a spoon and um even if you warm it up it's still going to be quite solid in there mix it all back together is the is the idea of this so you mix in the fiber and the oil get it all mixed in together get it in a um what's this called container get it in a container like this and it's so much easier to just again you can warm it up to to scoop it out or you can just as long as it's in a reasonably warm kitchen you can just you know scoop it out it's so much easier than using it from the jar so that's my little tip with coconut butter it makes it so much easier i'm just going to leave it at the top of there it makes it so much easier to cook with so we're going to go in with that if you haven't got it melted down it doesn't have to be melted down for this recipe if you've just got it um you know if you spoon it in and it's still and it's still quite solid that's totally fine the the food processor processor it's processor put my teeth back in the food processor should break it down so let's do that get this on oh i'm saying that now what's happening here my food process is getting stuck so first let's just loosen this all up get it a bit more distributed we go all right i will say it was just it just occurred to me that the easier you make coconut butter to eat like when you put it in a container like that it's just so easy to to go to the cupboard and get a spoonful of coconut butter out so you know you gotta watch out for that all right we're looking good there have a little taste lovely let's take this bowl that we started off with transfer it to the bowl and then we're going to stir in the chocolate chips because we don't want to we don't want to smash those into into smaller pieces and my ones doing in here good they're still looking good and then these are going to go into so at this point ideally when you start cooking but certainly by this point you would want to get your oven preheated 175 celsius what's that in what's that in fahrenheit if you go on the on the link on that we're just finding out here uh but if you go on the link on the on the site the recipe on the site 175 yes 350 fahrenheit yeah yeah that's correct yeah um all right so if we could go overhead here and then so we've got our mixture in chocolate chips in nice some nice dark chocolate chips and then you've got this lovely mixture ready to where did i put my my scoop for my ice cream scoop let's i don't know where i've got the other one but let's use let's use this unless i put it in here it was just sitting here a moment ago oh there it is if you can hear like a creaky door that's the dog asking to ask him to get up wants to be entertained yeah it's not entertained enough by you right i know i can't believe what is happening it's almost like as soon as we started doing this he wanted to be entertained okay you see that look at this it's still warm beautiful they are as a cookie goes a little bit more of a cakey cookie cakey cookie but just delightful look at those chocolate chips just nicely melted in there they're light fluffy a little bit crispy on the outside crunchy let's go for the eating shot um they are dangerous to have around i'm just gonna [Music] so good so let's take this off of here in fact let's put these on the plate i'll just put them on one of my dehydrator trays just because it's convenient and then i'll use the same bit of baking parchment beautiful so a an ice cream scoop about this size cookie scoop aka cookie scoop you should get about eight to ten cookies here so pretty simple i don't actually i don't really press it in and just get a decent scoop like that as you can see i've got eight last time i'm not sure how much of the the mixture i ate it wasn't that much it wasn't like a whole cookie's worth it can't have been a whole cookie's worth there we go oh it was apparently it was exactly a cookie as well there's no way i ate that now what i may have done i will admit i may have eaten a few tablespoons of chocolate chips is what i may have done it's really surprising that volume really adds up don't you don't you think it's falling yourself you don't think you're eating that much anyway so what i'll do here i'll just wet my fingers and then you want to just lightly press down on top here and obviously you know you can make your cookies larger but thinner if you want to but this is just how i've settled on these i think in the picture you if you've seen a picture of these they they are flatter and uh and wider so those go into the preheated oven for about 30 35 even 40 minutes you you're gonna have to call it yourself when you're ready for the when you're ready for um when you like the look of them because you know i like a little bit of browning on here um let's oh i'll tell you what there's a there's a small black plate back there like it's about this size or if you if there's one that's around that size we'll grab that i'm just going to grab some yes perfect i think is that one thank you i'm gonna grab some coconut yogurt so you know obviously you can just eat these as they are they're a great snack great to take out with you on the run if the cinema is ever open again you could do that if we ever go anywhere ever again you can take them there um if you're watching this in 10 years we're currently in the great covid pandemic of 2020-21 and um this is what it was like anyway cookie so we'll get some uh we'll get some i've got a little bit of coconut yogurt here unfortunately for you mia this has already pre-loaded with um and this is already pre-loaded with stevia i'm not even going to show your face because of that now i don't like stevia does not like stevia but i found myself just dipping into the fridge with this and just eating little bits of coconut yogurt and i i really like the stevia with vanilla so i thought i'll just add it to here i didn't foresee this situation where you'd be coming over and you know i just didn't think so do that lovely and then be pollen if you've never tried bee pollen before give it a go it's a wonderful thing oh i want to take a photo of that before i eat it but we'll just have to do another one for a new photo let's have a little i mean that's just a lovely little dessert if you're the type of person that like like me and mia you know that you really even though you're saying no dessert today and you just you get to the end of your meal and you're like do we really mean that i mean maybe just uh there's another i'll do another micro lesson for you as well on this channel for the other thing that we have which is mango ice cream right so mango frozen mango in the vitamix or actually the food processor can be can be a little bit less a little bit less work um so frozen mango with some uh i like you like it just like that right with always some maybe some oat milk in or coconut milk makes it into like a fluffy ice cream and then put a little bit of coconut yogurt with it on top yeah with no stevia no i like it with stevia and then with um uh with whey powder in with white powder and it's amazing and also with a little bit of colostrum because colostrum is really good for immunity and just i like the taste of it and it goes really well in that kind of ice cream so that's another one again i'll do a little micro lesson for you maybe we'll do a live stream for that actually even okay look at this i'm gonna go to the overhead on that one

are going to make chocolate chips at home so for making chocolate chips all you need is dark chocolate compound which is of 120 grams when piping bag 1 butter paper or a baking sheet in a tray first melt the chocolate you can melt the chocolate in a double boiler or a microwave so let's smell the chocolate first in a band take some water water must not touch another path so I'm adding my chopped chocolate to the bowl keep stirring the chocolate till it melts completely so our chocolate has melted nicely turn off the flame and let it come to the room temperature so here's our melted chocolate so I think that is ready cognitive of the pattern and start making it up my tips so our handful of chocolate chips are ready if you want you can keep it in the refrigerator for five minutes let's take them out so you can see it's so easy to strap them off from the baking paper [Applause] see how beautiful it has come out too [Music] [Applause] [Music] so our homemade chocolate chips are ready

ConsumerLab.com and I'm here to talk today about our tests of dark\nchocolate bars, cocoa powders, nibs, cocoa supplements... all kinds of cocoa-based\nproducts, cacao-based products, that contain high levels of flavanols,\npotentially; on the other hand, they may also be contaminated with the heavy\nmetal cadmium which is a kidney toxin. So we're basically looking -- when we test\nthese products at ConsumerLab -- to determine the levels of these two key\ncompounds: cadmium, flavanol. We're also looking for other heavy\nmetals. Fortunately, we didn't find significant amounts of lead or other\nheavy metals. So why even bother eating any of these products? Well, first of all,\nit tastes great if you like chocolate. Second, these flavanols can\nhave health benefits -- modest health benefits. Basically, studies have shown\nthat the cocoa flavanols can relax blood vessels, slightly lower blood pressure,\nslightly improve certain aspects on a short-term basis of memory and cognition,\nvery mild benefits for the skin in terms of wrinkles, and\nsome other benefits as well.  So let me get into really what to look for when\nyou're choosing these products, and these are just some examples of products that\nwe just recently tested. We've tested many others and all this is in our\nreport on ConsumerLab.com where we show all the information, our Top Picks,\nand if you're a member of ConsumerLab you can certainly get those reports on\nmany other health foods and all types of dietary supplements which we've been\ntesting now since 1999. So, first, in terms of a dark chocolate and cocoa, when you\nlook at a product and it says say, you know, 90% cacao or cocoa, what that\nmeans is the amount of cocoa liquor that's in the product as well as cocoa\nbutter. These are the two things, kind of key components, of cocoa beans,\nBy the way, you can actually buy cocoa beans roasted and cracked as cocoa nibs\nas well, which we also tested. Here is what cocoa nibs look like.  The issue\nthough when you're looking at a label is that since they're combining the cocoa\nbutter -- which has no flavanols, with the cocoa liquor -- which contains\nflavanols, you can't tell from the percentage on a\nproduct really whether it's going to be high in flavanols or not. In fact, we have\nfound that products, say, that claimed to be 72% cacao may have more\nflavanols than, say, a product that's 90% cacao. In terms of the\ncocoa powders, people typically use about one tablespoon of cocoa powder -- five\ngrams -- per cup of cocoa, and what we found is there is a tremendous variation in\nthe amounts of flavanols, and one of the big determinants there is whether a\nproduct was Dutched, or treated with alkali or alkalinized, or not, and this is what\na cocoa powder looks like that has not been Dutched. It'll have much higher flavanols than, say, a product like that looks like this --\nvery rich dark chocolate color that has been Dutched tor alkaline treated because that reduces the flavanols; it can reduce it by as much as\n90%, you know sometimes this may be half as much, but we did find that the amount\nof flavanols in cocoa powders can vary tenfold even within a brand whether it's\nDutched or not. So if you're trying to get higher levels of flavanols, don't get a\nproduct that's Dutched. If you don't really care about the flavanols and you\ngo more for taste, the Dutched products are less bitter. When you're dealing with\ndark chocolates, you have the same issue: Products that are Dutched, again will have\nlower levels of flavanols. Now the good news is, in our most recent\ntesting in late 2019, we found at least one cocoa powder that had a\ndecent amount of flavanols and very little cadmium, which is a\nvery different case from some other products which might have had higher\nflavanols but much higher levels of cadmium. There is a limit as to how much\ncadmium you should get. Canada has set a limit -- for adults it's about 4.1\nmicrograms per day, for kids it's about 3 micrograms per day.\nCalifornia has a similar limit based on the the 4.1 limit. Many of the cocoa\npowders will exceed the limit for children -- nearly all of them, \nexcept for a couple that we we found this year. Some will also exceed it for\nadults, so, you know, if you're just buying something off the shelf, I wouldn't have\nmore than one cup of cocoa powder -- of cocoa -- per day, to play it safe. If you\nknow it's in there, you know, you look at our report, you can go a\nlittle higher. In terms of how much flavanol you actually want to get to get\ncardiovascular benefits, memory benefits, you need at least 200 milligrams per day,\n500 milligrams -- actually the memory benefits kind of kick in there, even up\nto 900 milligrams per day. It's hard to get that with some of these products. You\ncan turn to a cocoa supplement which is made from a cocoa extract where they've\nextracted the flavanols out, concentrated it, and put it into basically a powder\nwithin a pill. On the other hand, there are cocoa flavanol supplements that\nwe've tested that were virtually the same as cocoa powder -- they were not\nextracts and they really contained just a couple of milligrams of flavanols\nversus the hundreds of milligrams that you'll get from a capsule of a very good\ncocoa flavanol extract.  In terms of the cocoa nibs, unfortunately they are also\ncontaminated with with some cadmium, so, you know, you need to go easy with those.\nNone of them really passed our test because based on the suggested serving\nsizes they all exceeded the 4.1 micrograms per day, but there was one\nthat was better than the others, and, again, all that is in our report. \nSo that's about it for cocoa and chocolates. Again if you go to\nConsumerLab.com you will see the results for each of these products. We\nalso have price comparisons, information also about the calories that you'll get\nfrom eating each of these products. For example, if you choose one of the very\nhigh flavanol cocoa dark chocolate bars you can eat only, basically, about 1/3 or\nless than from another, you know, high percentage cacao dark chocolates to get\nthe same amount of flavanols -- and you'd obviously be reducing your calorie\nintake, you know, by 1/3 as well. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them where you see this video. We put these videos out with every\nreview that we publish, so you may want to subscribe if you want to see our next\nvideo and be alerted to that. Also we encourage you to join ConsumerLab so\nthat you can access all of our information -- we've been publishing these\nreports since 1999 and have covered nearly every type of dietary supplement\nas well as all types of important healthy foods like dark chocolates, olive\noils, etc. Again this is Dr. Tod Cooperman.

pillow well do I like my sheet much better to alack that pretty fair maid who stands at my bed fie he called a servant man to go saddle the dappled roan and here over father's house that night knocked

fine for I want to kiss those cold cold lips for I know they'll never kiss smile three times he kissed her cold cold hand twice he kissed her cheek and once he kissed her cold cold lips soon he fell in her arms asleep", "6a1gYk0nJW8": "hi today we are going to be tempering chocolate what you need for it is a slab master you'd not sure best to use natural rock I've got marble here so why you need natural rock is because they're full metal rocks and they won't take the heat off the chocolate really quick so that will they will cool the chocolate instead what I'll sing it for it you need a scraper to spread eat chocolate around your slab and you need a pilot knife but I've lost mine that's why I'm using knife just to make kind of the job quicker and easier one thing you need ideally for tempering chocolate either thermometer you can use a candy thermometer if you've got one you want to use it I'm using a laser one because I just find it easier and it says it gives kind of a rough temperature but every time I've turned with my chocolate this and a thermometer it was absolutely fine so I would advise you to use this one so first thing you will need to do is obviously melty chocolate heat to get my milk chocolate 243 degrees celsium you can multi chokolate over water bath if you want or you can multi toggle it in a microwave if you used water bath just make sure that the bottom of a dish doesn't touch the water and that your saucepan the rim of it is smaller than the dish that you're going to put on top so the steam is trapped and no water no liquids gets into the chocolate that's why I prefer using microwave because if you get water in your chocolate you kind of ruined it and as well I will advise you not to use glass dish or whatever your multi chocolate in because glass will hold the heat so after you take your chocolate off the heat will stop melting in the microwave it will still continue heating it I'm going to mount my chocolate in the microwave and I'm going to have 30 seconds intervals between each melt and I'm going to give it a stir every time and going to get it right temperature so I'm melting my chocolate and I dropped it to 43 degrees something so now I'm going to pour 70% of this mess last lap [Music] I'm going to pull it down to 25 degrees and with dark chocolate it will be 27 degrees so don't leave your chocolate just sitting there and try not to leave it's hard it's difficult first time try not to leave any kind of trails so chocolate doesn't get crispy with those sides so this is definitely the messiest way of doing it but I find it the easiest way because it takes no time to cool it down and then you can lose it pretty quick 25 where were you 25 and 3 so now the messy even Messier part we need to add this chocolate do the rest of your chocolate that you left a bowl stir it all together now your chocolate needs to be 28 29 degrees Celsius and your dark chocolate 30 to 31 degrees just check that that's perfect to buck with so now your chocolate is ready to use this is the second method you can use if you want to temper chocolate you need to multi chocolate well in the microwave or using the walls above and then you're going to add or very tampered chocolate to your melted one and you will need to add 15 to 20 percent and stir it in and get it to the working temperature if that will happen that you must eat chocolate you've added your 15 to 20 percent and the chocolates melted but it's not the right temperature so what you need to do just add a little bit more what happened it is you've overheated your chocolate and that's why it will take a bit more tempered chocolate try to get it to the right temperature now I'm going to melt this chocolate yes see this so much chocolate is melted then I'm going to add my chocolate and just stir it in until it melts so all my chocolate is melted now let's check the temperature it's twenty eight point four degrees so it's perfect to use no",

can play just about anything there's also Lela from New Orleans and hubby Jenkins from New York City but the Carolina Chocolate Drops packed the house they entertain and educate with music history mind people are there to listen to music and we feel like you get more out of the music if you just know just a little bit and people we were finding is that people really like that they go oh I really like knowing about the history tidbits like the banjos origins as an African instrument played by slaves knowing that this is an 1840s replica banjo if I play something on this banjo that sound you all of a sudden go oh I can hear where that way used to be you know a gourd banjo you know African instrument well the bones are actually cow short rib bones they became popular through the blackface minstrel shows yeah I mean those are those are those are different things that that are happening rhythmically while teaching is now in the Carolina Chocolate Drops bones when the group first got off the ground their own education included an obscure film about a black East Tennessee musician you know Dom has this this documentary little movie Louie bluey and so we're watching this and just go man this is awesome like this dude was so cool a town that I grew up in let's call the Father Tennessee completely blown away by his story which tells a lot about black string band the music was really great as well he plays this this old-time to with this white piano player and it was actually the version of cackling him that he does that is totally not yourself and it was just like oh my god this jazz fiddler knew all these old-time to is just kind of like brought home to it we're just all about Lulu and it was just movie blue this Louie Louie that before Armstrong was nicknamed Louie blue II he played with his brothers in a band called the Tennessee Chocolate Drops we were just talking about how cool was that he was in a black string band called CNC Chocolate Drops and I was like oh why don't we just call ourselves the Carolina Chocolate Drops I mean it was really like that casual so we just a Carolina Chocolate Drops and that was it after the Tennessee Chocolate Drops Armstrong's musical career mostly used his band members real names Martin bogan and Armstrong Carl Martin Ted bogan and Howard Armstrong had been playing together for 40 years the group billed as one of the original black string bands could play just about anything with notes and a lot of that diversity derived from Armstrong's childhood in LaFollette where the local iron company recruited skilled European workers to operate the blast furnace Howard learned German and Italian from neighborhood children and I got a Hugh fake-nice I'll tell you and I feel so fine I just couldn't eat those grits and gravy when I got back home you know Armstrong's appetite for international cultures melted multiple musical backgrounds into majestic melodies I had a woman singing our songs and in Germany God said my god as well I saw a black Dortmunder door and he'd be singing up the revolvers to loose me man well they say music is a universal language a guy brought to hear you play a beautiful song and hear you running some guy out at me understand and Armstrong spoke the universal language with fluency rarely found among even the finest Fiddler's [Applause] and after the amazing fiddler in mandolinist his devotion to trying to play a lot of different styles in a lot of different languages that's the way of the true songster I didn't have time I think of hate prejudice and all that stuff I played song to people on the head right in life vividly armstrong's all-around artistic ability gave him a signature style in almost everything he did it was artwork that brought him back home again in 2000 when knoxville unveiled its music mural and in the city where his tennessee Chocolate Drops recorded songs like the knox county stop and the Vine Street rag the 91 year old proved he could still put on a one-man mandolin show for WB IRS the Heartland [Applause] [Music] Armstrong died in 2003 today lafalot celebrates his life with the annual Louie bluey festival and the Smithsonian also honored Armstrong with its National Heritage Award now Armstrong's legacy lives on with a new generation of Grammy winning musicians who played black string band music and build upon

(laughing) (upbeat jazz music - I love dark chocolate. Chocolate makes me happy, man. It gets me through some stressful days. It's sweet. It just brings joy to my life. What's there not to like about chocolate? - Just thinking about chocolate\nis making my mouth water and it's making my heart happy because chocolate has\nalways been a reward. It's always been an indulgence. Chocolate is the purest joy in the world next to dogs and cats. - I think 100% dark chocolate is gonna be mind-blowingly amazing, super sweet. Pure dark chocolate,\nit's gonna be the best. - Yeah. So we are here at Tache in the Lower East Side of New York City, and we are going to\nlearn all about chocolate and eventually try 100% pure chocolate. So, Aditi, tell us a\nlittle bit about Tache. - Sure, so tache means\nspot or smudge in French because every time I'm wearing\nmy chef coat or my apron, I usually have a smudge of\nchocolate on it somewhere. So hopefully you will leave with a smudge of chocolate on you. Actually, you don't have aprons, so... (laughing) Hopefully it'll be in your mouth. So, I do have a variety of chocolate. So, white chocolate, not\nreal chocolate, guys. - What? - Yeah, white chocolate is made up of cocoa butter, milk solids, and sugar. So, it contains absolutely no cacao. - My mind is blown right now. So this isn't real chocolate? - Let's go up the scale. So, let's try some milk chocolate. - Loving it. - This is what heaven is like. - The main differences\nbetween milk and dark, milk chocolate contains\na ton more milk in it and it also contains some cocoa mass, some vanilla to give it\na little bit of flavor, and some cocoa butter. - It says it's only 35% chocolate, so it can only get\nbetter from here, right? - Yeah, exactly. It has to. - So, the next one that\nyou guys are trying is an 81% dark chocolate. I think you'll be able to taste\nmore of the nuances in it. - This is a different level. This is sort of like,\nthere's a bitterness to this. - It's just like blowing my\nmind to taste pure chocolate. - It's like, and we haven't\neven reached pure chocolate yet. We're at like, 81%. - We haven't reached nirvana? - No. (laughing) - Obviously, 100% chocolate\nis 100% chocolate, but what does that mean? - So, 100% chocolate comes\nwith no frills attached, so it is just an organic chocolate mass. Basically, they take cacao beans and they ground them up nice and fine, and then they form it\ninto a nice little brick that looks like that. When we get it, we just chip away at it and put it into our\ndouble boiler over there and melt it and make it\ninto wonderful concoctions. I like that. - All right, all right. - [Aditi] I think that looks great. - Let's get ready for\nthese silky mouth feels. - All right. (laughing) - Heaven tastes a little\ndifferent than I thought. Your chocolate is definitely bold. - Whoa, man. Bitter is just it. That is like the best\nway to describe this. - I don't know, kind of\nlike the taste of tobacco or like, a cigar. - So this is like literally day and night. I mean, not just based off how it looks, but definitely by the way it tastes. - This is like a little kid when their parents give\nthem wine and they're like, \"Oh, I know this is supposed\nto taste good, but it doesn't.\" - It's an acquired taste. - I guess I was naive in not knowing what the taste of chocolate was, because the chocolate\nwe know is mixed with vanilla, and cocoa butter, and sugar, and all these great things. It just shows just how brilliant the chocolatiers of the world are. Having the more pure\nchocolate made me realize I'm a basic chocolate\nlover, and that's okay. - I'm gonna ask you to rest\na little piece of chocolate in between your tongue\nand the roof of your mouth and kind of swish it around your pallette like you would do with fine wine. - [Man] What? We're getting fancy as hell in this chocolate factory.", "z1dHYZgko_k": "hey sugar geeks lives here again today we're gonna learn how to temper chocolate what's that mean we're gonna learn all about it coming up next on the sugar geeks show so what is chocolate chocolate actually consists of two important things cocoa solids and cocoa butter cocoa butter is the part of the chocolate that turns liquid when you heat it and when chocolate is tempered it has a crystalline structure that aligns perfectly and makes chocolate have that shine released from mold has a snap when you bite into it and when you melt chocolate that crystalline structure gets demolished and as chocolate cools that crystalline structure is gonna start developing again but we want to control how those crystals come together so let's imagine that this is chocolate it's all tempered and everything is aligned this is the cocoa solids and this is the cocoa butter this is what we want our chocolate to be but when you melt chocolate we're separating the cocoa butter from the cocoa solids so as the chocolate is cooling the cocoa butter and the cocoa solids are gonna want to come together and recreate a crystalline form any way that they can but we want to control that and only let it form the crystals that we want it to form at a hundred degrees at 90 degrees at 95 degrees all of these different temperatures these crystalline structures are going to start forming and we want to control that and the way we control it is through agitation so as those crystals start forming at a hundred degrees nope not the right crystals let's stir stir stir stop those crystals from forming and then when it gets to 95 degrees that is where the right crystals are gonna start forming the tempered chocolate crystals and magic crystals so it's really important that you add you get your chocolate up until the point that it starts developing these crystals and then we want to cool the chocolate all the way down to 79 degrees to give time for those crystals to fully develop and to grow the stronger these crystals are the better your chocolate is going to be tempered now how do we get those crystals to form properly I'm going to show you three different ways that you can for your chocolate important thing to note when we're talking about this form of temporary and chocolate we're talking about semi-sweet or dark chocolate if you're working with milk chocolate or white chocolate that you're gonna work at very slightly different temperatures those are listed on the blog post so what type of chocolate is best for tempering well basically you're going to need something that is real chocolate what do I mean by real chocolate I mean it has to have cocoa butter in it there's basically two types of chocolate compound chocolate and real chocolate compound chocolate is gonna have other things in it besides cocoa butter like vegetable oil hydrogenated palm kernel oil basically things that aren't cocoa butter and the reason that compound chocolate exists is because you can just melt it and it will harden up all on its own but it's not going to release from a chocolate mold like real chocolate is going to release so you can use it for cake pop so you can use it to make water ganache you can even use it to make ganache to frost a cake but it's not going to be good for using in candy molds the other thing is real chocolate melts basically at body temperatures so when you put a piece of beautifully tempered delicious chocolate in your mouth mouth is watering it's gonna melt on your tongue and just like have that really great mouthfeel compound chocolate melts at about a hundred degrees so you actually have to chew it to consume it so it doesn't have exactly the same sort of like you know mouthfeel but does anybody else notice that me probably not so you might think that you can tell if chocolate is real chocolate or fake chocolate like if it comes in a candy bar oh it must be real not necessarily always check the ingredients if it has cocoa butter in it it's real chocolate hahaha alright so for a tempering or chocolate we need some very simple tools the most important one being our spatula this spatula has a thermometer built into it so it's going to help us keep an eye on how hard our chocolate is at all times secondly we're going to be using a silicone bowl or a plastic bowl is fine just so that it doesn't trap any heat in the bowl and we keep all of the temperature controlling in the chocolate if you're using any method besides the microwave version of temporary and chocolate you're going to need a double boiler and then lastly you're just going to want a knife to chop up your chocolate into small pieces or you can use a grater if you're using a bar so the first way is called the seeding method this is the most common way of tempering chocolate and is the most difficult in my opinion because it takes so long basically you take a large amount of chocolate and you melt it down usually over a double boiler until it reaches about 115 degrees no more than 120 you don't want to burn it and then we want to start cooling that chocolate down and the way that we cool it is by adding in more chocolate that hasn't been melted this first part of the chocolate is just to help cool it down we're stirring we're stirring st. crystals don't develop yet we're just cooling cooling cooling cooling this can take a little while which is why it's not my favorite method but once you get to 95 degrees you want to make sure that there are a few bits of unmelted tempered chocolate in that bowl because those tempered crystals attached to the untempered crystals and make everything tempered again at 95 degrees so it's really important to be agitating your chocolate until you get to that point and then we're going to cool the chocolate all the way down to 79 degrees still continuing to agitate occasionally to just make sure the temperature of the chocolate is consistent inside and outside and then once we get down to 79 degrees you're gonna take a little of that chocolate place it in the fridge let it cool for five minutes and then do a test okay so this is our hopefully tempered chocolate when I peel it off the parchment it should release very cleanly no residue so if this is tempered it should have a snap oh yes you see how how sharp that break is that is tempered chocolate it's shiny that way I know it's going to release from the molds if it's not tempered this is chocolate that I know is not tempered I just melted it and poured it on to the parchment here when you peel it off it leaves a residue it's not clean it's a dull it's not shiny and then when you go to break it it literally will not snap it just bends very sad so this is a good way of knowing if it's tempered or not if it's not tempered just heat this back up to 94 degrees add in some more chopped chocolate to reseed it and cool it to 84 if it is tempered then you want to go ahead and heat it up to 85 90 degrees no more than 95 degrees otherwise you are going to ruin all of those crystals that you just spent all that time growing method to is using something called beta crystals which is something you can buy on Amazon and I'll put the link on the blog post but basically what this is is a freeze-dried tempered cocoa butter so you can just melt down your chocolate cool it to 95 degrees and add in a couple of scoops of these beta crystals and it will immediately start forming those crystalline structures and because it's freeze-dried and like this powder it just melts really quickly and it's kind of like a foolproof way of tempering your chocolate but the same process heating to 115 cooling to 95 adding her beta crystals cool all the way down to 79 and then heat back up to 85 90 degrees for workability boom boom boom the last method the most important method the method I literally just learned so yeah now you know my secret I learned something and then I just teach it to you tempering in the microwave so I didn't even I've heard of this process I didn't understand it because it just seems so easy that I'm like there's no way that this was possibly work and I tried it and it did I couldn't believe it so we already know that crystals develop at 95 degrees and they get at 95 degrees in theory you can melt your chocolate and as long as it never goes above 95 degrees you do not ruin those crystals that make the tempered chocolate tempered but how do you melt chocolate without ruining you know those crystals the microwave so I'm going to show you how to do that so to temper in the microwave we're gonna place 12 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate I'm using Callebaut I'll put the link to the type of chocolate that I'm using in the blogpost and we're going to chop this chocolate up finely this is important especially if it's a big bar you want to grade it the smaller the piece is the easier it's going to melt and the less chances you will have of accidentally heating it to cockt we're going to put this chocolate into a plastic or a silicone bowl so that it doesn't get too hot usually you would melt chocolate on a double boiler but the glass really holds on to heat so that's gonna ruin our temper we don't want to use glass so we're gonna start with 30 seconds and then stir and then 30 seconds again and stir and then we're gonna do 15 seconds and then we're going to do 10 seconds and the second you see that most of your chocolate is melted you don't heat it more just keep mixing until it's all melted I'm using my spatula it has a thermometer in it that's gonna help me keep an eye on the chocolate to make sure it's not getting above 90 degrees this is like my safe zone because inevitably you might accidentally go up to 92 so if you don't get past 95 you're probably going to be okay but I say stay under 90 for your safety because if it's above 95 and that can happen very easily then the temper is ruined so what happens if you accidentally overheat your chocolate which definitely will probably happen at some point don't worry your chocolates not ruined it's just that the temper is broken so go ahead and use one of the other two methods like the seeding method or the beta crystals to get your chocolate back in temper so once your chocolate is melted its tempered it's already tempered we never ruined the temper one thing to note is that this really only works for small amounts of chocolate if you need to temper a huge amount of chocolate you're probably gonna have to use the seeding method or the beta crystals but for little small molds and little simple candies this is the perfect way to temper chocolate once you're done making all of your fancy chocolates and stuff you might have leftover chocolate what I do is I take this tempered chocolate and pour it on to some plastic wrap or some parchment spread it out thin let it set up and then break it up into small pieces so that I can use this tempered chocolate again so now that your chocolate is tempered you can go ahead and use it for candy molds to make chocolate spheres or you can use it to just pipe out fun stars and hearts like I do for my daughter Avalon to use as treats or being a good girl hey everyone oh look what I got you want a chocolate star yeah I don't know did you get did you feed the guinea pigs yeah did you give them their pellets did you eat all your breakfast yes okay well then I think you get a chocolate star oh of course you picked the big one she knows what she's doing yeah good job so that's how you temper chocolate hopefully you guys have enjoyed this video new videos every Tuesday don't forget to subscribe", "IcuFJCl5FFk": "Today I will be making chocolate almond candy. This recipe is my granddaughters' request. I was spending some time with my two granddaughters and they decided they wanted to make chocolate\n(homemade candy). So we did it. Both granddaughters had so much fun experimenting with different versions of this candy and making a big mess. We knew we wanted something rich and chocolaty and for an extra crunch some type of nut. Chocolate and nuts combine never fails. This is a quick and easy recipe with very few ingredients. This recipe will make 16 candies. And for this recipe we will need: 1 cup almonds coarsely ground 1.25 cups semi-sweet (baking chocolate bar) or 5 oz. of chocolate, chopped in small pieces. 3 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk. 1 teaspoon of sprinklers of your choice.\nThis is optional. This is a very easy and simple recipe. First I will melt the chocolate in microwave and then mix almonds, condensed milk and little chocolate together and make it into dough. Then divide them into about 16 pieces and roll them into balls and dip them in melted chocolate and then candy is ready, but just wait. Chocolate takes about 7-8 hours before it dries. And then candies are ready to enjoy. Let's get started. I am ready to melt the chocolate in microwave. And I will do it for 30 seconds. It has been 30 seconds. So let's take it out. And mix it. It's not melted but you do need to do this. And now I will put it back again for another 30 seconds. It has been 30 second again. So let's check it. And now it is looking quite soft. Mix it. I think we need to put maybe for another 20 seconds. We cannot overcook the chocolate. And see now it will melt, while we are mixing it together. It's looking good. So I am ready to mix the almonds. And condensed milk. And just mix it together. And put about tablespoon of chocolate. I have greased my fingers. So I will just clean this spoon. And mix it. It will be like a dough. It's looking good. And now I will divide them into about 16 pieces. So tablespoon, I have already greased. So it will be easy to take it out. So first let's divide them. I have washed my hands and greased my palms again. So I can make them in rounds. This time I made about 14 pieces. Now I am ready to dip them in chocolate. So this plate is already greased. So let's take one at a time. Make sure it's covered all sides. And just tap it. Put it in the plate. Make sure they are not very close to each other. They are looking very good. The only bad thing is it just takes too long to dry. With my granddaughters, I was putting them in refrigerator. So they can dry quicker. They couldn't wait. This is easier to work with fork because it's flat. I have dipped all the balls in the chocolate and they are looking really good. And I am just going to lightly sprinkle them. And you can sprinkle them with your choice of anything. Or don't sprinkle. But my granddaughters wanted to sprinkle it so I thought I will do it. Wow! Chocolate almond candies are looking great. These candies will be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. Enjoy. Thank you. Till we meet again, check out more recipes on manjulaskitchen.com. And also look for my eBook on Amazon.

string band a different string band than usual were we're a all-black string band which is kind of an anomaly nowadays but at one point around the turn of the century and before black string bands were more common and then even actually dominant in the music of black culture who classified of the string Bank as we play all stringed instruments but really just an early American music man I'd say so we run the gambit from dog ears just started learning the quills which are kind of a panpipe tune African style which were played by black people in them and the South in bones and harmonica and we're working on the five we have snare drum so we really try to go through a lot of old American music traditions that are more or less forgotten you know we do some really early blues some really early jazz stuff stuff to people oh come on I got into it from hearing a broadcast MPI broadcast about Joe Thompson so who was an 87 year old 88 now year old black FID blood from Mebane North Carolina and I was like wow would be really great to learn from him Vincent I I was interested in bluegrass and early country before that but this kind of gave me a direct in wrote to what I wanted to do so I've been running around doing music for several years probably about eight or nine years now and then I got invited to the black banjo gathering and I fell in love with the North Carolina music scene as well as the people it's just been absolutely positive experience and that's how I've gotten into it I just have picked up any music every which way that I can get it the reactions people have given us have been very positive so far and they've just opened their hearts up consider how you guys are doing something that we really enjoy there's one other member of the band is Leith the question yeah who's not here that's Rihanna engagements he's there i banjo player a fiddle player in our singer that's why she's not here another man dem gaan is from a few recording that Alan Lomax did of Veera Ward Hall in Alabama in 1940 and it's just a little like kind of soul cleansing song to to let let out the you know let the bad feelings out with and rien does a hell of a job on it it will Russia from B B's he said that the two acapella songs she did were the two times he's ever seen B B's completely silent when she starts singing it's there's a certain way that the world stops and it's almost like it's almost kind of like you get into this this grey space where it's just you and you and her and that's and you know if 500 people are doing that all at one time that's a that's a that's an amazing thing from the town I didn't name I didn't know his name I didn't know his name I don't know where I don't know where he's gone I don't know where he's gone I don't know where he's gone he had he had a long chain know he had a long chain oh he had a long time I'm gone this is American music in general like we we we we particularly highlight the part about being a black string band but this is music for everybody everybody was playing this type of music at one time there was lots of intersection going back and forth between black communities and white communities and you know the music kind of all got smashed together this one pot where everybody could you know take a little bit of it but it's not and clearly it's not like that anymore and that's one of the things we we like to put out there and also one of our messages that we're kid to lawyer who are coming up and who are younger that there's something other than MTV there's some husband BET's that you know there's lots of different ways to make music you don't you don't have to be you know a studio you know rapper or you don't have to you know know how to make beats on a turntable and there's lots of different ways if you can make music and to make good music that people are gonna enjoy listening to that's one of my that's one of my things and this this links to a certain term that sue they Greg Wilson who I mentioned earlier laid on us which is Sankofa which is a Shanthi term in West African term that means you know go back and fetch it grab the past and bring it forward with you all the good things that you want to take you know put it with the present bring it to the future and that's one of the things we do is a lot of the old timers even though you know people now will though they'll categorize stuff which is just natural but all the old timers they just picked up tunes that they wanted to do and so that's what we do we we will have a tune and you know like ricketts hornpipe for example i'm playing the snare drum and justin's on the on the fiddle and Rhiannon's on the banjo we we just took a tune that Joe mentioned that his daddy played and then we just changed it around however we felt and what we thought would work very well so we use all the traditional materials but we do whatever we've whatever we feel in ourselves and what you know where the energy takes it so he totally mine I learned that song from a series of recordings on the old hack record label called music from the law provinces which is music from three counties in North Carolina in Western North Carolina and that tune was played by I think the Smith County Ramblers but they you know we should say kind of fun mountain mountain type tune that we we like to deal with have some good lyrics to it it's not anything historically significant you know more than more than it's a really good tune that's fun to dance off and doesn't leave you", "1Ad9FPufpSw": "I've got a special treat for you today with the recipe created by Kim our director of creative design oh and did I mention it's chocolate stay tuned hi my name is Katrina welcome to the organics channel where we make living healthy easy and fun today we will be making a dark chocolate super seed bark the first step is to melt your bittersweet chocolate in a double boiler now if you don't have one you can just make one you want to take a pot and put about two inches of water on the bottom and then bring the water to a boil once your water comes to a boil turn down the heat to keep it at a simmer and then either out a glass or a metal bowl right on top making sure that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water and now it's time to add our chocolate add in your chocolate in here into the bowl this just allows you to heat up the chocolate over a lower heat rather than a really high heat [Music] and then taking your spatula stir it up as it melts [Music] once your chocolate has melted remove it from the heat and add two scoops of our collagen powder [Music] and once two drops of either peppermint or orange essential oil I'm just going to use one drop and I'm also going to use a spoon underneath just to make sure I don't get too many drops in there to see it happen just one mix this all up really well [Music] when everything is mixed up go ahead and take a baking sheet and line it with parchment paper this is just so that it won't stick when we're ready to take it out and then go ahead and take all of your chocolate and carefully pour it on spread it out to your desired thickness [Music] take your mixed seeds and go ahead and sprinkle it on top of your chocolate now I went ahead and added some coconut cranberries raisins and a little bit of almonds to my seeds just to give it some extra flavor but you can use whatever mix of seeds that you like and then just spread as much on as you want also remember that seeds are nutrient dense so you don't need a lot of them to get all of their health benefits once you've added your seeds go ahead and place your pan in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to let the chocolate harden and set when your chocolate has set break it up into bark sized pieces [Applause] [Music] you can store your chocolate bark in the refrigerator or freezer in a covered container for up to a good month [Music] it is time for our rigorous food critics to give their honest opinion come on in

we're gonna do some blood tests this morning I want to check out what Lily's caramelized and salted a bar does to me it's currently almost 10:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning haven't eaten anything since last night at about no no no I actually had a bite of something at like a really late 11:30 but haven't eaten anything today since waking up we'll see what my resting blood glucose and ketones are so I've been using this freestyle precision precision neo picked it up at Walmart for like 20 bucks because the test strips are pretty cheap as well and then I also have this keto Mojo to test my ketones and I've got also some some test strips from quito mojo i've got a link actually in the description of this video to pick up one of these the readers a discount code i don't remember what it is I'll put it in the description these I do not have a discount code for these are kind of where they get you their ketone test strips so first let's test my blood glucose alright first finger prick of the day of five two my account this is fasted first thing have any had morsel or drink a drop yet this morning 83 is my resting blood glucose and now let's test my ketones I'm curious because I did have something late last night to eat you know was keto let's who would get zero point two millimeters per deciliter okay this is my favorite Lily's bar by far don't be fooled by salted caramel and it looks similar caramelized and salted is the one to go for so good our chocolate is sweetened with stevia a zero calorie natural sweetener prized for its many health benefits stevia has sweetened foods and beverages for centuries our use of stevia gives Lily's unnatural richness and a lot less calories all at least I love you but that's a lot fewer calories okay here are the nutrition facts the serving size is 40 grams there are two servings per container I mean have one serving 160 calories 15 grams of fat oh man there's gonna be it for me today for carbs 22 grams of total carbs 12 dietary fiber 7 sugar alcohols so that's three net carbs per half bar 6 net carbs for the whole bar 2 grams of protein ingredients unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter erythritol inulin dextran organic whole milk powder milk fat natural flavors stevia extract organic soy lecithin vanilla and sea salt ok this is the one like I said to get I've had several flavors of Lily's bar this is far and away my favorite I've done you know it's it's tough to find this sometimes the store that I go to near me for groceries a lot of the time doesn't even carry Lily's bars at all have to go to like my second you know choice grocery store and then even there they only have I think original almond crispy rice coconut I think that's it this guy I found at Whole Foods so delish okay half of the bar my entire carb allotment for the day so let's just break it right down the middle you go away those two sometime today cute chocolate hmm so good it's um it's freaking delicious it's tough for me not to eat you know the whole thing oh this is great you done its own I also have put this chopped it up and put it in Kiko pancakes put it in Pete yogurt Oh such a good combination I mean okay now the lilies barb he was no my appetite for caramelized and salted chocolate has not quick peaked today it's like 10:30 in the morning you can't go wrong okay so here's the deal I'm gonna stay very sedentary I'm just gonna saunter out into the next room watch my son play video games for a half an hour then I will be back here to prick my finger I'll test my ketones again just out of morbid curiosity they're already at 0.2 so kind of low and then the thing I really want to look for is that blood sugar number see what happens currently sitting at 83 we'll see you back here in a half an hour all right I'm back it's been about half an hour since I hammered that Lily's bar half of that Lily's bar time for prick number two okay brick number two ready here we go a little bead and we're gonna do blood-glucose first because I'm not too concerned with my ketones they're already pretty low 85 that's encouraging very much so barely any movement on my blood glucose all right let's check the ketones just for kicks I don't know what's gonna happen here it was 0.2 before no idea what's gonna happen here yeah nothing I'm gonna stop measuring my ketones this morning and I want to save these strips because they ain't cheap so from here on out we'll just do blood glucose so see you back here in half an hour all right we are now one hour postprandial as they say ouch this is one hour after Lily's 78th tell ya things are looking pretty good but I will be the last two blood sugar readings still have some warning hair and I'll see you back here in another half-hour okay we are now 90 minutes postprandial it's around noon here we go prick let's see what we get 80 all right we'll do one more just for kicks see you in a half an hour all right guys last one bed head is still strong at 12:30 p.m. proud you know what I might actually test my ketones one more time just last go-round 87 that's as high as it's been two hours later interesting just for kicks with my ketones one last time okay Wow interesting back up to 0.7 into nutritional ketosis who knows you know what I'll be back in a little while wrap this up I gotta go well I could take a shower okay there you go I promise one day soon I will figure out how to properly prick my finger consistently get a good bead I'm still noob you guys at the tender age of 44 I'm just now coming to grips and getting comfortable with drawing my own blood but here are the results as you can see right down here my blood glucose started at 83 got as high as 87 at the very end was as low as 78 so super happy with that eye blood glucose did next to nothing my cue tones on the other hand started at 0.2 low this morning and then dip down to undetectable on that second blood draw and so I just gave it up but then by the end said you know what let's see what we're at 0.7 back into nutritional ketosis at the end but I'm curious because I know that these particularly keto mojo and now there's another brand on the market that I'm forgetting the name of the I'm sure you're all screaming at your phones there's another one on the market and I know that the values that you get with the same drop of blood vary greatly between those two devices but interesting results nonetheless so I'm very happy to say that Lily's did nothing to my blood sugar really and I can continue to enjoy salted and caramelized the only flavor really worth pursuing that's not true really I like crispy rice I like the other ones as well it's just that salt and caramelized is oh so much better let me know what your favorite flavor of Lily's is and let me know if there are other products you would like me to try to test usually it happens on a Saturday morning and the bed head is in full effect you can also check out my buddy autumns Channel she's doing the blood glucose test I think she just did a bang energy a couple days ago she also has done chocolate perfection bar I think check her channel out it's awesome but when you do suggest items to me please if you can try to keep them two items that are fewer than 20 total carbs per serving this time trying to stay at I was over a little bit today cuz that half forgot half of a Luiz bar was 22 itself had a zip vis midday so I'm at 24 total head of steak for dinner so I kept everything as low as I possibly could don't want to go too nuts with the total carbs so that's gonna wrap it up for this video guys hope you enjoyed

COOKIES! tell them - what are we making? COOKIES! I'm using my binoculars does that help you? yeah we're going to be making Dark Chocolate White Chocolate chunk cookies. We like to call them tuxedo cookies because they're black and white let's get started. Hide! you're going to need 1/2 pound or 8 ounces of softened butter at room temperature 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of white sugar 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs at room temperature, 2/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa 2 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and about 2 1/2 cups of white chocolate chunks first, preheat the oven to 350\u00ba F then take your softened room temperature butter, and combine it with your brown sugar and white sugar and mix it well in the mixer until it's nice and combined. \"Whoa, look at it go\" you want it to be really nice and fluffy once the butter and sugar has combined and fluffed up, add in your eggs one at a time and mix until they're combined then, add in your vanilla extract and mix until that's combined finally, add in the cocoa and then mix it again. \"Can we lick it? Yes!\" \"It's yummy!\" now in a separate bowl, sift together your flour, baking soda, and salt take your flour mixture and combine it on low speed with the butter and cocoa mixture and mix it well! Now mix in your white chocolate chunks by hand to make your cookie dough \"It's gonna hide. Yeah\" So now we're going to take our cookie sheets and line them with parchment paper. Using our ice cream scoop we're going to scoop the dough onto the cookie sheet pop them into the oven for about 15 minutes until they're flattened They're going to look a little bit undercooked but then they'll firm up once you take them out of the oven \"Cookie is ready\" Let them cool for about 5 minutes, and then enjoy! \"cookoo cookie! I want one!\" and there you have it your chocolate white chocolate chunk cookies \"Super cookies\" we're going to dunk it in some milk \"do you like it?\" \"It didn't burn my tongue either!\" \"Oh it didn't burn your tongue either?

sweetness because we're not really used to that this is what we normally eat this one and this is just a 73 cocoa dark chocolate i have tried 90 before and that's still good so as a teenager i always eat milk chocolate as i've got older i've got the taste more for dark chocolate i just generally enjoy the flavor these ones we've been trying recently have other flavors in like this one's ginger orange and geranium lemon and coconut and cherry and so the flavor combinations of these ones it was lovely to try and they were beautiful my favorite is definitely the ginger one yeah the ginger one really nice fan of ginger and chocolate it just reminds me of christmas but anyway from montezuma's we brought this one this one is 100 cocoa it's called absolute black and it's got a flavor of mint in it it's literally 100 cocoa dark chocolate so let's just open it up and have a taste it does smell really minty which is amazing i'm hoping that the mint is actually going to add a little sort of sweetness to it this is the chocolate it's very very dark smells amazing it smells like after eights but next level right i don't know how much we should probably eat that should be enough i think oh that tastes really bad my eyes are actually watering oh it's like oh that is disgusting you can't even enjoy that with a couple no that's horrible did you taste the mint i didn't really get much of a mint vibe but i think that's because i've sprayed it with mint that's something else that is it's like salty isn't it there isn't any salt in it the aftertaste is really bad it's really really bitter it's like it burned your mouth a little bit how bitter it is that was nasty so that chocolate is definitely not suitable for eating i think i'd give it like a one out of ten yeah it doesn't taste good but i don't know if you're meant to even eat it like this it'd probably be good if he was baking or something he was making some sort of cake you might put sugar in yeah you might put a little bit of that chocolate in with sugar to make it edible but now let's finish it up with a little bit of yeah you like this one don't you oh it's a cherry one it's your favorite yeah i like that one um christmas even at summer if you want to try some delicious chocolate definitely check out montezuma's and go for one of their flavored ones they're really really really tasty if you live near a montezuma shop you're really lucky but if not you can always buy it online i think we'll save the 100 dark chocolate for baking or to prank guests yeah or maybe we could like get a little piece of this eat that and pass one of our guests a little bit of the really dark one anyway i hope you enjoyed this video thank you for watching", "Hh93XNkdjIA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] do [Music]

also one of the easiest pies ever so if you haven't had a lot of success making pies this could be a recipe all right so you're gonna need one pie shell you can use frozen no problem you could buy the pre-made rolled pie crust use that or we have videos on how to make pie crust so you could make your own dough if you want but regardless you need enough for one 9-inch pie crust alright for the filling we're going to start by beating two eggs with a wire whisk until they're kind of pale colored and sort of light and frothy you don't need to use any mechanical devices for this recipe just use a little elbow grease so I'm going to take you a couple minutes and when it looks like that we're going to add some milk some vanilla alright give that a stir we're going to then add some brown sugar some white sugar and mix that in so like I said earlier this is an incredibly simple simple technique there's really nothing that can go wrong here as soon as your sugar is mixed in like that you're going to pour in hot melted butter all right should be right from the microwave or if you used a small pan to melt it but it should be warm pour that in and whisk that together until it looks like that all right so our gooey sticky sugary base is complete and now for the star of the show the nuts we need to add pecans or if you prefer pecans so those are just roughly chopped you're simply going to stir those in and believe it or not your filling is done how easy was that come on alright for final assembly we're going to take some semi-sweet little mini chocolate chips and spread them on the bottom of our pie shell make sure you have some nice even distribution and then we're going to pour over the filling but you're going to be careful I want you to kind of pour it slowly going around like that if you pour it all violently like on one spot it might push the chips over to another section and then you know what happens someone gets a piece that has a lot chocolate someone gets a piece it doesn't have hardly any and then they start thinking there's some kind of conspiracy and before you know it people are crying okay so be careful with that make sure you pour it in nice and evenly give it the old tap a tappa not too hard a gentle tap a tap oh that's going to go into a preheated 400 degree oven for ten minutes you'll notice I put a pan underneath with foil case there's drips so 400 degrees for 10 minutes after the timer rings after 10 minutes turn it down to 350 and give it about another half-hour maybe 35 minutes it depends but basically the crust will be nice and golden brown the tops going to look like that and the filling is going to be basically set and not jiggly all right if you give it the old shake of shaken and it's jiggling let it go a little longer then of course you're gonna let this cool completely I think personally this should be served a cold but room temperature is great hot really doesn't work it'll just basically run all over the place and then there you go you guess the rest slice a piece put some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream in my case on top and dig in alright that beautiful sugary crusty top those rich sweet pecans or pecans all sitting on top of that gooey sticky filling so beautiful and that little bit of chocolate really does magical things I love regular pecan pie but when you add a little bit of semi-sweet chocolate you're talking about a whole other League of dessert awesomeness so I really hope you give this easy pie a try hey I rhymed head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts you

review on these enjoy life dark chocolate regular sized morsels basically there are dark chocolate chips I bought them at Whole Foods today they were on sale there either $2.99 or 399 I bought them because they're 69% cocoa their dark chocolate their Dairy nut and soy free they're also gluten free it says it's America's number-one allergy friendly baking chocolate so that looked interesting to me and then what really looked interesting to me is when I turn them around before I buy anything I always look at the ingredients and the ingredients on this item are unsweetened chocolate and cane sugar that's it this is such a pure and simple it's unsweetened chocolate and cane sugar to sweeten it and then a little bit of the description on the back of the package it says at enjoy life our whole business is making smile good foods that keep people's insights happy that's why all of our foods are specially made to be gluten free and free of the eight most common allergens our goal is to make delicious products that just about everyone can eat freely we promise they'll make you smile inside out so here's a little close-up of what they look like they just look like regular chocolate chips dark chocolate chips but the flavor is amazing they have the bitterness of dark chocolate but it's not too bitter because obviously there is cane sugar in it they're smooth they're not gritty and they're just really really good to me they remind me of eating a really good bar of fine dark chocolate and for a chocolate chip to have that kind of flavor I mean it's amazing because a lot of times I've bought like real expensive dark chocolate chips before and they're just horrible but these are really really good I would definitely recommend these chocolate chips if you're trying to stay vegan and avoid animal products they're also great if you're avoiding dairy or if you're allergic to it or if you're avoiding nuts or allergic to it or if you're avoiding soil you are allergic to it this is a really great product and I'm happy that I happened to come across it because I know I'm gonna be purchasing these again even if I don't use them for baking I love using little chocolate chips like when you get I know for me if I get like dark chocolate craving sometimes only need is like one or two little chocolate chips and then that satisfies the craving and then it's gone and I don't have to eat like a big bar of chocolate or anything this is a definitely healthy great option definitely check it out so that's my little review please give the video a thumbs up if it was

the rusty waters to be torn apart allow our land to be robbed I think that the greatest impact was probably left upon us versus us leaving it on them we walked into arenas that we thought that we would see a lot of poverty and depression where we actually learned that people are very happy in their environments and do it taught us to be very careful with what it is that we're trying to offer to a space that doesn't need our unhappy to come to them yes we are educating we are travel we will not cover before any man [Music]", "CRc-w11-CX0": "we are so excited to try the new Lily's products that we picked up while we were in the States a couple of weeks ago yes now we have tried their bars before like their blocks of chocolate yum with caramelized and salted is that what yeah that flame is probably my favorite they're all really good we didn't actually get any buzz this time though because they have new products that we wanted to try first up we have the chocolate coated almonds now these are really popular for us in at Christmas time we would love them pre kitto so we're so excited to have the option to try can you know chocolate coated almonds yes so they're sweetened with stevia and no added sugar this is what a serve looks like so it's 28 grams is that what it was roughly roughly and it's five net carbs for this one serve so let's give them a try okay although normally makes kind of shiny so it's a little bit different but I think that almonds must be roasted because they've got like a really nice flavor but yeah yeah that's delicious a large jump cut it not next up we have got the milk chocolate covered peanuts I mean come on Erica loves peanuts all not as big a fan of peanuts as erica bucks so that's a serve it was about 28 grams to one ounce and it's for Nick Cubs for its own weight this is one less than the almonds but let's try for me I think I prefer the almonds but is still really really cool they're really yummy I'm not gonna lie actually like the Diamonds more than I thought I would they and I'm putting them on powder at the moment so we also have got bed dark and milk chocolate peanut butter cups which I'm super excited to try now the serving is two cups right away he's very generous the dark was three grams of net and the milk was two grams of net so even if you just had one you know 101.5 so which one are we in traffic let's try the doc first so seven seventy percent okay one thing I don't like but I like double packaging seems unnecessary look pretty good that look like Reese's Peanut Butter Cup me very hot probably expected it to be soft when I'm being told hmmm it's a strong chocolate flavor but I'm not necessarily getting the flavor of the filling what do you think does not go to paint up I mean there's a lot of paint in them but no little peanut flavor it's not a spa no more ugly joint I was expecting delicious but if you're expecting it to be like a peanut butter erases peanut butter cup yeah I don't know probably because it's the dark chocolate it's quite overpowering and I mean it's yummy let's try the milk with I guess the good thing about them being single practice is that you could throw them in your work lunch or something like that that's kind of cool yet and once you've got the packet open it's not that sanitation is to keep going Bart it feels like you could just take one I think we're gonna I think is missing on the peanutbutter really not getting much peanut butter flavor I mean it tastes nice it's chocolatey and sweetened but I don't get the peanut I think I prefer the coated nuts no I think it isn't I don't know why we're not getting marks peanut butter flavor cuz I'm definitely a little feeling a really good ratio but but I don't like the texture of these like it's quite kind of crunchy on the outside yeah like that's it's not as better probably like a little bit disappointing I think maybe Erica build them up a little bit too hard in her own head they're still really good finally and like a million times better than having a Reese's one for you so out of the four what's your favorite oh gosh I think I'll go the milk chocolate covered peanuts they're really yummy and I love peanuts peanuts and chocolates just like a match made in heaven and they had like a nice crunch to them and really strong peanutty flavor I'm gonna go with the almonds because they kind of bring back Christmas for me it reminds me of what we used to indulge in a crisp at Christmas time so so that is all the new products from Lily's that we found in Whole Foods when we were in the u.s. now with Lily's chocolates I have bought the buzz before on I heard who shipped to Australia for free so that's an option I don't know if they're going to be stocking these products doing fingers crossed right is amazing really cool but yeah that's our thoughts on the Lily's new products if I could stop them by Christmas yeah that week man I'm happy if you liked

Giddens and I'm absolutely thrilled to be singing with the North Carolina Symphony this weekend we'll be performing a program that I put together with Grant Llewellyn and worked with Aaron grad to get orchestrated of three songs by will Marion cook one of the earliest black composers and when one of the first black composers to have his music performed on Broadway and it's a beautiful part of America's history that has not had the light of day shone on it nearly enough so it's great to be getting this music out there for people to hear we'll Marion cook is the original American Broadway voice as far as I'm concerned his music is lively and dancing and adventurous and jazzy and syncopated and all the things that I get excited about as an American composer Grant Llewellyn is a hero to me as a composer and a musician because he puts faith in me and a collaborative team and he gives us room to try out ideas and be bold and he gives the musicians time to properly rehearse and learn and chew on new types of music and it all in all it is just such a dream to have that kind of support because this is music that hasn't been heard with an orchestra in over 100 years and we have to find a new language it's a matter of taking what's on a page and bringing it to life the program this weekend is is really exciting it starts off with her speaky some mistral music of a different kind and then it moves into pieces that I'll be doing with the Carolina Chocolate Drops minstrel songs from our history in 1850s and I will be putting new lyrics to to that music and then there's also an original song of mine as well so showing the the differences and the commonalities between some of that music and then in the second half there will be the three orchestrations of the Ville Marion cook pieces and then the third afro-american symphony number one by William Grant still who is I think considered one of the first major African American composers of high classical music and so that was something that will Marion cook definitely aspired to but given the time that he was working in he chose a different path and so it's really nice having them side-by-side", "chTCbepvyFs": "hey guys emily from foodbox hq here today we're talking about hue kitchen so hugh kitchen's main principle is to get back to human and make sure that we stay away from processed foods in our snacking so let's check out what's in our box all right so inside the box while these are shelf stable snacks they do take out stabilizers from them a lot of what we have in here is chocolate they made sure that that was insulated so that it didn't melt this is our climacel temper pack i believe this can just be it's just paper so you can just recycle that alongside your cardboard just follow the instructions for the ice pack as well and then in here we have some snacking and baking dark chocolate gems so these are 70 cacao they are vegan and paleo with none of this stuff in them i think we have two bags of those and then we also have one smaller box in here and these are cashew butter and pure vanilla bean dark chocolate chocolate bars so let's get organized and talk a little bit about hue kitchen [Music] so the founders of hue kitchen were much like a lot of us including myself who try to eat healthy but they found that there were a lot of different things out there that didn't quite adhere to their strict rules they did some research about systemic inflammation as well as the gut brain connection and they saw that it all boiled down to artificial processed stuff that we're putting into our food the more we could focus on simpler better ingredients the better we're gonna feel and the more we're going to thrive so because of that they started hue kitchen and they have a bunch of different snacks that all follow those principles specifically they weren't able to find any chocolates that hit to that level so we're gonna taste test the chocolate that they created themselves so it is vegan it is gluten free it's dairy free it's got no cane sugar no refined sugars no sugar alcohols no palm oil no emulsifiers and no soy lecithin i'm so excited about this they're 70 cacao they're paleo as i said before they're vegan so it's gonna be a nice dark chocolate you can either bake with them or just snack on them we're just gonna snack on them today let's check them out so that's just a little cacao nib just like that definitely dark but it tastes like bacon chocolate like i don't know if you've ever bought that bar of baking chocolate and it's almost impossible to eat it's so hard what i like about this is it's a little bit smoother not quite as like really tough got a crunch to it but not so much that it hurts your teeth that's delicious one more all right so this is the get back to human cashew butter with pure vanilla bean dark chocolate again it is vegan it's paleo there's no palm oil refined sugar cane sugar sugar alcohols dairy emulsifier soy or vanilla extract on the back we can see that the whole bar is 360 calories which is not that bad and you know that it's all these really pure simple ingredients let's see what it tastes like i like this packaging as well break off a little square here goes nothing it melts in your mouth and so smooth it's not powdery like some dark chocolate you know when it's like overly cocoa or cacao rather it tastes like you're just ingesting the powder itself it has this really smooth creamy texture to it it almost like coats your taste buds that's delicious oh my goodness it's not the um consistency you'd expect you like expect it to be a lot harder but it's almost soft in a way that's really good all right i'm gonna go eat the rest of the bar don't tell anybody else and i'll see you in a little bit for some final thoughts wow all right so just a quick wrap-up on hue kitchen i am so impressed by this i love the idea of focusing more on simple ingredients i think all of the processed stuff that we've been eating our whole lives are definitely not contributing to our health but i think it's always going to be a good idea to make sure you're eating natural really good whole ingredients on top of that this chocolate was amazing full disclosure i am not a big dark chocolate eater i will go for milk chocolate almost any day dark chocolate i don't really love because it's usually overly bitter it's hard it's powdery this completely dispels all of that it was creamy the texture of that chocolate bar was like nothing i've ever had especially at that level of dark chocolate it still had the taste of chocolate to it this balance between all of those different flavors and the textures and all of that together just was so wonderful and it kind of shows you what chocolate is supposed to be like so if you want to try some awesome chocolate click the link below and check out hue kitchen you", "B7zoD5VpIL8": "I'm Justin Robinson I'm Rhiannon Giddens down Plemons variable question give a definition of the music you

little broken up bits of toffee this is a hard candy and some Chanel de sel which is an organic flour sea salt and our last thing we're going to need a chocolate mold this mold is a professional model however you can use a silicone mold or even little paper molds so let's get on with the recipe and for those interested each one of these little chocolate bars hold 100 grams of chocolate each so what I have here is tempered dark chocolate and it's very important to have this tempered and I do have a video on how to temper chocolate if you don't temper it the chocolate will melt very quickly in your hands so if you do have the time chapter your chocolate and you'll have a much better product you're going to get a nice chocolate bar that really snaps and is really really nice so I'm just going to start filling up my mold a little bit here when i tempered this chocolate just before I started the video however you can actually see that this chocolate is tempered so well that it's actually starting to thicken up on me so I need to get this moving if you do a really good job with tempering of your chocolate if you take some and put it on a little piece of paper it should start becoming hard and within three minutes and then I'm just going to tap this and get it into the corners it's perfect I'm going to grab my little toffee pieces in case you're wondering these are little score bits you can buy these in a bag a different grocery stores and also in bulk places so these are hard candy toffee tastes like toffee caramel so it's a hard candy so you're going to have a nice little crunch I'm good try to get this nice and even that looks good now that I have my table to set I'm just going to take a little bit of that and just sprinkle that all over make sure you get it nice and even that's good and then another coating of chocolate I'm just going to start getting this over the top and I'm going to take it and then I'm going to top just get it all even and now I'm going to pop this into the fridge for about ten minutes so I just brought this out of the fridge it's been in there about ten minutes I give it a little shake I can actually tell that I did a really good job at tempering because the chocolate bar is already released from the mold I'll just very gently flip this over and there is our beautiful chocolate bar all right so let's break into this and I want to show you what a nice crack we get with our beautiful tempered chocolate listen to this hear that snap that's exactly what you're looking for beautiful so a little closer up just to show you

Milwaukee blues and this is a tune here that was made popular by Charlie Poole won the great banjo players won the pioneers of bluegrass banjo and I had the great fortune of meeting a fellow by the name of Kenny roar who lives in Danville Virginia and he's the nephew to a fellow named Posey rorrer who played fiddle with Charlie Poole and so Kenny knows all the family history about Charlie Poole and such and I got the chance to sit down and play with him and this is one the tunes that really caught my ear one called Milwaukee blues this one's about hobos and trains and how those hobos always want to ride and so we'll do a little bit of this one for you", "WsHMD6__qEU": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some skinny dipped almonds I have the dark chocolate peppermint I have to start our cool crayon try the cocoa Fox because the peppermints any stronger these were 479 each and a place called red foods co-op we tried some skinny dipped almonds in the past different flavors so if you do a search for a Tami gun skinny dipped on my channel you will see them so these are dark chocolate cocoa less sugar more delicious gluten free PPO free almonds ethically sourced chocolate gluten-free no trans fat no artificial flavors or colors no paraffin and small-batch no paraffin and they come shiny one ounce 28 grams about 15 almonds is a hundred and fifty calories I figured that we would wait on to see does that one say it see okay month is one ounce 28 grams right so this one said 15 almonds that one didn't so I figured we would just see how many get 28 grams I lay down right there the deal with these is if you look at the picture they're saying they're skinny dip means there's a thinner coating out of the chocolate which this one's not as noticeable this one this picture like really crazy for our scale 28 grams it was 14 almonds was how many died so though they said 15 so that was good so this was the coating on the outside they're saying normal almonds are really thick chocolate pen and they're saying this one's a thinner coating so that's good hmm from the group yes their website is get or well it says more information get skinny-dipped calm Goku these are from Seattle Washington I like that I like the dark chocolates good so you can really taste the flavor of the almond through the dark chocolate sometimes we've had our troubles are so strong they would have overpower that almond completely and that's nice because you taste both both ingredients so this one is the noticeable powdery coating of peppermint so these with coke over 150 calories 415 these are gonna be a hundred seventy calories and they are white but they're still dark chocolate pepper around there we got a white powder coat right you get peppermint the menu later time mm-hmm let go they roll well that's very good mm-hmm they're very similar to the other ones and I'm glad they didn't put too much more peppermint because it could have go on to toothpaste yeah that if they put too much that definitely has that same flight yes yes and they're like honestly for me they're right on the edge I'm enjoying them but some of you would think that tastes like toothpaste it tastes like toothpaste more than candy cane so I don't want it so just know that these were are right on the edge but it's not too much for me it's it's just enough that that I'm still enjoying it but some of you would think it tastes two guys I like just the darker oh yeah the dirt chocolate are very good for all the time definitely a dark chocolate because you're not going to want peppermint all the time although I'll like them both if I was going to have one up in my cabinet all the time it would be the dark jungle oh yeah so I think these are good snot yeah and you get three and a half servings per packet so 479 sounds kind of pricey but if you do divide it out then you're getting your money's worth so I'll have a picture for at the end and thanks for watching [Music] [Music]", "23rjYgN3vuc": "- If you love brownies, then boy have I got the cookie for you! Say hello to my brownie cookie. Fudgy, delicious chocolate cookies that are beyond easy to make too. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cookies will be\nready before you know it. So let's get started. First off, let's melt one half of a cup or 113 grams of unsalted butter. And you want it nice and warm because we're gonna\nbloom the cocoa powder. Blooming cocoa powder is\njust gonna release more of the flavor and give you an\neven fudgier brownie cookie. So that's one half of a cup cocoa powder. And normally I would do this by hand, but today, it's a special\nday, I am using my hand mixer. I just got one. Well, Brian got me one. For the first time in years. I've broken several of them\nand I thought I was cursed. So let's see how this goes. So mix that in. We wanna have like a nice fudgy slurry. After that's mixed in, we're gonna add one tablespoon or 15 mL of warm or hot coffee, if you have it. In you go, carefully, please. Okay, mix that in. (upbeat music) Now we're gonna add in one egg and here's why I'm using\nthe electric mixer today. It's not just for the novelty. We wanna beat the egg, the butter and the sugars really well because if we play our cards right, we'll get that nice crackly brownie top, but let's see how it goes. Not making any promises, One egg. To the solution, I'm gonna\nadd one half of a cup of packed, light brown sugar. Alls of a sudden, this bowl's looking\ntoo small, just saying. Am I ambidextrous? No. And then one half of a cup\nor 100 grams of white sugar. Okay now, just mix and mix and mix. Okay, I was just having fun at that point. So smooth this all down here. I'm gonna set this aside. I've been completely tripping because this should've\nbeen a really big bowl. What was I thinking? Now we're gonna have a large bowl. I'm just gonna sift in\nthe flour and stuff. To my large bowl, I'm adding 80 grams or two thirds of a cup of\njust all-purpose flour. Really don't wanna use too\nmuch flour in this cookie. It is a fudgy, amazing\nbit of wonderfulness, which means there's not that much flour. Half a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of baking powder for a little bit of leavening. You don't have to sift\nthis up, but I cannot stop. Whisk it up. Done with the scale. So now you should be\nadding the dry to the wet, but doing the opposite doesn't\nmake much of a difference, by the way. Add the two mixtures together. I love brownie cookies because they give you the\nsemblance of portion control. If you make my brownie recipe, which is great, you can\nclick up here for that. You're eating like\nmassive pieces of brownie and you're like, I won't stop. Never gonna stop, which is great. But in a brownie cookie, you can just like have\na cookie, walk away, have another cookie, walk back. I'm gonna mix this until almost combined. That's almost combined. Now the last bit is to fold\nin the chocolate chips. I have half a cup of chocolate chips in, and I'm just gonna dump them in and use my spatula to fold them in. And while I do that, any last bits of flour that have not been incorporated\nwill be incorporated. If you do not like coffee, like, you're like, no coffee\nin my house, that's fine. You can totally skip that. Add a tablespoon of vanilla if you want or just like some water would be fine too. Okay, that's good. Look at this amazing mixture. Now we're gonna cover it\nup, chill for 30 minutes and when we come back, I'll show you how to scoop\nit out and bake it up. Once your dough's chilled, it's time to scoop it out and bake it up. So I like to use a\ntriggered ice cream scooper. It's really easy, but you can just use a spoon\nor whatever you'd like, and then you can give it a rough roll. Just roll-a, roll-a, roll-a,\nand it's ready to go. Tamp it down just a bit\ninto like a disc shape. You don't wanna have a huge ball because that inside will\ntake forever to bake. It's always nice to give cookies a little bit of room to breathe so don't crowd them out too much. My first batch is ready for the oven. That's a 350 for about eight minutes. They are not gonna be like\nfully baked and hardened. They will continue to set\nafter you take them out. You just wanna see that\nthey're like mostly baked. Into the oven you go. So ready to take a bite of this cookie. But before I do, if you like this recipe, check out my chocolate playlist,\ntons of chocolate videos, brownies, cakes, the works.

knows that the way to my heart is dark chocolate most of us know that chocolate is sacred but the problem is most people eat milk chocolate milk chocolate is evil it cannot be compared to dark chocolate has a lot more sugar and a lot less actual cocoa whereas dark chocolate is like Walter White's blue method the chocolate world but unlike meth you should totally eat dark chocolate for so many reasons my friend so many delicious reasons a new study coming out of Italy has found that dark chocolate can significantly improve our ability to walk particularly for older people who have peripheral artery disease this is a disease that slows down your blood flow not good two hours after eating 85% dark chocolate the participants were able to walk 11% further and 15 percent longer than their milk chocolate eating counterparts previous studies have found the flavonoids and dark chocolate stimulate the lining of your arteries to produce nitric oxide nitrous oxide relaxes the arteries and therefore slightly improves blood flow and slightly lowers blood pressure but it's not the only reason dark chocolate is all kinds of good for your heart scientists have found over and over that cocoa can drastically reduce the risk of heart disease in a 15 year study of elderly men a study in the archives of internal medicine found that regular cocoa consumption was connected to a 50% drop in heart disease 50% and another study published in clinical nutrition saw a 32 percent drop in calcified plaque in the arteries when participants ate dark chocolate twice a week another study in that journal found a 57 percent drop in heart disease when dark chocolate was consumed at least five times a week so basically with my current chocolate habit I am on the fast track to immortality you guys dark chocolate has also been found to raise good cholesterol and lower bad cholesterol improve cognitive function by increasing blood flow to the brain and reduce sun damage by increasing blood flow to your skin so as much as I wish this means you should eat dark chocolate for breakfast lunch and dinner moderation is still he dark chocolate is loaded with antioxidants like flavonoids polyphenols and catechins as well as lots of fiber iron and magnesium but it still has sugar and it can rack up the calories if you eat too much of it so when you're getting your fixed look for good quality organic dark chocolate that's 70% cocoa or above that's the good stuff or basically the highest that you can tolerate I found that my palate has slowly adjusted to the bitterness and by eating less sugar in general the really dark stuff around 85% tastes more sweet than it used to keep calm and dark chocolate on my friends and by the way if you haven't done it yet check out our new sister show

chocolate chips let's get started alright alright so what do we what do we do first for the pumpkin cookies okay the first thing we're going to do with these cookies is we're going to mix the shortening and sugar in this case to make it more healthy we're using butter so this is a half cup of butter and that goes in our large bowl and then we are adding one and a half cups unrefined sugar and Nathan since you have all the wonderful strength let's have you cream the sugar and shortening all very well while he's doing that I'm going to mix the dry ingredients the dry ingredients consists of two and a half cups of flour one teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of baking powder and there's a little tip that I have learned that if you have your baking powder or baking soda sitting for a while in your cupboard you want to probably shake up the box so that you're getting some of the baking powder and baking soda from the bottom so that it's still really good then we need a half teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon cumin Oh get out of those chips hahaha those are for late or saving for the cookies yeah we're making we're making cookies here you can H

with toasted pecans and a little something extra that I'm not gonna tell\nyou about til later. If you like my videos, hit\nthat like button and subscribe. Okay, let's get started. I'm adding two cups or 240\ngrams of all purpose flour into a small bowl. Just gonna weigh it out. Perfect. Now, two thirds of a cup of cocoa powder. I was gonna sift that out. Nevermind, it's okay. All right, half a teaspoon of salt. Three quarters of a\nteaspoon of baking powder. Ahem, I said. Now let's whisk it together. Carefully since I used\na bowl that's too small. (laughs) So chocolatey, so chocolatey. This is a chocolate lover's cookie. Okay, set that aside, including the scale. Now we're gonna cream our butter together. Into my stand mixer, I'm adding one cup or 226 grams of unsalted\nbutter at room temperature. In you go. No. (laughs) Look at me, trying to be a big shot. Okay, in you go, thank you. Close it up, cream it up. (beep) Plug it in, then cream it up. (beep) Cream that butter. Just cream it right up. Now we can add in one\nand a half cups of sugar. One. Two. This guy has to get polished. Let it beat until it's\nnice and light and fluffy. You will notice a difference. (upbeat instrumental music) Okay, I think you can tell, nice, creamy, fluffy, light. I'm gonna add two eggs in one at a time. And this recipe, if\nyou're making it at home, calls for two teaspoons\nof vanilla extract, but I have been baking all day, (laughs) I spilled my vanilla extract. There is enough left for this recipe, but instead I'm gonna use two teaspoons of orange blossom water because I think that orange, chocolate, great combination, I wanna give it a try. Always be adventurous in baking. If it makes sense. All right, one egg. Two eggs. Got it in. Now for the orange blossom water. This is so fragrant. I highly recommend it. Smells so good. Okay that is fluffed up to heck and back. I'm just going to, oh it's so cloudy on the inside. All this butter is so lightweight because all the air that got whipped in. Now it is time for that dry mixture. So we're gonna add this in\nwhile it's mixing on low. Stay in. Okay. Saved it. Kind of. Okay, here we go. This, yes. I really like the orange\nblossom water in here. You could leave it out if you want. And if you wanna go crazy,\ngrate some orange zest in here. Zest of an orange. You will be in orange chocolate heaven. Right now I'm adding a generous half cup of chopped\ntoasted pecans, my favorite. You could also use walnuts. You could also omit the nuts all together. Macadamia nuts, that's an option too. One cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. The never ending cup. And two cups of semi\nsweet chocolate chips. Get those all in there. Again, if you want them\nto be super chocolatey, use the full two cups. If you want more of the\ncookie, cut it in half. We're just gonna mix this up by hand. I wanna remind you to use a metal spatula when you do this because it\nwill snap the wooden ones. I've learned the hard way. (upbeat instrumental music) Get your exercise in there. I mean, unfortunately with food blogging and then the twins, this\nis all the exercise I get. Gone, gone are the Los Angeles\nfancy exercise classes. That's a memory. (sighs) Memories. All right, that's pretty good. Oh, this is cookie dough. This is delicious stuff. I'm not gonna eat it though. It's gonna onto a baking sheet and I will be using a Silpat. I'm using my trusty one and a half tablespoon ice cream scoop to get some nice consistent cookies. You could use whatever you'd like though. This is also the neatest way for me 'cause other wise my hands would be completely covered in cookie\nbatter, cookie dough, yeah. All right, on you go. (upbeat instrumental music) So full of chocolate and nuts. The nice thing about making\nyour own cookie dough too is that you can make a batch, put the rest in the fridge or the freezer, just make sure it's really well sealed, and have on demand fresh homemade cookies whenever you'd like. (upbeat instrumental music) These cookies are ready\nto go into the oven. However, let me show you a little, I don't know if it's a food blogger trick or just like a persnickety person trick, but if you want them to look\na little bit more perfect, just put a couple chocolate chips on top. You can imbed them in so it looks like it happened naturally. And that way when they bake, you'll have that nice\nglossy chocolate chip top and a little bit more chocolate. You can do the same\nthings for the pecans too. Just a couple little pieces\nof pecan here and there poking out, not covered\nby the cookie dough. They'll look really nice and show everyone exactly what's inside, besides butter and sugar. These'll bake at 350 Fahrenheit for about eight to 10 minutes. Just watch them spread. The edges will set. The inside'll be kinda gooey still, so let them set by cooling Don't lift them up. Out of the oven, just\ncool enough to handle and they smell so good. I didn't even eat any off camera. I waited for you. Okay, I'm gonna choose one of the cookies, put the rest away for later, and let's take a look inside. This is like chocolate fudge basically. You know I like a burnt\ncookie but for these guys, I don't mind them being\nlike so cakey and fudgey. (laughs) That's really good. There's so much chocolate in there. And the orange comes through in the last two thirds of the bite. Oh, that orange is nice. In fact, if you make this\nwith the orange blossom water, add some orange zest in too. You will be in chocolate orange heaven. Okay, thanks so much for watching. Hit that like button.

so you could stay back i'm leaving goodbye you", "nWbbDT8oPG8": "- Hey bakers, John Kanell\nfrom Preppy Kitchen here. And today we're making\na chocolate ganache. It all went in the bowl. (laughing) This silky, amazing combination\nof just two ingredients chocolate and almost any\nliquid you could want can make a perfect accompaniment\nfor chocolate eclairs, any kind of cake, donuts,\ntruffles, the works. This is gonna be really fun. Let's get started. So, to make this ganache I'm\ngonna use a one to one ratio of chocolate to cream, but you don't have to do that. If you want to make a\ndrip cake, for example, you would use, like three parts\nchocolate and one part cream of whatever liquid your choosing. We'll talk about the liquid\nsituation in a minute. But for now, let's get some chocolate. I'm gonna use a combination\nof semi-sweet and bittersweet. You could use milk chocolate. Anything you like,\nwhatever floats your boat. I often like to use all\nbittersweet chocolate because the ganache is\nlike a nice, not so sweet but very creamy finish\nto one of my desserts. Being generous with our cup. If you chop the chocolate finely, the ganache comes together really quick. You don't have to worry about any lumps hanging out here or there. You can make your ganache\nin a double boiler, just have a pot of simmering water with a glass bowl over it. The glass should not\nbe touching the water. Dump your chocolate and your cream and stir, stir, stir until\nit's almost all melted. Finish melting off heat because the residual\nheat and the chocolate will carry it through. The one concern you might\nhave is having chocolate burn and that happens when you\njust heat it up too high. So if you're microwaving use 50% power and if you're using stove heat, then go ahead and use a double boiler. (choppping with speed) I've done enough chopping. Let's transfer this over. Okay. Roughly one cup\nof chopped chocolate, now we're gonna add in\none cup of scalded cream. That just means the cream\nis just under boiling. So we're gonna pour it over our chocolate, begins melting instantly,\nso just give it a minute. Walk away. Do a dish or two. Look at my Instagram. Whatever you want. So it's been almost a minute. I couldn't really wait. I'm very impatient. Let's give it a whisk\nand see what happens. This is the fun part because\nit looks like garbage. Just whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk. And now we have a\nbeautiful, very silky liquid that we can use to soak cake layers in. You can dip donuts in this. Eclairs, just have it by\nthe spoonful, the works. If you want it to be thicker,\njust use less liquid. Start off with 1/4, and then you can add more as you go along. Let's try a version with coffee though, because a lot of people\nthink that you can use only like a cream to melt chocolate and anything else will make it\nseize, but this is not true, especially for a ganache. Once again just a little rough chop. (chopping with speed) I love using a chocolate\nganache on my cakes. You can click up here for my oreo cake. Oh my gosh, it is beyond indulgent and one of my most popular recipes. Gotta check it out. Transfer this to a bowl. Now a few tablespoons of hot coffee. I want to start off with two. Let it sit there for a few seconds. Just allow the heat from that coffee to permeate through the\nchocolate and give it an out. Okay. Let's take a look. Whisk, whisk. So here you can see that my\nchocolate is not fully melted. The coffee cooled down pretty quickly because we weren't using that much. So we're gonna zap this in the microwave at 50% power for maybe 10, 15 seconds. Yeah there's a microwave down there. It's a drawer microwave. K. Check that out. There we go. That's all we needed. Just fifteen seconds. I want to give these a little taste test and share the difference between\nthe cream and the coffee. Mmmmmmmm Chocolate. (tasting chocolate) Mmmmm This chocolate coffee ganache\nis perfect for my mocha cake. It's actually what I use to\nmake the ganache in that recipe. You can click up here for that. That is a chocolate coffee lover's dream. It's so indulgent and this ganache features\nprominently in it. So the coffee definitely comes through and you do taste it, but it's\na really nice combination. So if you love coffee\nand you love chocolate, try adding some coffee to your ganache. And you're not limited. You can add a splash of vanilla, a sprinkling of salt, whatever you want. Your ganache can take on\nso many different flavors. Just whisk them in, (whisking quickly) and... (tasting chocolate) you have a nice aromatic,\nlittle extra something that'll enhance your dessert. The consistency of that\nganache is great for dipping. So like for my chocolate\neclairs, dip it right in there. You can go a little bit\nthicker if you want, or let it cool down more and you'll get a thicker coat\nof chocolate from your dip. You can make a ganache with\nany liquid, even brandy. I made brandy chocolate truffles, and all they are is a very thick ganache and you're thinning it out with cream and an alcohol that you love. They're delicious and\njust really, really easy. You can click up here for\nthose brandy truffles. They are worth making every\nday of the week. (chuckles) If you make your ganache\nand it's too runny, you wanted to do some kind of a drip, or you needed a thicker glaze, but it's soupy even after it cools down, like if this is not right for you, don't worry. Go ahead and just add in more chocolate. So it's this one to one ratio, add in an extra of chocolate, give it a few seconds in\nthe microwave at low power, and now I have a much thicker glaze. This is gonna be perfect for a drip and maybe even a bit more\nsuitable for an eclair or any kind of pastry you\nwant to dip in chocolate. Silky and amazing, do you see that? I love it. You can out this ganache on anything. I just whipped up this\nbanana cream pie today, and you know, why not? A little bit of chocolate on top how 'bout them bananas? (chuckles) (eating pie) Good. All right, that was fun. So easy. I hope you get to make\nsome various ganaches especially try the one with brandy. That is good. And if like you thin it down\nenough it's basically soup, which counts as a meal. (chuckles) (bites strawberry) (chuckles) Messy. Mmmmm If you like this recipe,\ntry my chocolate eclairs. They are one of my all time favorites, and that ganache dip is everything. Thanks so much for watching.

you're going to love this next recipe and making homemade chocolate bars that can be made for any occasion and given to anyone any time of year as well as making a great gift for somebody now a great alternative to the fancy slabs of chocolate that you can buy in supermarkets first of all I'm going to be doing my feel-good chalk now this is dark chocolate the crystallized ginger dark chocolate when you use it at 75 to 80 percent and cocoa solids has been proven to lower the risk of heart disease and ginger is great for its restorative properties and it's some anti-inflammatory properties as well so it's a real good feel good chocolate go ahead and grab her up 200 grams of dark chocolate and break it into little pieces next chopped up a handful of crystallized ginger into small pieces and set it aside to make a slab of chocolate you'll need to line a bread tin with some baking parchment so there are two ways to melt chocolate the first is to do it in a glass bowl over a pan of boiling hot water you don't want the boiling water to touch the bottom of the bowl so if the saucepans too large use a ramekin to stand the glass bowl on add the dark chocolate to the glass bowl stir the chocolate with the wooden spoon slowly until most of its melted take the bowl off the heat and continue to stir until it's smooth and silky add two thirds of the chopped ginger to the chocolate give this a really good stir then pour this into your prepared to Britain move the tin around so the chocolate goes to all the corners sprinkle on the remaining ginger and the sugar that came with the crystallized ginger or just brown sugar is easy is that just look at the air bubbles and then we're going to put it in the fridge for about five minutes before we put the white chocolate on top the second way to melt chocolate is to do it in the microwave so to decorate the feel-good chalk I've taken about 50 grams of white chocolate popped it in the microwave for 50 seconds on a medium power when it's done take out the microwave and if you think there's still some large lumps that need melting pop it back in for a little longer maybe 10 seconds at a time so when it's smooth and runny you're good to go so five minutes is up let's see how it looks sits up half set ready for us to put the white chocolate on top so if you don't have special piping bags just take a normal sandwich bag and fill it with the melted white chocolate push the white chocolate down to one corner of the plastic bag and make a small cut then drizzle the chocolate width ways and length ways on the chocolate bar go back into the fridge for about five to ten minutes depending on the temperature of your fridge you want it to set but you don't look to bloom so don't leave it in too long but long enough so that it sets so when you take out it's not squishy one big chunk and it's really as easy as that now you've got a nice big slab of chocolate either to wrap up as a present for one person or you can cut it up into little bits and mix-and-match with you the chocolate you've made and give it to other people and I just want to eat it right now that won't cut the slab into triangles with a sharp knife you can find special sweet bags like this on the internet or did you sandwich bags if you don't have anything else and then just simply take your chocolate shards put them into the bag then give the bag little twist and secure it with one of the ties or sandwich bag tie to make sure it's airtight to make the bags look extra special and really cute i like to tie a bit of ribbon round the top and it really is as easy as that if you like this video then please just give me a little like I've really appreciate it and feel free to share with your friends and family as well maybe put a comment

season and there are different brands there's a Novation brand this hauler make 150 rooms in Terry's series chocolate orange that's a big name I want to show you if you've never bought one it's a good size and and yet you get 20 about 20 slices so what you do is you have to not get really really hard on the bottom it's gonna think about okay and then you should be able to pull the slices together easily pull them together sorry Wilma party pull them apart four pieces are 160 calories come apart little slices oh yeah and I'll take a picture but it's it's a really cool again and this is the toffee crunch what the dude any chair Oak Brook Terrace Illinois white yeah I'm good and that's a good topic but if you taste a little crunchy bits of toffee mmm that's delicious that's Royale did you make a distributed about the Ferrara candy having which they do a lot they're kosher yeah I love the flavor of Latin good chocolate toffee what we normally do because I guess if you had company these would go really fast but since we're normally trialed by ourselves we put them in a ziplock baggie and just keep them in the Ziploc baggie that way okay this is sea salt caramel and it's are they all 160 Cowboys the Dark One's Noah darkman's 200 in the under the dark ones 150 and then this one is the milk chocolate one just doing oh okay so the peppermint and these two are all hundred fifty galleries so the orange now one of all the orange ones would be in different power give that good compliment you know I wonder how different these would be their 90-day mm-hmm they really are the caramel that is incredibly sweet very I mean a lot of you would think that that was way yes you would say that to me I don't really get a soft flavor of them I got a little touch of soft towards the en bit it's mainly very very strong oh you like hard one you would like a liquid caramel too not like a hard call cheese and there is no pieces in that with the where they were like crunch pieces in the arms off in pieces there's no there's no texture in this one both of those they did a very good job with don't didn't have a plastic thing but it's a different box it's just a different style okay we bought one of these at a different okay it's CBS looks just weird that it had different balls because remember we went to Walgreens we went to Walgreens looking for these and they didn't happen so we went we went and CVS and we got this one orange at CVS and it was the same price 399 but then we ended up going in a different Walgreens and they had the rest of them so we so this is the milk chocolate orange and I've said it many times you all probably know I prefer my orange in milk chocolate oh I think we all do Andrew included if someone has told me that he likes orange in white chocolate and that they used to make a white chocolate and he wishes they would come back out of that I would love the opportunity to try orange and white chocolate I don't think I've ever had that if I if I have I been so long ago that I don't remember like a different year's super didn't know it's 2019 it's good till 2019 just a different box this weird well then it's weird because the other ones came with a plastic insert to hold the ball in place and they actually well know that was that the windows okay I was thinking there was a plastic enough but it's not so it just didn't have that insert button that's good that's nice puzzle orange very welcome very citrusy yeah but not part know our citrus into this I'd like everyone to do so yes in the milk chocolate and all of the existing

is he's only 150 calories of this so it's 1010 fewer calories the milk chocolate though like Kevin said earlier was 200 calories which I don't like that because I mean it's so good that good this most part good well you barely get it you barely captain I like to see that how there may be I would like say that to him Oh stuck the other like that how it's made I wonder think of how it's made episode always let us know because we like that show anyone that's good yeah really doesn't taste very adorable no it's not al Qaeda Texas really orange e but it's not a bitter dark I mean I get you once but

know what was coming it doesn't love me okay four pieces of this is 160 calories just like the first three and I don't I think we have had this immense somebody made a metro zone but it's been a little while immediately mm-hmm goat snap to the chocolate mm-hmm it's a nice meal you know a lot you all tell me that things would taste good frozen I bet you that we can't get frozen in trouble I

you may have noticed that when you buy chocolate chips at the store and when you hold them in your hand they don't melt very easily and there's a reason for that and the reason being is that all of the molecules are properly placed they're properly formed and this gives structure to the chocolate just like you see here as soon as you add a little bit of heat to your chocolate chips the molecules go crazy and they do this and now there is total chaos all of the chocolate chips don't know what they're doing all of the molecules inside are very confused and they act like this there is no rule there is nothing that's uniform everything is in total chaos so when you go and try to chill your chocolate you'll notice that it never comes back exactly the way you wanted it to it doesn't get that perfect structure it doesn't get all of those lines all of the chocolate is still in chaos so there's a simple way to fix this and it's by adding in brand new chocolate which still has structured all of these chocolates here the molecules inside don't know what to do and they're looking for somebody to teach them to put them back into order so by introducing new chocolate which has never been melted it actually teaches the molecules and these in these chocolates to actually start going back into line like this and that is a really simple way of thinking about how chocolate is tempered and I'm going to show you that in the next step what I have here is two cups of chocolate chips I'm using semi-sweet chocolate chips here today but this works with milk chocolate or dark chocolate as well so I've got one cup here one cup here I'm going to microwave this bowl here the one cup I'm gonna microwave this on defrost until it's melted and then I'll be back okay I am back and I am microwave to my chocolate on the defrost mode and it is nice and melted now now this is very very warm at this point I'm going to take this chocolate and pour it into here now remember when I was saying in the opening sequence all of the molecules that are in this chocolate now they don't know what they're doing okay they need some kind of instruction or a teacher and this chocolate here with the with the molecules that are still good these molecules are going to teach the molecules in that chocolate so I'm going to take some of this chocolate I'm gonna get it in there and then I'm gonna keep mixing and I want to get most of that chocolate melted so the unmelted chocolate chips are going to teach the melted chocolate what to do and this is going to call and this is what we call tempering so it's going to temper our chocolate so when it cools it's actually going to get firm and it's going to be really nice like it used to be if you melted all of the chocolate together all of this chocolate together you would not be able to temper this chocolate you would have to actually add more chocolate to the mix you can see this is slowly melting so I'm just gonna keep going at this until it's really melted down if I see that this melts completely then I can add a little bit more you want to stop adding chocolate chips to the melted chocolate when you see that the melted chocolate is not absorbing any more of the chocolate so you want to get all this going and just keep stirring and if you find that it is getting a little bit cold you can take the heat of your hand and just get it underneath and keep going at that and it'll eventually all melt in so I'm going to keep doing this and I'll be back in a minute or two okay and at this point most of that chocolate has melted in there I can see that it is really incorporated all of that extra chocolate chips so I can take a few more and just drop them in you don't want to put too many in you just want to get to the point where they really don't melt anymore and from experience I kind of know that's gonna be about it now what happens if you had dumped all those in and hardly any of them melted that means your chocolate wasn't very hot to begin with you can take the whole thing put it into the microwave and only put it on the defrost for about 10 seconds because you don't want to completely melt all of the little pieces that are still in there because if you do then you're gonna have to add even more chocolate in there to temper it so you can see that there's still some in here and those are probably not going to melt a hundred percent however there is enough new chocolate in there the teacher chocolate that are teaching those students that this year is going to be tempered and that looks really really good and that's how easy it is to temper chocolate and this works with any type of chocolate this is how you do it simply at home so I hope you enjoyed this video I hope I explained it well enough so I don't know if I did hopefully I did a good job so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you next time you", "B1y4w8ZJELc": "all right what I've got here I call these super chocolate brownies with white chocolate nuggets because those in there those little nuggets of white chocolate say you've just got this is super chocolaty mmm look buy any of that oh just flavor and gooey chocolate in there from the melted chocolate nuggets a lot of butter is used in it so it's really buttery and delicious mmm just about like caramelized it's so good let's go to the kitchen and bake up a batch right now [Music] now to make our super chocolate brownies with white chocolate nuggets cure the ingredients what we've got here first a little bit chocolate so there's six ounces or 170 grams of dark chocolate which I broke it into pieces that could be anywhere between half inch quarter inch so five millimeters to 12 millimeters and the same goes to the white chocolate again that's also 6 ounces 170 grams broken into pieces three eggs three quarters of a cup of flour 3/4 cups of a butter 1/2 cup of the Demerara brown sugar that's that really you know kind of sticky molasses a brown sugar and a half a cup of regular sugar or in my case I like to use the cane sugar and then we've got 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of salt so first thing we're gonna do is melt the butter in a small pan and what we're using here is I'm using a smaller element or the smaller burner because it burns at a lower flame I'm gonna keep this as low as possible don't want to burn that chocolate so first let's melt that butter keeping out a very low flame and it was gonna wait for the butter to melt first then we're gonna add in the dark chocolate and the two sugars so let's be back right back once that butter is melted all right the butter has melted I've got the flame on its lowest possible setting in go the two sugars so he goes the regular sugar in goes the Demerara sugar gonna give that a little stir around in there that's slowly dissolving into the butter oh hey somebody escaped all right so that's dissolving now in goes the dark chocolate and it's the white chocolates not going in that stays unmelted because oops we want to have then there's nuggets so now here low flame this is really good if you can do it a double boiler is even safer that you don't burn the chocolate but I actually have a double boiler and I'm not using it I like to just do it in here just give it a just keep stirring it make sure it doesn't get to sit on top of the flame you know that's always moving around until you just see the talkin is melted alright that chocolate is melted so off goes the flame now we do get a medium sized bowl crack the eggs into it what we do is we're gonna whisk those eggs first take the whisk whisk up the eggs in goes the salt in goes the vanilla give that a little whisk and now all I'm gonna do you just mix that into the chocolate so in goes that egg side mix that in so make sure it's well combined before we add in the flour alright that's looking good and now even that pan will cooled off enough I can put on my counter here so these things out of the way now in goes the flour now with a flower I want to mix it gently just until it's combined you just want to get the flower combined you don't want to whip it beat it just kind of combine it in there until the flour is mixed in basically what you're doing here is gently gently folding it in once you see the flour mixed in like this that is good to go so now this is cooled down a bit yeah so it's not gonna melt our Nuggets right away so in go the white chocolate Nuggets mix those just enough to combine them in there get them all distributed throughout the brownie dough brownie batter mmm that's good all right so what I've done here is I've prepared a baking pan a nine by nine baking pan first I've done is rub butter all around it everywhere and then I laid it in some cooking paper just across one way doesn't matter these two sides I'm not worried about that meaning I'm worried about the bottom more than anything else have label to put a cooking paper that buttered it a little bit notice I've left it sticking out a little bit on either side now cuz that makes it so easy just to pull the brownies out of there all right so let's pour the brownie batter into here and then I'm gonna spread it out and there we go that's ready to go in the oven now that oven is over there it's just well heated up and ready it's at 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius and this is going to go in for 35 to 40 minutes we're gonna check it afters at the 35 minute mark I'll be back here we're gonna check it see if it's done all right see you in 35 minutes [Music] all right so that's been cooking for 35 minutes and as you can see it's got some pitting in the top so it looks like it's baked should be ready we're gonna give it the skewer test anyways so let's go get in an angle oh yeah that feels it's coming out clean just little crumbs that is done perfect so go let it sit here and cool and you see there's still some butter and the butter is gonna slowly absorbed back into the brownies the butter that was kind of bubbling down the sides here let that cool and in about 10-15 minutes it should be ready I could just lift it out and plop it onto a cooling rack all right enjoy those they are absolutely delicious now if you go to the link appearing on the screen you can get the free printable recipe for a super eat chocolate brownies with white

right around the corner many of us will be making homemade treats and baked goods to share with friends and family and what better gift to give then chocolate now tonight we'll be showing how to prepare our dark chocolate superfood bark now as you can see I have a very special guest here with me in the kitchen this is Ellie Ellie do you want to say hi to everyone hi now Ellie falltime is my absolute favorite time of the year do you like fall time I love it what do you like to do in the fall I like to go to fairs time with family and friends family and friends that's super important isn't it especially around the holidays many of us will be going to parties now have you ever made a dark chocolate bark before no I haven't it's super simple do you want to go ahead and dig in and I'll show you step by step how we put this together all right now you said you like chocolate you said you like dark chocolate I'm gonna give you this big pour of dark chocolate now are you gonna help me pour this into the tray yes all right so what we're gonna do is you're gonna hold it up high and this is a dark chocolate that's about 80% cocoa now the darker the chocolate the healthier it is for you did you know that no so you want to look for a dark chocolate that's at least 70 to 85 percent and again this is about an 80 percent cocoa count now we're using about two bags of our chocolate chips and you're gonna pour this directly onto some parchment paper on a baking sheet now I'm gonna have you set this to the side for me now we're gonna take a spatula and we are gonna spread this around now if you don't mind grab the corners of this parchment paper to hold it in place now it's very important to keep your chocolate shell pretty thick about a quarter of an inch because you have to remember chocolate melts doesn't it so we want to make sure that it's a little thick so it doesn't melt as easily because we want to make sure that we can put this out at our party and folks could eat on it all throughout the party there okay okay once you spread it with our spatula next we are gonna add a little bit of white chocolate now do you like white chocolate yes I do do you have a now have you ever mixed white chocolate with dark chocolate before no I hadn't so it's very simple so as you can see we each have a spoon here so go ahead and grab your spoon and earlier we melted some white chocolate and our dark chocolate and we're gonna give this a nice little stir now to melt your chocolate a lot of folks think you need a double broiler you can actually use a crock pot just put it on the low setting or the warm setting and let it melt at a very slow pace and this is how we got this nice creamy consistency now you're gonna stick your spoon in and you're gonna get a nice spoonful there and see how it's drizzling off into the cup that's what we want to happen over our chocolate okay you ready so we are going to dip it in and we'll do a little drizzle now this recipe is great for kids to help in the kitchen with and you can do all sorts of patterns and designs and here we're making one large piece of bark you can also pour it use a ladle import into small circles so you can make bite-sized pieces or you can even pour it inside of cookie cutters for fun shapes like stars and hearts so the possibilities are endless now look how pretty that is isn't that pretty cool yes all right now are you ready to add some toppings uh-huh all right now the first topping we have our almonds do you like almonds yes all right we'll put our spoon down there on the side so we have some almonds now notice these aren't whole almonds are they these are sliced almonds so we're gonna take a little pinch and really with your superfood bark you are going to sprinkle all over and the possibilities are endless when it comes to your toppings you could pretty much use anything that you'd like now we have a lot more toppings so next we're gonna switch over do you know what these are these are pumpkin seeds also known as pepitas can you say pepitas the Pete cookie does there you go and these are raw and organic that's why they're green now for Halloween do you usually carve pumpkins yes you can actually save your seeds you know how you get all those seeds and scoop them onto your pumpkin you can save them rinse them off and clean them and you can even bake them in the oven now here we have some chopped pecans I love pecans and these come chopped already in the bag so you don't even have to chop them up which makes it pretty easy right now notice how we're taking the toppings all the way to the edge here yeah now next we tried some of these earlier didn't we these are crunchy chocolate bites that we have at Earth Fair and chocolate on top of chocolate it doesn't get better than that does it so we're sprinkling just a little bit of our chocolate yes followed by goji berries now have you ever had goji berries before yeah I have goji berries are considered to be a superfood they are packed with antioxidants and vitamins and minerals and they help to give us natural energy so all we have to do is go here to all the way to the salt you got it we're working our way around with the topic what type of salt is it we have Himalayan pink salt and I'm actually glad you asked that the reason why we add a little bit of salt to the chocolate is to balance out the flavor it's all about balance now here we have dried blueberries blueberries are great to use instead of maybe your traditional raisin these kind of look like raisins they do they kind of look like raisins but they're actually blueberries again blueberries are packed with antioxidants and vitamins and minerals now what do you think we have here do you want to take a guess pineapple pineapple you got it this is dried pineapple now the sweetness from the dried fruits they're gonna add a bit of a sweetness and a chewiness to the chocolate remember how we talked about balance a few seconds ago it's all about balance with our bark now here we have papaya have you ever had papaya no I siliceous do you want to try a little piece real quick sure I'll try one with you here let's try a piece nice and sweet do you think that's gonna add a chewiness to our to our bark it's pretty good isn't it now the sesame seeds again add a nice crunch and you can add a couple of tablespoons and for your toppings no matter what you use you need about 1/4 of a cup or so now last but not least we have one more topping and again it's our pink Himalayan salt so now at this point in time we are going to place our chocolate bark in the freezer we're gonna freeze for about 15 to 20 minutes till it's a nice solid piece of bark and then when it comes out we'll show everyone at home how to break it up into little pieces and we'll even taste it how about that okay all right let's go ahead and put it in the freezer let's go [Music] so Ellie I think it's been about 15 or 20 minutes do you think it's time to pull it out of the freezer I think it is let's go check it out all right let's go ahead and head to the freezer and it looks beautiful you did such an amazing job look at this you you mean we did amazing job that's right thank you we did an awesome job now a great way to tell if your chocolate bark is ready you can cut it press the side does it feel solid and nice and frozen to you yes yep if it breaks off like this we are ready to go now here's the fun part there's a couple different ways that you can do this at home I like doing it with my hand because we have control of but over how big the pieces are so we're gonna take a piece of parchment paper which is what we put our chocolate bar on we're gonna lay it right on top just like that okay now we're gonna take the heel of her hand this part right here okay and on this side I want you to pick up the paper here just a little bit just like this so your hands underneath good job put your hand right underneath there you go right under the paper do you feel how cold that is oh yeah the heel of your hand I'm going to press down and snap it just like this and we'll get nice big chunks perfect and that way the chunks won't be so small and they break away just like this and these make great gifts you can actually put them into wax paper bags and it's like three or four that one's huge absolutely and we can keep it like that or we can even break it up if we'd like but they make great gifts you can take them to parties again share with friends and family and I think these look amazing yeah I think it's time for us to try one of these I think you're right too but before we dig in I want to make sure everyone at home has the recipe so you can visit earth CARICOM just click on the recipe link at the top of the page there you can search for dark chocolate superfood bark again that's earther calm just simply click on that recipe page and we have a ton of other great recipes that you're sure to love so I think it's time to dig in how about chocolate Cheers yes there we go Cheers mmm okay really good that is saltiness the chewiness the sweetness it balances all out don't know hmm until next time guys happy cooking thanks for joining us and you can't keep the salt mm-hmm it's perfect mm-hmm [Music] you you", "7MwjSUdcFI0": "hello my name is Beverly Dinkley I'm head of the UK chocolate Academy in Banbury and today I'm going to teach you the easiest way to temper chocolate which is using a microwave oven before I do that I just like to talk to you a bit about the make up of chocolate and within chocolate we've got a very special fat called cocoa butter and when we're tempering the chocolate was set in the butter in a very stable crystal core beta 5 the setting temperature of that stable crystal is 34 degrees so when you buy your chocolate it is in fact already tempered so when we are tempering in the microwave all you've got to do is remember not to take this whole chocolate above 34 degrees you'll keep the chocolate in the stable crystal that it was formed in and you'll have perfect products with a nice snap gloss and contraction so I'm just going to place some chocolate into a plastic bowl it's a good idea to plastic a lot of people use glass but glass can actually retain the heat it can heat the chocolate up when you've actually finished your tempering and then if you take your cupboard of degrees higher which means then you've taken it out of temper today I'm using the calibre 8 to 3 chocolate but the method we're going to do right now in the microwave you could do exactly the same with the 811 plain chocolate or the W 2 white chocolate so I'm going to place this chocolate now in the microwave for one minute on full power the microwave I'm using is a domestic microwave and with a wattage of 1000 so we can see after one minute the chocolate doesn't look like it's moved or melted at all but if I can actually see you can see a tiny bit of chocolate is melted at the very bottom but if I actually pick up a button from the outer ball can you see it doesn't look like it's melted but it actually has melted so therefore if I continue to just put this in the microwave it is it's going to heat up and getting very intense in the center and the chocolate could actually burn so even though the chocolate looks solid they've actually melted so I'm now going to stir the chocolate I feel a bit of an extra smell to chop on the edge there just to dissipate the heat the chocolate is still pretty firm so I'm going to place it in the microwave now for another short burst about probably 10 or 15 seconds so it's very short burst but remember what I'm thinking all the time is I've got to melt the chocolate and not take it above this 34 degrees so again you can see now the chocolate is actually making more of a paste so I'm going to place that in again for another short burst so again about another ten seconds you can see now the chocolate is getting more relaxed and we're starting to get physical melted chocolate but then again I've still got the chocolates more of a paste and it needs more melting down so when you first do the chocolate tempering in the microwave the first color of times you'll need to do a time test to see how long that the microwave takes to actually melt the chocolate below 34 degrees once you've got that time test then every time in the same bowl with the same amount it will work always at that temperature to be finished so I'm just going to place it in now see it's more of a smooth paste I'm just going to put that in for another short bursts so another shot burst maybe only 5 10 or 15 seconds and you can see now the chalk is much more liquid and you can see we do still have some buttons that haven't totally melted so this is a time when I wouldn't put the chocolate back in the microwave too readily I'm just going to literally stir and melt those existing buttons in the heat of the chocolate that's already in the bowl so after some initial stirring if you feel that the buttons are not going to break down then we just need to get a tiny tiny one last short bursts so this time literally a few seconds now obviously everybody does it now and again we are going to heat the chocolate above 34 degrees but it's very very easy to rectify and all you need to do remember you've already got tempered chocolate the beta crystal in the buttons on the bag you just add a few more buttons and stir them in gently they'll cool down the chocolate taking your blue 34 and they'll be seeding in some more of that very precious beta 5 crystal so I'm very happy now my chocolates lovely and smooth it's a nice consistency I've got no solid buttons in there so my next task is to test the chocolate to make sure it sets which give me an indication that I do have beta 5 crystal within the chocolate so I'm just going to put a test of chocolate on a piece of paper just grief real silicon and what I'm wanting ideally is for the chocolate is on set on the paper in two to three minutes if the chocolate and it takes longer than two to three minutes to set it's an indication I have melted away all this very precious beta 5 crystal and that's when I need to add a bit more stir them in to actually see it in some more crystal so two to three minutes have passed you can see that the chocolate is set on the paper it's got a sheen you're never going to get a completely high Sheen just by test on the paper that'll be if you're using a polycarbonate mold form nobody figures or doing acetate for decoration but we're happy there's no lines there it's worth few lines then the chopper will probably a little bit hot so you just said it cool for a few minutes and then it will be perfect if you do an additional test if the chocolates hasn't set after two to three minutes then you will need to add some additional tempered buttons just stir them in to your main mass of chocolate allow them to cool down the chocolate and to seed in some beta 5 crystals so we're happy now and we can make some nice products for the bakery you", "z3Z02rjx15w": "today Karen and I are gonna be trying some cacao therapy I have chocolate covered almonds dark chocolate covered almonds and dark chocolate expressively so let me say I think these were 399 each a home units it says cacao therapy no chocolate-covered almonds are a perfectly simple little pleasure made with smooth milk chocolate and natural almonds they are the perfect snack pick up a bag today life's too short not to treat yourself well that is the truth they're made in Torrance California WWWF cacao there become non GMO kosher let's see five servings in a container 40 grams is to 20 hours so if you really care about the calories you have to weigh on oh these are big these are much bigger than I thought that's the chicken there's almost a small room yes they're big so this is just a milk chocolate it's pretty thick cutting [Music] you know they do a scam on chocolate sugar and those are more like triple dipped hmm we just think we've tried at home and recently that its whole selling point that it was then yeah it didn't have all the chocolate on the outside those like those other people use too much chocolate we need to see that thin coating yeah it's the only well their whole thing is to give you the almond and a hint of the flavor Brook to make you feel like you're getting a dessert without all the calories this is indulgence this is a hey we're gonna give you this is life is short maybe it Y you can eat it because once you're once you're gone you're gonna let it you can it have any more yeah I like this a lot there's been like I said a very very thick layer you can still taste the almond them all right so it'll be interesting on this dark chocolate yeah are you gonna still be able to taste the almond as well in the dark so Kevin open this I should have made no finish it okay these are definitely no no they door oh yeah don't get your views about that these are 210 calories 440 grams so 222 10 that's again there's really more of eating just a soft piece of dark chocolate did you do a sock how softer than some of our problems next motion on carbs like Oh God really didn't snap shut these are it's a song not between the train oh yes definitely yes there's a there's a definite texture difference milk chocolate was it wasn't soft but it was softer divided into this was a crisper outer edge and but you can't they see on our lease I didn't know I got the texture available no really the dark chocolate covered up that might come out but I do like that yeah I like that a lot so I could eat that entire body even though it's dark chocolate and I'm not normally a dark chocolate person I can eat down these are the dark chocolate espresso things and these are 30 grams so this is completely different 30 grams is a hitter of 50 calories but they're smaller so you can tell the difference in the between them it says are you having a tough day had to drive yourself out of bed need a jolt we have the solution account therapy dark chocolate covered espresso beans we took roasted coffee beans and coated them with a delicious layer of rich dark chocolate if these don't get you going you should see your doctor mmm smells good they're strong there's no dark chocolate

of the texture of Kevin never likes that yeah the the crunchy and I do it's not something to be honest I could not eat a whole Bible because I think it would make my stomach hurt but I like them a lot

wrong they did a very good job they're good at what they are they're very yeah yeah I just never liked the texture though well I think these are all very very nice dawnie I don't know if they make

yeah let me trauma these so yeah what so what was your favorite and it's just the milk chocolate yeah only dark chocolate was good if you really really liked our chocolate but they make kind of yeah some kind of heat suburbicon the almond didn't they right because that's why I like the milk chocolate the best as well I like the dark chocolate I like the espresso things but you can really taste

things together ok so we've preheated the oven to 350 degrees ok and then in a large bowl we're going to mix our wet ingredients which is 1 tablespoon of oil okay we have three eggs right here we're gonna score those in we have 1 15 ounce can of pumpkin puree she kind of looks like baby food but tastes good yes baby good night too I don't remember it's been a long time it was a baby once these wet ingredients are mixed together in a separate Bowl we're going to do our dry ingredients so we have flour baking powder we have nutmeg ground cinnamon allspice those are the spices that really make it fall in yummy and salt and brown sugar so all these are going to be in a separate Bowl we have wet in this ball dry in this ball now who taught you to cook a little bit of both my mom always made chocolate chip cookies we never really got more intense or different than that but my sister kind of got me into cooking a little bit and then when she stopped I just kind of took over the reins and I found recipes on pinterest I really enjoyed baking anything that was yummy and I love baking desserts that's my favorite thing yeah so I always bake something and then I leave some for my family we try it and then I box them up and I send them out to people put them on the neighbor's door stats take them to school things like that that is so sweet okay so we're just gonna mix these things together yes and then we'll have these together in a different Bowl and we're gonna put it all in our dish put them in the oven so we'll let you keep mixing now something that you're doing right now

Catherine and welcome to the first episode of dark chocolate or views where we will be talking all things dark chocolate pure unadulterated choc chocolate without sea salt or pretzels or potato chips much as delicious as that stuff is I'm going for the purest kind of angle right now okay so today the very first one we'll be doing is one that pretty much found every anywhere I think by okay I looked this up and I heard two different ways to pronounce this I heard lint and spring Li but island in spring Li but I mean this is the official name of the company lint excellence 85 percent cocoa extra dark this has a full-bodied cocoa flavor now as you can see here it has like a nice thick cardboard coating on the back on the back is a little bit about Linda's masters chocolatiers this is vegan if you're into that kind of thing well most of the dark chocolate I will be reviewing on here is vegan it talks about how it's 85% cocoa it's also wonderful now it does not stand here where the cocoa beans are sourced I had to look that up online and apparently this company gets all like their cocoa beans from Ghana so are you ready let's try this okay so this will show you well first off there is a man having a staring contest with the chocolate it comes telling you what to tells you to tear off corner pull end out so let's do that okay so then we have silver inner lining so box going that's all nice and folded you do need to tear it though so we're gonna tear it okay let's look okay so there's nice I don't know what is that it's like at least an inch so there's you have it inch long squares the texture is smooth the on the darker note of things I don't sense any fruity whining wine II miss at the moment let's see how how it breaks breaks off pretty easily holds over its gonna put it back in this cardboard okay so how's a decent snap yeah let's draw this together shall we soft smooth creamy it reminds me a lot of like a dark Italian roast so not really I need fruit notes to this the melt is smooth and almost immediate like it's not that hot out right now but I can feel it I mean no no it's on my fingers but I can feel it starting to starting to get soft and melt let's start yeah start now I don't you can see that starting to come off it's just very they're like not super in you're like no the flavors are super in-your-face just start off like a compa light Italian hello everything is very on the down-low nothing there there aren't really any bright notes not even that like to you to borrow a term from coffee wine tea it's not not not very big there's not not a lot of tannins not all our brightness not a lot of acidity very just very middling very low-key very calm very like I'm chocolate I'm here nothing really going on with my day nothing bad nothing good just chillin so yeah well that was the first dark chocolate review thank you so much for viewing um I do have below if you're interested I'll probably be doing this once a week is what I'm thinking um please just please subscribe and in the link below I have one or two links to other YouTube channels that I really enjoy I hope you have a great week you are handsome and you're beautiful no matter how you look or feel goodbye", "bnF389LoTI4": "okay so you want to make chocolate the permutations are almost endless but you've got to start someplace so what I'm going to recommend to you for your first batch and usually often your first bean if you are undecided where to go is to do the same thing I do with every evaluation chocolate I make I make a 75% dark chocolate it's not super dark it's not super light it's it shows off the chocolate well and it gives you a springboard of where to go with that you can you know make a little darker little lighter your choices but it's good it's a good springboard so if you've been following along we have roasted a set of beans we've cracked and winnowed them so the next is to weigh this out I am I guess I'm retired chemist I've been in the lab for 20 odd years as far as spoken languages go I'm not bilingual but I am metric bilingual if you want to call it that way or metric fluent so and I like working that way it just makes life easy especially in this stuff and you'll see why I hope we're going to make a kilogram of chocolate what that means is a thousand grams and what it means also is the calculations are really simple so when I say we're going to make a 75% chocolate there's no standards on this but it's reasonably well accepted what it means is the percentage comes up to the amount of cocoa mass or nibs you have and the amount of cocoa butter the combination of those is the percentage percentage of chocolate so in this case we've got 70% cocoa nib 5% cocoa butter so right there you know and it right this time it's saying 705 not a big deal cocoa butter 55 again this thing only has a discrimination of 5 grams I pre weight it it's where it is the combination hopefully we're right at 75 there we are and this is just to give you an idea what these look like and then comparably the remainder is 25% sugar 250 grams yeah it's all it's all now wanting to weigh high that's ok that's actually a really good point to make that's half a percent of difference if it's even real value you'll never taste the difference you know get get down to you know just a little bit it's fine so that's what those look like that's going to be your first batch of chocolate a 70% cocoa 5% cocoa butter and 25% sugar after this we're going to or to get this going we will melt or cocoa butter add it to heat of Milan sure we're going to warm our nibs slightly and start adding those to the Milan sure once that is flowing smoothly will then start incorporating in the sugar that will then run for you know I tend tend to say you know run it for a day you know start it at one point the day when you get free time pull it off the next day it's going to be fine you know I give a big window you know with you read a lot of what's on the site that's you know anywhere from you know 12 hours to 36 hours to 72 hours or 96 hours it's going to be smooth enough at 24 it's going to taste good at 24 you then get to decide if you know what you want past that taste it taste it along the way this every step watch how it changes it's a real transformation I mean that's what this is about I mean it's chocolate alchemy alchemy is the you know transmutation of a base substance you know base substance beans to a higher substance you know chocolate and it's chocolate alchemy watch the transmutation it's fun and you get to eat chocolate let's go make some so what I've got here is well I've got actually their model of the Milan cherry this is actually the original spec for 10 from Oh 10 years ago it's pretty much one of my workforces I've got I think four or five different Milan's around here so anyway we've got the Milan sure what I've done is this bowl and the stones inside are all preheated so we don't have to overcome you know a cold bowl and it generating friction and it just takes longer you can do it but I like preheating it just make your life easy 150 degrees you know put it in your oven put it on warm don't let it get too hot the epoxies actually aren't stable up above the 150 mark so pay attention to that you know 15 minutes half an hour or something like that anyway so that's all preheated the 700 grams of cocoa nibs or have been again being pre heating in this 11 just again take the chill off and you know I can reach in here and they're not really hot but they're not cold either they're well little thermometer here they are they're looking at about 120 degrees and they've only been there you know for 10-15 minutes just again take the chill off on the other hand I've got the cocoa butter the 5% cocoa butter the 50 grams then I've heated up actually pretty hot it helps again give more heat to the Milad sure helps the nibs gives them a fluid to work on and it just makes the whole process go easier you know and it is it's right at 300 degrees Fahrenheit pretty warm cocoa butter can actually take it it it doesn't start smoking till nearly 400 degrees doesn't burn doesn't really change the flavor that I've ever noticed so that's what I do I talked about it in a couple other types of chocolate the milk chocolate and the white chocolate but if you want to add a couple optional ingredients being lecithin or whole vanilla beans this would be a nice time to add them you know teaspoon of so thin in there if you want it's going to dissolve right down so we'll foam up a little bit or again kind of an elevating 1/2 scrape it out put it in while it's warm it's going to extract out really nice you know just like you know hot tea or hot coffee extracts better in hot water than cold water don't do it that's it without much else let's get going on this oh just cuz it's right here we've also got our 250 grams of sugar I may or may not pre-heat it we'll see how its flowing this will be adding this stuff in stages so we'll see let's go ahead and get the warm cocoa butter in get it running and get that top knot tied down and you can hear those slight change in as it starts to set in after that we want to get some of our nibs so initially the nibs aren't that hot but the underneath pans a little warm so and just come in just a handful at a time and what you're looking for is just this starting to slow down just a little bit and feed this in nice and slow you don't dump these in like you're baking a cake batter you just don't dump the ingredients in it's going to clog you got to feed it in a little time give it time to work these granite rollers are rolling on a lower plate of granite it's going to grind these nibs down so over the last half-hour about every 10 minutes or so I've added more nibs and all 700 grams all right now it's running very smoothly it's got a nice Sheen to it and so it's time to add the sugar and again we're gonna do it the same way don't just dump it all in you need to add it a little at a time and listen to it watch it is the wheels start to slow down a little bit stop give it five minutes it's going to reduce the particle size on that sugar and you can add more again so again optional you can preheat it if you want it's not too cold right now so I'm just gonna add it straight there you go you can hear it and again I'm just sprinkling in and we should be able to get actually a good majority of it in okay you can hear it start to the pitch of the machines dropping now I want to let it sit for a few more minutes while the particles reduce and and then we can have the rest of that sugar all right so the the sugar that I put in previously has ground down a little bit the the motors going easier it's got again it's gone from that grainy texture to a nice smooth glossy did you expect from chocolate so we're going to add the last of the sugar and again just you know feeding it in slowly there you go you can hear the wheels grinding it down there we go that's the last of that and okay so what you want to do next I mean again taste it along the way it's going to taste good it's going to be it's going to be a lot different than it's gonna be 24 hours from now it may taste actually very acidic right now pretty sharp and and I can sit here right now I can smell the acid coming off you need to let those release what that means is don't put the lid on yet leave it off for you know three hours there three hours leave it off because the other thing that's going to come off of this is water you know yes we've roasted stuff all these ingredients are dry but there is moisture in it and it almost feels like a contradiction but if we put this on moisture is going to condense on the inside of this it's going to then and mind you this is all flowing well it's going to drip in and that sudden shockable of that water that was in there already coming in as a clump can well seize the chocolate and your whole machine locks up and it's not a good situation so an hour or three hours leave it all after that time you know there you go put it on come back you know what is it a 21 hours after that so 24 hours from the time you started it and it it should be ready week and then you've made chocolate at that point you'll need to temper it if you want to but you know that's up to you at this point was making chocolate and that's what we've done all right so this has been a run this is our dark chocolate it's been running about 12 hours now I put the lid on about three hours after it was started one thing it's just handy to do is is take a spatula or something and run down the side of the bowl just hold it in place get anything that that's off the side of the bowl working in it should you know be pretty smooth at that point but it's just you know it's just handy to do so just get it in there work it down give it a scrape on the wheel and you know while you're at this I mean absolutely I'm give it a taste so at 12 hours even though it looks it looks like chocolate it's glossy it's flowing really wonderful you know at 12 hours on my tongue I can tell it's just it's got some texture to it and it's got some brightness to it more than I really want so and again I'd said run this 24 hours so that's what we're going to do so I just want to show you you know give it a scrape down halfway through if you remember you know eight hours 16 hours something like that and you know we'll pose it back up and come back 12 hours and we'll finish this up thanks all right it's been 24 hours let's check on the chocolate it basically looks looks like it did it 12 hours it's smooth you know from an aroma standpoint actually it's got more of a rich aroma there's not particularly the acidity that we had early on and you know sit here and check it and you know that is chocolate that is ready no for your taste if you want to keep it going you know feel free give it another full day if you want it's virtually over impossible to over refine in these so you know that's it we can turn that off you know something I didn't mention early on these have tension caps so you want to you know we've got to take the tension cap off now and spring holding those rollers in place so you know from the beginning you need to make sure you have that tightened all the way down yeah chocolate it gets messy let's go ahead and pull those rollers out normally I would sit and scrape those down really well it's like video I'm just going to set them right here and we're a little messy there um and yeah we have chocolate we're going to pour that up there this give it a nice scrape down you to and frankly you know that's going to be expected it's just what it is be aware and ready for it but aside from that there we go nice kilogram of chocolate dark chocolate you can temper this up you can you know just let it set up you can pour it onto a slab any number of things that you would do with any other chocolate except that you've made this one yourself that's it if you got any questions please feel free to drop me a line alka mr. chocolate out for me calm thanks for watching you", "z8Ood5Zmh-k": "hey there chris here with another kind of taste test slash review just wanted to talk to you a little bit about some other keto food that i use frequently in different desserts that i make at home use these in like peanut butter bars i use these in this different i guess you'd kind of call it like an almond flour cake that i make there's a couple different things that i use them in and of course you can just mix them in with nuts too so these are all natural stevia sweetened baking chips they are bake believe brand you can find them at walmart they are less expensive than lilies by a pretty considerable amount and they've got four different flavors today we see the dark chocolate and the white and then there's a milk chocolate and a semi-sweet so um looking at that at the back of the white chocolate you know you see your total carbs 10 with three fiber seven erythritol so your ingredients are the erythritol cocoa butter inland whole milk powder sunflower lecithin natural flavor vanilla extract and stevia so you know you're not going to have any of that malatol or any of those nasty sweeteners in here so that's why i go with this over any of the other options i mean lilies is a great option too it just costs a lot these are much better deal so that's the white one the dark chocolate has similar it looks like it's got a little more fiber and a little less erythritol obviously since it's not as sweet but either way these have worked great i've tried all four kinds i like them all i think they all are really good and i really like erythritol and that's probably my favorite sweetener that i use when it comes to making keto desserts as it is and then they just have you know a little bit of stevia too which i have no problem with i've been used to it for about five years so anyway check out bake believe uh you can get it at walmart every walmart i've ever been to has carried them and i believe you can order it online from walmart too and you probably can find it on amazon all right thanks a lot and have a good one", "q_zcgePZYAg": "we wouldn't be where we are without people like Tim our music is just a conglomeration of all sorts of early American music as well as any other music that any of us have heard reason people call it roots music you know call it traditional music it's it's basically I mean we don't think in terms of genres you know so much we don't think in terms of well this is in the old-time tune and this is a jazz tune and this is this to you know it was more fluid than that you know back in the day and that's like yeah we just guess kind of how we approach it we just take whatever we like and just perform it we are standing on the shoulders of not just the older player but also the people who came around her to the morning shred when I introduce three of them to John Dee home and he broke down and cry because he's pushing 80 and he didn't know where his music was going to go to and when these old men meet these young guys it'sit's they break down literally because they know their music because they want their music to live in their traditions live one of our many things that we just want to make sure that the music is still fresh and fun and still good and still coming from a good place you know and that can be hard to do in the music business you know then it's such an industry and it's kind of a grind sometimes and so that's why we feel so lucky to be working with people like 10 who were just like not telling us to how to dress and what what the play just kind of let this be which is very rare i think you know letting this beef we are and that's our goal is to continue to make a living doing the music that we naturally want to do instead of getting sort of put in a box that happens organically you", "6ffi1ELLjpc": "are you trying to figure out what the best dark chocolate brand is I've decided that I want to do a series of videos here on this channel trying to figure out what is that best dark chocolate brand and I've got one here today that I'm going to share with you guys we're gonna do a little taste test and see what we think about it first of all hi hi doll the new dads out there this is dad reviews is where I give you my unedited hopefully more authentic look at the products we like to use and have and not bite up putting my body because they're delicious so if you're interested in that you might want to consider clicking that subscribe button so I've been interested in like the health benefits of dark chocolate recently they've got a lot of polyphenols in it and they have a little bit of caffeine in it too which I try not to eat dark chocolates that is one thing that keeps me awake if I eat it too late in the day so I decided though I've really really really liked our chocolate though so I wanted to try out some different brands and figure out what that best brand is so today we're gonna do a little taste test of this guy right here it's the endangered-species strong velvety dark chocolate this has 88 percent cacao and it looks really it says bold cacao with hints of fruit and spice the ultimate and strong smooth dark chocolate and 10 percent of the net profits to save our wildlife that's why it's called the endangered species brand there so I started getting getting interested in dark chocolate whenever I read that bulletproof diet book because they were talking about you know how chocolates good for you and the benefits of it and all that type of stuff sauce like them maybe I could just add a little bit to my diet whenever like one little square a day or something like that not nothing huge and so I I'm interested in what's out there and this one has the ingredients are cacao sugar and van no that's not the ingredient ingredients bittersweet chocolate which is chocolate liqueur sugar soy lectin and vanilla so as far as far as a health considerations here this one may not be like the top top healthy in fact I did just in a video of this book right here called rich food poor food and chocolate is one of the things that they talk about in this book and I would be curious to taste out to test out some of the chocolates that they recommend in here because they look really interesting and I know that there would be good it's the Lucien's sugar-free 83% dark chocolate bar the cocoa polo 70% dark chocolate bar and then that's a hazelnut bar so let's get into this one today and see what we got here let's see it three grams of sugar by the way if you care about the home man look at how rich that thing looks just opening that up why don't they put like I feel like they should put that on the front like whenever you open it it's kind of like opening an envelope you know whenever you open an envelope and you pull a letter out and you like oh it's like the front of the letter and you see it and it's like all nice you know they should do the same thing with the chocolate here why don't they do that to where the pretty side is faced up like that so it's like you're opening a package and it's like oh wow this looks really nice and you know maybe some branding or something in there instead you get a flat back that didn't make any sense to me alright so it does come with the foil wrapper I guess that's foil it's a inner layer right there if you want to utilize that for you know why I don't know if that's like a preserve to help preserve it or what nice break on it here you go got a nice crisp snap broke straight right on the edge right there so that's awesome as I'm touching it my hands are a little hot I'm getting a little bit of residue on the finger there I don't know if y'all can see that there you go a little bit of residue of the chocolate melting in my fingers the it's got a little emblem in there it looks like a piece of bamboo since this is an endangered species thing I think they're going after the kind of panda thing right there let's uh let's taste this thing and see what it tape comes up if you guys are ready for me to taste this you just smash that thumbs up button yet I really appreciate it when you guys do that alright let's see we have mmm-hmm Wow mm-hmm so if not super duper sugary which is nice but surprisingly it's not very bitter either it's like a nice balance of sugar to to bitterness I really really like that actually cuz sometimes whenever you get chocolate and it's like way too bitter it just doesn't taste that good and you kind of get it hits you like right here and then if it's too sweet it's usually because they put too much sugar in it and it's not that healthy for you but this stuff is delicious you guys want to check this out I'll link it up down in the description below I'm gonna go read other people's reviews about it if people write reviews about food on Amazon sometimes I do sometimes they don't but uh 488 percent cacao that is amazing I think that the highest I've seen is 93 I need to get a 93 percent to see what that tastes like if you guys like any particular brand of chocolate let me know down in the comments below what that is and I'm gonna see if I can get my hands on some of that so that we can try out a whole bunch of different chocolates and we'll have a big series of videos here on the channel about the best chocolate and we figure out which one we like the most if you guys are liking what we're

talk to you about dark chocolate so what is dark chocolate dark chocolate usually has a higher cacao content than for example white or milk chocolate and it consists out of cacao butter cacao solids and sugar have a 100% dark chocolate you won't have sugar in there the range of dark chocolate is 70 to 100 percent let's take a closer look of what 70 percent actually mean usually when you buy chocolate you will find something like this 75 percent cacao or 74 percent cacao or 70 percent so what does this actually mean though 70 percent mmm that this is cacao solids and cacao butter and the rest 30 percent is sugar most Kraft chocolate makers are only using cacao solids sometimes cacao butter and sugar so if we check out the back side they use cacao beans that's our cacao solids the cane sugar so 30 percent needs to be the cane sugar and cacao butter so we don't know the exact ratio of cacao butter and cacao solids but we know that 70 percent of this chocolate bar is cacao and same for to 74 percent so 74 percent is cacao and the remaining 26 percent is sugar and same with the 75 percent some makers are not using cocoa butter but yes some do because of the higher cacao content usually dark chocolate tastes stronger and the flavor spectrum is broader just for example compared to milk chocolate also a quick note hood cover to cover trees used to depending or also to use as a glaze for cakes for example usually it's a high quality chocolate with a cacao content of 32 to 39 percent the cacao content of curvature is mostly higher than in dark chocolate which make which reduces the viscosity of your chocolate and makes it easier to work with I'm not using any curvature because I'm making chocolate by myself if I would have to buy a converter I would probably go for my Rhona I love their quality they have a great taste and a chocolate is really easy to work with that's what I wanted to share with you today about dark chocolate I hope you liked the video hit the

surprise here got this mixing bowl kodiak dark chocolate power kicks rapes on dopa how much do you put in there I don't know how many pancakes do you want this for something if you don't have enough batter and you just add more later and more water slowly slowly slowly going on those things because good things come to those who wait more applicable here good pancakes take the time these lumps in here all these maybe you can see a couple the lumps are like little chocolate futures there's a lesson full keep your pancake spatulas reserved for pancakes only because you can reuse that spatula every day and clean it very easily because there's nothing gets stuck to the spatula it's no eggs or anything to keep a special pancake spatula you're better off doing it we have with chocolates all right [Music] there's my pancakes board up now we need to put the chocolate on them for chocolates sake basically like chocolate chips except they're not chocolate chips they're these things stocks chocolate stars inside chocolate pancakes which there's gonna be chocolate on top it's kind of taste good wash your hands Roca got a pink towel over here that's what a woman's touch does to your kitchen so it's alright though alright alright thank you already done because you took forever trying to put the chocolate in there flip one BAM yep [Applause] they don't need longer cook so meet our plate and about ready their chocolates here get a chocolate here chocolate topping sugar-free so I always get sugar for you because it's just sometimes it gets too sugary for me like the chocolates in their sugar enough for the pancakes as the pancakes don't have very much sugar so I keep it sugar free for the chocolate topping or anything else I stack them up good tip here is get your bigger pancakes on the bottom smaller pancakes on the top that way pancakes more structurally stable and yeah it just looks better no we gotta line them up here make sure the stack intentional looks good just gonna have to use your eye because after all this is pancake art and you have to give your own flair to the pancakes hmm you know some people might even throw them off sideways and stuff I'm not gonna do that but that looks good beautiful all right now I need my phone because I do videos and stuff for Instagram some of these broken up on top I think that's gonna look good instead of look we're really taking time I might shave these up so it's just like a lot of chocolate shavings on there good what I'm just gonna do this and they'll give me a pretty good effect just by doing it like that so once I got that set up I take and make sure everything's on frame for the square video that'll be my way to see here sticking out a little bit like that and I don't like the look of that so I'm just gonna give it a little rotation and that's gonna fix it just like that and we're set a little bit forward to a little bit more frame you just just get her all over there I like to do little little lines rather than kind of like cover the whole top of chocolate this looks better and you get to watch it kind of drizzle down I think it looks pretty good I'm just gonna be one more thing here a little bit of the chocolate on top I think that looks good finally finalized up the Instagram video cut it take your square photo now just like that a snapchat take a picture there save it go back to our video now we need the fork so I don't like to waste dishes so I'll just come back up I'm gonna trim off the paper towels got one all right a lot of times it's not like this sometimes a lot of stuff stacked and it'll be very precariously set and you need to do things kind of fast in order to get the shop so sometimes it stressful but here it's alright now we're gonna do the cut through getting read in as a song where to take that monster bite you just rotate it and seem to the insides feel moist it is so chocolatey see how delicious it is up close and in person like that see the pancake and the recording very chocolatey see the chocolates inside they melted it tastes really good it's pretty good I don't know why I wouldn't rate it it's good sauce the pancake I'm subscribed to

to my kitchen today have another back the cake basics episode for you and I'll be showing you how to prepare chocolate ganache two different ways the first one will be my chocolate place which I use in so many of my video recipes and the second one is going to be a light and fluffy chocolate ganache filling which can be used for pastries and macaron let me show you how to prepare these first my chocolate glaze when you get to see me uses in so many of my videos I've measured out 1/3 cup of heavy cream and I like to use one that has a fat content of at least 35% and I've measured out one cup of semi-sweet baking chocolate chips and I recommend using a high quality brand you want to heat the heavy cream until it's really nice and hot and then add the chocolate right in and after a few minutes to start stirring the chocolate into the cream until it's completely smooth [Music] and you want to stir that chocolate until it's completely melted and smooth now if your chocolate is being stubborn you can pop it into the microwave at 10-second intervals stirring after each time you can simply pour the glaze right out of your measuring cup onto the cake what I like to do is transfer it into a disposable pastry bag and I like to wrap it around a cup that way it holds everything in place and then pour that glaze in and that's it for my chocolate glaze I usually let the chocolate cool for a minute or two in the pastry bag and then pipe it over my cake [Music] and now for the second chocolate ganache I've heated one cup of heavy cream that I'm going to pour into a large bowl and add one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips let the chocolate chip stand in the heavy cream for a few minutes allowing it to melt and then whisk the mixture until that chocolate is completely melted and you have a smooth chocolate cream and now to transform this chocolate ganache from a cream into a fluffy filling I'm going to chill the cream at five-minute intervals so every 5 minutes I'm going to take it out of the refrigerator and whisk it first with my whisk and then switch over to my hand mixer essentially we want to add as much air as we possibly can into the chocolate and cream as it cools so we get a really fluffy mixture so as it cools you'll see it start to thicken [Music] [Applause] and that's it for my chocolate ganache filling look at how creamy and smooth it is this is going to be the perfect filling for a cake a pie tarts or even macaron cookies and that's it guys for my chocolate ganache tutorial I did want to mention that you can use white chocolate chips for a white glaze or a colored glaze I do recommend adding a little bit of white food coloring to make the glaze less opaque and then add your favorite colors I hope you guys are enjoying this video recipe and I hope it's useful for next time you need a beautiful chocolate glaze or a light and fluffy chocolate filling thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next time [Music]", "JL_uJ4B018Q": "[Music] foreign

gluten-free on a shoestring if you don't follow her yet you should check her out she's got some great recipes wonderful baking recipes and tips as well this recipe is loosely based off of her lemon ice zucchini bread I am doing without the lemon and I'm doing without the icing so I'm just using the zucchini base for my bread it is packed full 2 cups full of grated zucchini and then instead of doing the lemon aspect of it I'm instead going to add in 1 cup of dark chocolate chips makes it a little more kid-friendly I'm hoping my kids will eat it things that it's packed of grain stuff that the chocolate will help a little bit so let's see how that goes okay so I've got my mixer here and let me point it downwards for ya I'm gonna show you everything that I add into the mixer and we're gonna get going okay so first you're gonna do a gluten-free blend today I'm using all Bob's Red Mill ingredients this is their baking flour I purchased it at Fond available here locally also at sprouts or pavilions not all baking mixes are treated equal remember this it is very important there are so many variants in blends textures tastes the way it rises everything is completely different when you're baking gluten free this is a great one to one ratio to convert any of your regular baking recipes into a gluten free there is a difference between baking flour or just a regular gluten-free flour mix sometimes those have different flours being the texture and the taste will be very different so if your baking I would stick to a gluten free baking flour I have quite a few variations my favorites that I to youth which will be featured on my blog coming up soon so make sure to check out there my website Amy gf girl calm for more baking tips today we're going to use this one okay it calls for a 1 and 5/8 cup to the exact so we're going to measure that out there we go and when you are baking gluten free it is very important to have exact measurements as exact as you can ok so we're throwing that in the mixer next we're going to use a product called Sansom dum when you are baking make sure that your baking mix does not have it added in if it does not then you need to add the xanthan gum we're going to do 1 teaspoon typically the ratio is one cup you get one teaspoon of xantham gum okay this is a product also by Bob's Red Mill we're gonna add that in it is a binding agent basically it will help you or bread stay together and not completely crumble apart as you eat it when you take out regular flour or wheat that has gluten in it you are taking out that agent that keeps everything together and binds it so you need to add something else in otherwise you're going to have a crumpled mess on your plate so we've got the flour we've got the xantham down next your choice corn starch or potato starch I'm going to Kato search also Bob's Red Mill we're going to do 6 full tablespoons so it may sound like a lot if you've never experienced potato starts before it's super light and fluffy really it feels like snow so we're going to do 6 sounds like a lot tablespoons of that too again making sure to level off the top so we're exact okay and last one okay next we are moving to baking soda you're gonna do half a teaspoon okay and then you're gonna do one full teaspoon baking powder if you haven't heard this trick also shake up your baking powder before you use it typically it's not a product we use a ton and keep it in your refrigerator as you do baking soda it will settle believe it or not so you want to shake it up so that you're mixing it back to life basically one full teaspoon baking powder okay half a teaspoon salt I'm using coarse pink Himalayan it's gonna give a little grind okay next sugar I am using coconut sugar high in fiber really low glycemic you can bake with it on a one to run one-to-one ratio just as you would wait regular refined white sugar so I'm opting for this instead it's a definitely a healthier choice it kind of looks like brown sugar and it's consistency you can find it at sprouts or bonds pavilions here locally in Southern California as well okay so that was one cup sugar I'm gonna raise this up and start mixing on low all of the dry ingredients we're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're going to begin to our wet ingredients I'm just gonna add as it mixes we're going to need to pull a and that we are using an oil now the recipe calls for a neutral oil canola or peanuts I am opting for coconut i coconut oil for all of my baking that is 5 tablespoons worth of melted down coconut oil math ingredient is the zucchini I'm going to make sure that this is mixed together I'm going to kick it up a little bit it's gonna look a little dry and crumbly and it's touchier not to worry all right I'm going to turn it back down and lower it to add the zucchini and then holding tight I always forget my spoons when I do these videos it's ridiculous Sylla comes phone okay we're going to push down all of the ingredients off of the side and off of the paddle of your mixer and then we're going to start it back up again roll it up you've got the zucchini in there now keep it on low for a second just to give it a minute to get your mind and then you can kick it up a bit now this is where I think the change in the original recipe and not adding any other lemon or doing the icing on top of the bread once it's finished baking so at this point I'm gonna go ahead and add my chocolate chips I I would probably only normally do a half of a cup however I only had one cup left for the OSS dark chocolate chips you do have to watch you our brand for chocolate to make sure that they are going to read it well okay I'm gonna put this down in here and show you guys okay mix things together really well notice that it's not crumbly anymore okay it looks perfect I'm going to go ahead and turn it off our oven has been preheating at 325 degrees and I prepared the bread pan it says to grease the bottom of your pan so greasing to me is coconut oil spray I use this for all of my baking whenever I need to line my pans with something before I put the batter in coconut spray coconut oil basically it can be found at Vons or pavilions here so with that I'm going to remove the paddle point it back down here for you and we are going to put the batter right into the pan like I said your oven has been preheating to 325 degrees you're gonna bake this for 50 minutes almost a full hour okay it sounds long but the bread is dense and it does come vegetables added so you will definitely need that cook time okay got my bread pan here this is going to be a great treat for the kiddos after school and wonderful with my coffee for breakfast tomorrow morning which is what I'm really excited about okay so once you get it all out you need to level it off halfway through your baking time I would check to see how golden or brown the top is getting you might want to cover the top with foil if it is getting too Brown so that the top doesn't burn you don't want the top burn and then the middle to be uncooked okay now we're gonna level this off show you what it looks like the pan should be about halfway full it will rise sometimes gluten-free items when you're baking don't raise a ton just depends on the flour blends that you are using so I will be sure to post a picture of the finished product on my Instagram and EGF girl and my facebook also energy up girl okay oh here we go this is going to go in the oven right now for 50 minutes I hope you enjoy it please make it if you do it's probably if you do leave me a comment on my facebook or my Instagram let me know that you tried it let me know if you like it or not and then maybe sometime this summer I love to bake with lemon lemon bars are one of my favorite thing to make gluten free and I have a fantastic recipe that my BFF and I came up with so I will definitely do some lemon over the summer until then I'll see you soon bye bye",

"0nokbOhuI4Y": "I'm Victoria cooksey and this is how to make flourless peanut butter cookies with a little chocolate of course this recipe is super simple to make and a mixer we're just going to put one large egg a half a cup of white sugar one fourth cup packed brown sugar a teaspoon baking soda and a full teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix that up to start once that's all mixed up then you're going to add in a cup of chunky peanut butter and you want to go with the chunky kind because it both kind of adds a pretty look to it when the cookies finished but honestly I think it amplifies that peanut butter taste so I might have seen me do this before I've lined my cup with some plastic so that way I've measured it but now I really honestly I'm just peeling back the plastic wrap and scooping it in because I don't like to clean up a really sticky measuring cup full of peanut butter maybe you do so enjoy but this is a great way to skip that process mix that in well besides the peanut butter which I love I also do more chocolates like you may have guessed if you know me at all on any level today I'm using a full cup of chocolate now originally was thinking a little less chocolate believe it or not but one of my taste testers who will not be named Michelle Michelle Michelle happened to say no no I like the full cup of chocolate keep it in so that's what we're going to do today I've got the gets hard extra dark chocolate chips but i also like chocolate 55-percent chips and ghirardelli 60-percent chips are good too so kind of whatever you like in this recipe so just dump those in and mix them in just for a couple seconds and here's what the batter looks like when it's all ready to go I also added a fourth teaspoon of Celtic sea salt to this that I actually ground up in instead of putting pepper at a pepper grinder just go ahead and put your salt in one of those and grind it so grey salt Celtic sea salt Brittany salt are going to find it under one of those for scooping these cookies up my scooper hold about two and a half tablespoons worth of batter and you're just going to keep putting them on a cookie sheet about three in a row is good these cookies are all scooped up and ready to go into a 350 degree oven you're going to get around 12 cookies out of this if you use a similar size scoop bake these for 20 minutes rotating the pan halfway through what you're looking for is for it actually to have a bit of a dry look you want the center to look dry and that's how you know they're done I just took these out of the oven you want to let them sit on the cookie sheet for two minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack now all we have to do is find a way to kill a little time while we wait for these to cool off so we can eat them now we can spend that time pondering hmm should I have this with tea should I have it with coffee you can also spend the time looking me up on Instagram at Victoria Cooke see on twitter at victoria see random on

this idea um because i was moving for chocolate shocker and i was like not a bad idea so i have a ton of chocolates and yeah i just want to try them all and i've only had three of the kinds out of one two three four five seven kinds of chocolate it's like i've had a little less than half but the other ones i've not tried and i'm like kind of excited but kind of nervous like i don't know but anyways let's get into the video so i have seven different types of chocolate and i'm gonna be rating them from like one to seven obviously because they're seven and also like i'm gonna write them out three things one like the flavor two the packaging and three the price yes okay so first we have we're starting from small we're gonna start from smallest to biggest um yeah like size wise i got this one like last minute so i just got a small one because i was like anyways this one has a nice packaging ish sort of it's like middle it's like packaging out of 10 i would give it i don't know yet but it looks good um this is the zoet i think that's a zoey i don't know it's premium belgium chocolate and it's extra dark chocolate 70 this is a 1.4 ounce and it cost me a dollar for this so per ounce it's um 71 cents per ounce so all right oh so you open it it opens right up into the chocolate i don't know how sanitary that is but whatever and you get 12 squares so that's fancy so packaging i'm gonna give it a five or six price that's cheat like obviously not well i guess it is like as cheap as a hershey bar like when you go to a store these are a dollar their ones are a dollar so price cheap i'd give it an 8 or a 9 out of ten for price um and then for taste kind of the weird like dryness of my mouth i don't know kind of not good i had a good first flavor i'd probably give it a 5 out of 10. i probably wouldn't buy it again actually yeah i would not buy it again so gross next we have to chow i don't know how to say it but this is what it looks like um it was 3.59 and that means it's a and it's 2.5 ounces so it means it's a dollar and 43 cents per ounce so it's a little bit not high but like medium maybe i don't know but um it looks promising it's not like fancy but it's not like but the texture on this wrapper kind of vibing um sorry this is just like notes um yeah ingredients look amazing it's a 70 dark chocolate with rich chocolatey notes i hope all right so this one you open it and opens up to another package i like doing that because i feel like when you open it and open straight up into like chocolate it's like was that really like clean you know but you open it it looks like you have nine squares like just based on it but it's a nice gold little thing just gonna we'll send it it wow actually when you open this they've got a little like i don't know if you can see that like fancy okay i don't know if that goes all the way down through oh no just right there okay anyways i got a chocolate okay so oh wait that was good kind of anyways for packaging i'd give it a seven no if i give that one a five this is like a seven and a half for packaging a seven and a half for the price kind of on the spongier side of like the chocolaty at the grocery store um i probably have to give it like a a four on the price and then the taste it hit super sweet it was like and then it kind of settled like the after taste so good like the last little hints like the first hint was like boom sugar so i'd have to give that one probably a six of ten maybe like a six and a half it actually wasn't that bad i probably actually i'll give it a seven i'll give it a seven okay that one has a seven next we have um green and black's organic chocolate this one i think is gonna be promising it was three dollars and twelve cents and it's three point one seven ounces so that means it's like literally it's like it barely less than a dollar it's 98 cents i don't ounce owns an oats anyways so this one looks good ingredients look tasty um oh when you open this one it comes that's a good packaging on the inside okay oh it's got like little leaves on it i don't know if you can do that but we've got a lots of mini squares i don't know how i feel about that but i'm gonna open it up anyway i'm gonna open up anyways like i wasn't gonna open it but oh i just broke through the packaging my bad that was my i totally just did that myself okay what was in that oh um so the packaging was i would say 9 out of 10 like that was solid packaging price pretty good like i feel like a dollar an ounce is solid like full cent like i'd give that probably like a nine out of ten um but or any i give it an eight at a time price the chocolate though okay it was kind of good at first but then i was like i'd probably give the chocolate a four out of 10. it was not that great again i'm going to finish that little square nope next we've got cocoa love so it's 2.98 like three dollars and it's 3.2 ounces which means it's 93 cents an hour it's like that's pretty solid and um i have had this one before and okay anyways so packaging it looks good open it okay well that didn't happen to me last time i had it so if you open it into another package it's i'm all as you know and it actually oh this is a different quote from last time anyways they give you little poems in the inside and then on these ones um the chocolate the little hearts on them i don't know if you can see that but yeah um let me just try it oh so good all right anyways um coco love packaging 10 out of 10 price tag talent that was less than a dollar an ounce and it's awesome oh flavor um i'd give this one a nine and a half out of ten obviously like it could be teensy bit better but it's really up there it's like all in here but it's not like to the ceiling but it's like all the way there okay anyways so good so nine and a half out of ten for that um hey that's been announced this one in first place next we have sam's swiss sam's choice swiss dark chocolate 90 percent this is a dollar ninety eight which means and it's 3.5 ounces which means it was 56 and a half cents 56 cents per ounce like what hold on you know um and it's premium swiss chocolate like go you you know and you open it up and it has some did you know facts about the chocolate and you slide it out and then there's um how to taste chocolate um it opens up to this nice packaging i'm just really bad at opening chocolate it's fine every time i open it it ends up going wrong so and all the squares say sam's choice oh my god so good wow wow okay show packaging i gave it another time when they gave me like some things to know like did you know and stuff and it came in separate like two packaging things um i'll give it a nine and a half actually not a half out of ten for packaging um for the price 10 out of 10. two dollars and it was like 50 cent 56 cents an ounce like okay go for you 10. and then for taste i probably give it another time because um it was smooth it was chocolaty yes it was chocolatey because it was chocolate but yeah it was so good um yeah so nine out of ten would recommend send it actually i'm gonna give it a 9.3 i think it deserves more than a nine but like not a ten yet you know next we have lint excellence sorry i have to like go in two minutes i have to really read that um all right this is 262 to buy and that means it's 75 cents an ounce and it's 3.5 ounces um you open it up to fancy packaging they don't give you anything to read so i don't know if that's a plus or negative and you open up they have a lint packaging all over it i have had this one you open it up and you try a square and this is what it looks like okay oh it's 85 is that right yeah 85 percent oh okay so first off pri packaging packaging was probably an eight and a half at a time i didn't like have like a sense of like we care about you you know it's just like here's a chocolate like that like you didn't have a poem in it it didn't have words or stuff to like help you taste the chocolate i don't know it was like not it's not they don't have the care but they have the presentation you know so an eight um price i'd probably give this one a nine out of ten um on price it was pretty good price like okay and flavor okay this one gets around a half out of ten like okay is good um it was like i had a great like this great flavor of the cocoa and like it was creamy too and i was just like oh last but not least ghirardelli i've never had this one before but i feel like people will say a lot about it it was 224 which means it's it's 70 cents an ounce because it's 3.17 ounces you open it you take it out and it has like little ghirardelli little packaging um all right oh it's a big square um and it's got uh the ghiri delhi little thing we'll just try it oh this one's 86 percent okay packaging eight out of ten they don't have care if they have it down you know presentation they have down but it's just not they don't have the care price i feel like it was a reasonable price um probably an eight out of ten i don't know i don't remember um next flavor it reminded me of the this one the green and blacks has that like wheat not a good chocolatey taste i'd probably give this one uh like a six no five out of ten not really that good so yes my mom went to the dollar store and picked she saw this and picked up this that's a lot of sugar um it doesn't say what percent is chocolate product of poland so that's a little bit more promising i think it's like the hershey bar of poland this is what the squares look like oh right on the packaging packaging i'd say i mean it's sealed but it's like not a fancy one but for going off like the fancier kind um probably like a four it's not bad but it's just like a hershey bar nothing fancy so actually a three i'll go to three um price is a dollar for 3.5 ounces so cheap i'll give it a 10 out of 10 on the price but it's a larger bar a bit sweeter than hershey bar really sweet for hershey brown okay but it has a hershey flavor yeah like i just taste like dark chocolate chips i could get like toll house or hershey's like dark hershey bar like yeah so nothing special average gonna have to give it like a four i'm not the biggest fan of hershey so yeah so if i had to put them in order um i will right here on the screen i can't i don't want to do that right now i have to get ready for work okay bye thank you for watching please don't

Drops remember the name and indulge yourself today", "9dcUslJkcYs": "[Music] hi I'm a Jew welcome to sharing cooking secrets today I'm going to show you another chocolate garnish the chocolate cigarettes so I've got some dark chocolate melted here and white chocolate and if you want to know how to not chocolate please see the link below these are ideally made on a granite or a marble surface okay so I've got my melted chocolate here and make sure it's room temperature chocolate okay so I'm just going to spread a little bit of the dark chocolate and I'm gonna spread this with my knife it's called a pallidly [Music] now when you make chocolate cigarettes I can't guarantee the first day you make or you try them that you're going to succeed you have to practice and the temperature of the chocolate is very important so we have to wait until the chocolate sets and then we have to try and try and make a few and and to see if the chocolate has come to the right temperature only if the chocolate comes to the correct temperature will you be able to take out the cigarettes correctly okay so we let it dry up and then I'll explain to you how and we use this tool called a scrape this is the best equipment to use to take out the cigarettes clean this up get it up [Music] now just check the chocolate see it's not coming back on my fingers so I know it's setting not if it if it over sets of what will happen when you try to take out cigarettes they will break if it's under set if the chocolate is under set and when you try to remove the cigarettes they will come out like a flat piece of chocolate so let me just show you what I mean so I've got this scraper and I'm going to hold it with both of my hands see my fingers are here and my thumb is at the back okay so I'm going to place this about 45 degrees angle and about an inch I'm going to take an inch right and you have to do this in one shot okay and press it down and push if it comes out like a cigarette you know you're there so this is I'm not really happy with this one it's a bit still soft the chocolate needs to set up a bit more then I'll try another one if it becomes too hard you can just rub it with the palm of your hand like this so let's try again [Music] now it's hardened so I'm just gonna soft it up with my hand a little bit if the chocolate is correctly set they just come out so easily and so beautifully [Music] need to apply a little bit of strength right now these these parts you can you know a little bit untidy you can just chop them off like this [Music] so now I'm going to show you another decoration the same cigarettes but in a different style for the next decoration are the cigarettes I'm going to do a two color cigarette now for this I will need a teeth comb this is called a teeth comb it looks like this and they come in in this plastic ones as well okay so first of all I'm going to drizzle the white chocolate [Music] we spread the white chocolate I want to thin there you don't have to do such a long one you can do a shorter one would be easier for you I guess now take the comb make sure this layer is not too thick let's remove this part now we need to wait until this semi sets you can tell by just touching it it doesn't come back on your hands slightly wet [Music] this is [Music] now have my dark chocolate and make sure the dark chocolate is not hot it has to be room temperature because if this is hot and you pour this on your white chocolate the white chocolate obviously is going to melt okay so make sure it's not hot [Music] again you don't want a very thick layer if it's too thick it will be difficult for you to take out the cigarettes now again I need to clean up [Music] if the layer of chocolate that you've applied if it's too thick even then it may not grow so with your scraper you can just remove some of the chocolate from the top okay so that's fine so let's try it again [Music] oh yes perfect see how easily if everything is correct it'll come out beautifully if it's too thick it won't come out it'll come out like a thick strip so you don't want that and if it breaks when you're doing this if it breaks that will tell you the chocolate is too hot in that case you can just soften it with the palm of your hand okay [Music] this is how easily it should come out [Music] find it maybe it's a too thick here so I'll just scrape off a bit this all practice and a little experience you need to do this but once you get it you never forget [Music] can you see the thicker one what happened it kind of opened up like this right and the one which is been perfectly is like this [Music] sip that fantastic Lily beautiful whenever you're working with white chocolate you must make sure that your marble top your granite top is absolutely clean okay so this one I'm showing you another variation I've got some melted chocolate and then I've seen that and I'm gonna make a really really tiny cut I'm just going to make some swirls you can do anything you want this looks really stunning so easy they look swinging you be nice okay so we wait until this semi sets once again I'm gonna pour our white chocolate on them okay and you can do buy silver so you can fight white chocolate and then you can cover it with the dark chocolate so I have my melted white chocolate and I'm gonna pour this on top [Music] [Music] patience is the name of the game you have to be patient and wait until the chocolate comes to the correct temperature [Music] [Music] regrets with this so I'm just going to scrape the top off a little bit because just finding it a little bit thick [Music] [Music] rub it with your hand the palm of your hand right and let's try [Music] a little thinner [Music] that's a beautiful thing as well by default [Music] lovely [Music]", "C0_ngzphxgk": "baking soda [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]

super yummy stuff and it's used for a variety of different things it's the filling in truffles YUM which you can flavor any flavor raspberry chocolate well yeah it's chocolate orange champagne whatever you want but ganache is also great used as a cake filling and to also mask your cakes with they use it a lot in Australia the really nice thing about ganache is it sets fairly hard without the use of a refrigerator so if you're doing a large sculpted cake that doesn't fit in your refrigerator you can coat it or mask it with ganache instead of using buttercream because it doesn't fit in your fridge and to cover that cake it's always best if it's cold or if your outer surface is hard and to harden buttercream you have to put it in the fridge so ganache also you know those ever so ever so popular drip cakes that's done using ganache as well in different colors you can use white chocolate and color it with the chocolate chameleon colors work really well for that you don't want to use gels to color your chocolate because it will seize your chocolate so the consistency you're going for for when you're masking a cake or coating a cake is this peanut buttery sort of consistency and once you get it on the cake it will set up and firm up as it sits as well so we're going to make a batch it's really super easy and has two yummy ingredients that's it so we have chocolate and whipping cream two of the best things in the world right so today I'm working with milk chocolate the quantities for dark chocolate I do the same also check our recipe page recipe pages because the quantities for white chocolate ganache are a little bit different and the recipe is there okay so but today cuz white milk chocolates my favorite that's what I'm working with so we have 500 grams sorry Americans 500 grams of milk chocolate and it's good quality chocolate you want chocolate that you'd want to eat okay it's couverture chocolate which means it's pure chocolate it's not a candy coating which I often recommend sorry let me eat this I often recommend for modeling chocolate and things like that but ganache you want to use the highest quality of ingredients so we are doing that today so it's pure milk chocolate 500 grams and we have 2 250 mils whipping cream so it's like sort of like 2 2 1 2 parts chocolate one part cream but 250 milliliters which is 1 cup or 8 ounces fluid ounces to 500 grams of chocolate and I know my American friends use ounces but your scale at home converts both ways so just I can I'll put it in the recipe what what this weighs in ounces but it's 500 grams ok so most recipes for ganache are going to tell you to heat the cream and then pour it into the chocolate and let it just sit and the chocolate will slowly melt from the heat of the cream I do it a little bit differently I use my microwave and I just dump the cream in this creams been sitting out a bit so it's room temperature but you can definitely use it straight from the fridge and I'm gonna pop this in the microwave so I'll probably start at about 1 minute but maybe check it at about 45 because all all microwaves are different strengths so let's pop this in the microwave and sit and wait [Laughter] okay so that was one minute in the microwave I'm just going to give it a little bit of a stir our chocolates starting to melts but not completely I'll probably put it in for another 30 seconds but this microwave is a little stronger than the one I have at home so maybe I'll do 20 just to be safe okay but you can see not all the chocolate is melted so I'm gonna put this back in maybe I'll do 25 seconds living on the edge okay see what we've got here I might have to put it in for a little bit longer but I think we're gonna be okay so at this point pretty much I believe my chocolate is all melted and now it's just carefully stirring you don't want to slop this all around I did that yesterday when I was making this batch I was a little bit aggressive with my stirring and it splashed everywhere but it's super glossy and beautiful and shiny if you are going to use this as a drizzle or a drip on your cake you want to let it cool because if you put it on warm on your cake not cool so much that it starts to set like this but just room temperature because if you pour this on your cake warm it's gonna melt the butter cream underneath and you're gonna get a huge mess really quite it still tastes good but it'll be ugly so I'm almost there and we have ganache super simple so like I said this is great for a drip cake or to drizzle over a chocolate cake and andro bit like a soccer torte and otherwise if you're going to use it to mask your cake you're going to cover it with some plastic wrap and let it sit for a few hours preferably overnight and then you'll get this peanut buttery consistency which is perfect for masking your cakes okay especially your 3d cakes or if you are doing a painted cake and you don't it's summertime and super humid and you don't want to refrigerate that cake because when you pull them out of the fridge they start to sweat and you don't want your beautiful painting to drip then it would be a good that would be a good time to use ganache instead of buttercream and let your cake sort of solidify at room temperature and then cover with your fondant and then no need for a fridge okay just make sure your fillings are stable at room temperature don't be putting fresh fruits and mousse and things like that but if it's just a buttercream filling you're fine to leave it out overnight okay so that is ganache super yummy check out our recipes we have a recipe while the recipe for dark chocolate I use the same quantities but definitely if you're interested in white chocolate ganache especially for those cakes

[Music] you", "55w65rj0pJQ": "[Music] hello and welcome to crumbs and doilies HQ now today I am gonna show you guys something really cool that you've been asking for for a really long time and I'm really sorry it's taken me this long to get around to it it is how to do the perfect drip cake and is an absolute smash of a technique so drip cakes have been around for a few years now and I don't think they're losing any popularity soon we do so many drip cake syrup crumbs and doilies almost all of our cakes have a drip on them and they look fantastic but some of you guys have experienced a little bit of difficulty because there is a bit of a knack to getting it just right and over the years we've kind of tweaked our recipes and methods for the perfect dripping action so I'm going to share with you all the secrets so I'm going to show you how to do a drip with dark chocolate ganache and also with white chocolate which you can then color so we're going to start with the dark chocolate one and it's really important to remember with this ganache that you're going to be using equal weights of chocolate and cream this is definitely not a recipe you want to cup so please don't ask me for cup measurements I'm not going to give them to you I don't even know them because it's the weight that's important here because we're going to be using a 50/50 ratio so I'm gonna be using 60 grams of dark chocolate and 60 grams of double cream and that just will not equate to cup C equal cups so vanish those cups guys all so the chocolate that I'm using is important I'm not going to be using a 70% cocoa solids dark chocolate I'm going to look for something in between 50 and 60% it'll be a little bit less bitter and actually drips a bit easier and with the cream I'm using double cream or heavy cream so anything that's a 30% fat all over is just right so what do we do first well I'm going to add my cream to my chocolate the easiest way to make ganache is in the microwave but don't worry if you don't have one you can do this on a hob so you would just bring your cream just to the boil and then pour over the chocolate let it sit for a couple of minutes and then stir it and then you've got ganache but we're gonna do it in the microwave because this is quite a small amount I'm going to start by doing it for 20 seconds then I'm gonna stir afterwards and then I'm going to do 5 or 10 second bursts stirring after each one until it's just melted now the consistency of ganache is pretty important which means that if you overheat your cream and chocolate it can go a little bit thick so you don't want to get it too hot which is why you do it very short bursts and the dripping consistency is also very important you want it to be dripping enough that it runs down and stops not so thick that you have a big bulbous blob at the end of your drip and not say thin that it just kind of all disappears and into a pool at the bottom of your cake board we definitely don't want that and so you might find that you need to just wait a minute before you use it and for your ganache to kind of cool down a little bit I find that one good way of testing it is against the side of the bowl actually before you put it in a piping bag so you just pick up a bit with your spatula and just dribble it down the side and see how it moves [Music] and I think that is just right so the easiest way of piping drips onto a cake is using a piping bag or even a squeezy bottle if you're doing quite a lot or a large cake you don't need to use a nozzle in your batch piping bag at all just pack it straight in and this amount that I've given you with 60 grams of both chocolate and cream is enough to completely drip an 8-inch cake and if you're making a smaller cake or a larger cake just adjust the quantities up or down because this is an equal 50/50 recipe it's really easy to do that and then you just want you take off a small amount off the end definitely don't make your hole too big otherwise it's just going to come gushing out so if you guys want to practice first before you go nuts on your actual cake then I would recommend doing in the bowl you can do it around the side that way you can always put it back into your piping bag when you finish so you're not wasting anything I'm gonna do this straight onto my cake because I've done it a few times before so there's a couple of things to remember one is that don't forget about gravity gravity is going to help with your drip so you don't want to just keep on squeezing thinking that that amount of ganache is going to be plenty because you might find that in a minute or two it is just all pulled down at the bottom of your board there's another thing you need to think about and that is the spacing of your drips if you like it to be even then obviously make it even but also applied it an even amount of pressure on your bag if you like it a bit more regular like I do then just do it a little bit more haphazardly like a little squeeze here and a longer squeeze there and I quite like that look so and I'm also using a turntable just because it makes it easier to turn my cake and work around it rather than kind of having to move my entire body around and I'm going to start on one side doesn't really matter and start squeezing gently [Music] and when you start just do a small section at a time and then move your cake around so that you're sort of sure what's happening also if you are kind of practicing for the first time on your cake and you get these first ones slightly wrong and that's just going to be the back of your cake don't worry too much about it just adjust your squeeze accordingly all right so that is the drip all around the outside and you might want to leave it at that because you've got some kind of other plans for the top but if you want to fill the top you just want to pour some ganache on top obviously and spread it around but I would say don't put all of it on at first just in case there's a bit too much and it kind of ruins the edges and then to cover it I'm going to be using a cranked pallet knife which is going to spread it all around neatly and that is it done so looking lovely and neat and drippy and gorgeous and ganache will want to be set a little bit in the fridge so they just pop that in the fridge for half an hour but that's your cake drip now the white chocolate drip now we're not going to be using a ganache for this because white chocolate ganache has a very very different consistency to regular chocolate ganache and it doesn't drip quite the same so instead we're just going to be using white chocolate but to keep it drippy I'm going to be adding a little bit of cocoa butter which is going to help it to be a little bit more runny and I'm also going to add a bit of super white powder that's this stuff and that is because white chocolate really isn't white at all it's actually a more kind of creamy yellow color which isn't always what you want especially when you've got an amazing cake like this that's got all the colors on it and you want it to really pop and then you want to put like murky yellow drips on it you want a white drip so that is why I'm using super white powder but if you don't want to do that that's absolutely fine so I've got 110 grams of white chocolate and I'm gonna add 5 grams of cocoa butter which I've chopped up into little pieces and about an eighth of a teaspoon of a superboy and you can either see for white after you've melted the white chocolate but because it's kind of grainy and lumpy it can be quite difficult to mix in so I like to put it in at this stage just to make sure it's all mixing and then just like before with a dark chocolate ganache you want to do this in the microwave start off with a 20-second blast give it a good stir and then do it for five or ten second blast after that stirring after each one now it might seem like nothing's really happening at this point and all the way along with white chocolate because it does take a little bit longer to melt as does the cocoa butter but it feel really important to do it gently and in short bursts just so that it does it evenly [Music] so this is the perfect consistency but with white chocolate it does set a lot quicker than the ganache so while you'll want to look for a similar consistency as you were with the chocolate ganache you need to work a bit quicker with it because it does set a lot quicker so pop it straight into your piping bag so it's the same obviously the same technique as what we did earlier with the regular chocolate ganache but because white chocolate is going to be setting all the time and because you're probably going to be working on a cool cake you want to work quickly do a little bit at a time and you might find that you need to squeeze a little bit more out to get the perfect drip length [Music] you might be wondering what there's awesome cake is and I guarantee you it looks awesome now it's gonna look amazing when it's finished this is actually our pick a mix cake that we do here at crumbs and doilies and we've actually done it behind the scenes on this cake so I'll put the link to that in the description box below so you can check that out and also if you're in London and you need a cape we do sell these on our website so please go and check that out as well I think that is pretty much done so as you can see that was super easy this is already setting nicely so it doesn't need to be put in the fridge as I said white chocolate just kind of set and next I'm going to show you how to color your white chocolate so for coloring white chocolate it's really simple but you do have to use the right kind of food coloring gel paste and stuff like that aren't quite right and they tend not to mix very well what I always use is an oil-based color and americolor is a good brand that does a lot of them or you can use powder colors as well but I find the oil-based colors mix in a lot better and another thing to remember with coloring white chocolate is some of the colors will make it stiffen up a bit the pink which I'm about to use is really nice and doesn't have too much of an effect but the red for example makes its puffing up really quickly so you do have to sort of experiment a little bit with the amounts of coloring that you're going to put in and also this stuff is SuperDuper perfectly concentrated so a little goes a long way I've already melted my white chocolate with some cocoa butter and some white super white as well the reason I'm using super white is just to get it back to a paler base color before I add the color so that the yellow doesn't kind of murky it up so it's all lovely and melted it's just the right consistency and I'm gonna start by adding a couple of drops and seeing what my colors light now if you do find that by adding color you've stiffened up your white chocolate a little bit too much then I would recommend having a little bit of melted cocoa butter on hand just to add a couple of drifts to it just to loosen it up again this one's looking fine so I'm going to go ahead and do it my cake if you find that your white chocolate is seizing up a little bit before you've had a chance to spread it out neatly then you can just heat your palate knife up just get it nice and hot but make sure it's dry so I normally have like a cup of boiling water but just make sure you don't use a wet palette knife and that will keep it nice and smooth but this one's turned out pretty well so now that you have mastered the drip cake there's lots of things you could do you could even try doing like a rainbow drink which would look brilliant even do a painted gold drip which I've actually done on my channel so I'll put the link to that in the description box below it is from Christmas but don't let that put you off it's good for all year round guys and if you do take if you do take pictures of your work then please do put them on instagram

whiskey cooking show my name is charlotte i come from a partisary and perfect chef background and i'm here to share with you my knowledge about cooking and baking through step by step videos every week let's admit it this year is we're all doing our best in such difficult situations but please we all deserve the piece of good chocolate chip cookie and indulge ourselves without even an ounce of guilt and today i'm going to help you achieve that with my devil double chocolate chip sea salt [Music] devil double chocolate chip sea salt cookie it's buttery soft and fudgy and is flooded with chocolate goodness that's intensified with the addition of sea salt flakes and coffee to make a good chocolate chip cookie let's have a guess of the most crucial element because a huge proportion of this cookie is literally chocolate so please you have to get the best chocolate bar that you can get for this recipe to give this justice i use my go-to 85 lean chocolate bar because i found its sweet bitter ratio perfect for these cookies but it's purely my personal preference you can use whatever chocolate you want as long as they're real chocolate and taste good i allowed it i'm craving the cookies right now so let's whisk it up let's check out what we need for this recipe [Music] first cream room temperature butter brown sugar and custard sugar and start mixing on medium speed then gradually increase to medium high speed [Music] creaming in the baking world means mixing sugar and softened butter for the sugar to be evenly distributed and dissolved this process also helps incorporate air and volume into the mixture to do this softened butter is what we need and i usually take my butter out the previous night or a few hours before baking but of course it depends on how hot the water is at the time being scrape the sides of the bowls once or twice and continue mixing until light and fluffy then add in one egg and vanilla extract mix on medium high speed and scrape the sides occasionally to make sure that no sugar lumps remain [Music] now it's time for the dry ingredients add in all-purpose flour cocoa powder baking soda instant coffee powder and salt mix on low speed for around 15 seconds until just combined [Music] we all know seasoning is crucial in cooking but don't forget to use salt in baking as well because even little salt can effectively bring out and enhance the flavors of the ingredients how can we not talk about this if we're making sea salt cookies for the sprinkles we're using molden sea salt flakes mold and sea salt has been harvested from the coastal town of melbourne since 1882 this pyramid-shaped sea salt is a goma salt that has a flaky texture and a less bitter and salty taste than regular salt well everything about it sounds really good but molten salt isn't cheap no no we're not going to use it to boil our pasta but it is a really good candidate as the finishing salt to let its flaky texture and beautiful shape shine through on the cookies now chop your chosen chocolate into small pieces try to keep them in small chunks so that you will get molten chocolate pieces in the cookies you've got to have them right [Music] pop the chocolate into the mixing bowl and gently mix with your spatula until all the chocolate pieces are beautifully spread in the batter prepare your baking tray and start rolling the batter into cookie balls as they are going to flatten in the oven try to keep some space between them [Music] bake at 190 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes the cookies will still be soft when taken out just let them sit at room temperature for around half an hour for them to firm up a little and get into that amazing fudgy texture [Music] generously sprinkle some sea salt and well our amazing devil double chocolate sea salt cookies are done enjoy it with a cup of hot coffee and i believe is one of the best ways to start your day thank you so much for watching my video i'll see you next week i come from a pet history and you", "s46XUHwJvdg": "break the chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave-safe container heat at 500 watt power for 20 to 30 seconds remove the container from the microwave and mix the contents well repeat these steps until your chocolate is nice and melted it should be smooth and shiny important to achieve best results you must melt the chocolate at least 3 times you", "rgQMQLPgpJc": "hey what's happening doing some chocolate review right here and saw this on the shelf the other day and it was on sale and there was a bunch of them I can tell you why in a second but 92 percent cacao are basically just 99 percent pure chocolate that's the most I've ever seen so figured what the heck I just did a review on 86 percent which was what I thought already to be a little bit over bitter so mystique anyway today - I'm shooting the Google campsite right back on the lake back in this little Cove it's a great spot to snack and chill their hard day's work why not so oh well I already tried one piece of this the other day it's your standard nice little square I want to tell you what I think about that and I will be donating it the rest of this to the little creatures of the world it is bitter the aftertaste is horrible there's no sweetness whatsoever to it dry and unappealing whatsoever I couldn't even see stacking this with peanut butter or anything else it's just to me unless you really like that super dark I take one more bite just for the hell of it because I'll never buy it again so you do some little creatures out there and overall it off like it it's pretty strong I'd say honestly anything above 70 gets into where it's just not a good flavor yeah that's what it is that's my review it is it is intense there's no doubt about who's an intensely bitter shitty taste in my mouth that's words I personally would not recommend this product it is really more of a curiosity than anything else even if you like dark chocolate I'd stick to the eighty-six percent which was freakin dark enough and honestly I'd stick it to stuff in the 70s maybe 76 or something like that but whatever is worth the try why not although I can not give this product a thumbs up you can still give this video a thumbs up and hit the subscribe button and have a wonderful day", "C_Sq1zSjZYI": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to indulgence cuisine today we're

because cocoa is tends to be more in the world of adulteration the cafe as we know it actually comes from chocolate the most complex food on the planet [Music] and is open it's a process it's not addictive actually impressed with how much chocolate we Venus so much [Music] so in a milk-chocolate bar like what's the percentage of chocolate that you generally see typical milk chocolate bar three or four percent only three or four percent but your chocolate what would you say we have no way it's a hundred so this is no ordinary chocolate this process uses raw cacao just one ingredient it was delicious cacao grows on trees and these are dried pods from the trees the chocolate making process starts with the cacao pods these are what cacao pods look like on the oh they're beautiful they're really red and vibrant and inside are the beans and around each bean is this soft pillowy fruity substance that's extremely flavorful so when all the beans are pulled out of the pod and they're lightly fermented and those are taken and dried those beans the skins are taken off and inside the beam we have these bits and pieces which are called nibs and when you think of raw chocolate you think of that really bitter flavor the nibs are really fruity almost and that's what it is it's a fruit and from that point we take the nibs and grind them once we put this in our grinders and start grinding it then the oils start to warm up and come out okay and it turns it into people call it a liqueur or paste it's just ground nibs and from that you can get cacao butter from that then it can be pressed and you can press the butter out and the fibers are separate once you have the nibs there ground up that liquid basically is ready to go it's chocolate but this is what the nibs will turn into and this is about three days you see the crumbs and the chunks yeah we go for about 10-12 days and then it look at just super super super silky smooth so it's powered from the bottom and the wheels just roll on the base plate stone you're not heating it at all we're not heating it at all so you can feel that it's barely barely really warm just from the friction just from friction just from room temp they grind more than just cacao they also grind all their own nut butters they had pumpkin seed butter and coconut butter and making that kind of nice paste out of each one right now we have over a thousand different recipes a thousand different recipes and we have 50 different flavors at any one time so that's this stage and then we move over to where we store it and turn it into the finished chocolate this machine does a few things it keeps it warm it'll change the temperature to anything we want and it's also a continuous tempering melter is what it's called so gorgeous it's not as bitter as you would think is it it's like butter as fresh as it gets wow that is so smooth oh my good super chocolate wasted here all those good love chemicals flow into your system this chocolate has so many like medicinal properties so many like mood boosting properties to have stuff in there that's similar to cannabinoids yes and some of the other feel-good endorphins all that good stuff there's Piniella mean which is PE a the love drug or the love love love chemical PA Anand amide which is from the Sanskrit word Ananda which means bliss it's the most complex food on the planet or one of the most complex over a thousand different chemical compounds the first time somebody gifted me the three cacao beans like I gave you yeah I set with him and I tasted one and we've got a very definite like euphoric feeling like a love buzz and I said there's something to this that's what started my love for chocolate yeah was that feeling of bliss it's really important for chocolate to go through the right tempering process which just means changing the temperature from hot to cold them back again to kind of realign those fatty structures we are making Michelle for the triple chocolate step ya'll chocolates and I will stop the flow get the tray under [Music] yeah I'll tape it it's all even them I just spend enough Showtime pedal pedal out right upside down and oh the one-handed technique fingers are too fast Oh with the edge I'll collect my paycheck on Friday all right so these need a hard enough right [Music] there was a tempering machine that could temper chocolate and there was also a method that Jeffrey taught us how to temper it by hand we're gonna temper ups with the chocolate on the slab here tempering chocolate on the slab so I was working with nori with the machine so you do this manually yeah so basically I'm doing the same thing that the tempering machine is doing but we're gonna do it with the solid slab of serpentine so we've got our cacao paste and I'm gonna add a little bit of cacao butter to cut it because it's so thick by the time I add the honey if I don't it'll be too so your flavoring this chocolate yeah we're gonna we're gonna make some vanilla rose vanilla it's one of my favorites and it's definitely a favorite around here we use pure food great essential oils so I'm gonna do put one drop of rose essential oil in here and then one drop of co2 extract vanilla which is all you need very strong so we'll do a honey sweet and chocolate and so I keep the honey really warm so it's d crystallized everything that I make here is all done been doing this for over ten years the same way same Bowl same everything small small batch on the slab and what I like to do is take the the temperature of the chocolate and of the slab before I temper it and what that does is that gives me a good idea of how much I'm gonna pour onto the slab getting it to that perfect point where the molecules align so you get that nice snappy chocolate that you're kind of familiar with so that's that is when it's perfectly tempered we're gonna reform the fact this is bring it into some form crystallized structure and that's how it's gonna pop free from the mold I just like to use these little these little temperatures it just takes the surface temperature we're about we're 60 about 69 70 on the slab and we're about a hundred and eight or so with the chocolate right now the temperatures come down with adding those ingredients all right so you just pour chocolate out on the slab like so I'm just going to move it it is gonna yeah chocolate yeah absolutely know that cold stone is taking that out you'll see you'll start to see it thicken up pretty quick that's everything that's that cocoa butter you add a it's the honey solidifying a little bit and the chocolate sauce so that's it you can see how thick that is it's not even running anymore and this is that this is a very small batch an idea how we do it that's that take it back over here mix it all back in okay so I hit my mark so I hit it hit it exactly where I wanted it and I'm just gonna get these into the molds as quick as I can it's already starting to set up yeah that's what uh what a joy and a lot of fun to work with there's a delight you can take and washing someone make something by hand and seeing the handcrafted nature of this chocolate was just mesmerizing you always do it like this small batches by hand every single piece every single piece you lift it then it comes out ain't okay to mess up you can just come back and fix it a little bit so this is basically how it goes it just needs more chocolate on top great running it solidifies okay we have to process I know it is a problem no really more shell on top exactly yeah there we go it comes out quick yeah anything you just oh goody pop this chocolate was a whole new experience it's fun to eat too much of this chocolate because I don't feel like the heaviness of normal chocolate but there's a different experience than like the lethargic can't move the rest of the day beautiful how much chakra we Venus so much bee buzzing I don't feel happier like I don't feel like Oh roll me out of here I feel like I've had my fill over chocolate and I can eat this you know I can eat this right before bed it's not again not like the traditional sense of chocolate where it's loaded with everything but chocolate as stimulants as not feeling good job that's the most magnesium rich food with planet so really easy and you know magnesium is a relaxer it relaxes your whole baby good for the heart eating this chocolate was really satisfying it was really filling even with a small piece just like this and that's kind of the whole point at least for music as chocolate makers - from one little piece to be absolutely rich whose fault I'm extremely grateful for the people that make these kinds of products where they're making something that's as close to raw as possible so it's not extremely processed it's not mass-produced it's something handmade and locally so much it's not just about the process of making chocolate it's really about the love and the passion and the people so now that you know about the cacao plant maybe learn about these other plants in vertical farming the future of gardening with no soil and greatly reduced water I'm just gonna eat this job",

like the Hershey's cookies and cream bars or just like a regular Hershey's milk chocolate bars good mmm but we don't like dark chocolate no not at all and so we thought what better way to make a video then to make a video taste testing a dark chocolate that we hate 95 percent cocoa and chili great so yeah um yeah as Alex said we don't link dark chocolate and we thought you know what this was actually your idea that was do this so we thought we do a little taste test of this Lindt excellence 95 percent cocoa exquisitely intense cocoa flavor and then the other one is Lin excellence chili dark infused with spicy red chili which I'm kind of excited to try looks like your looks like you wanna try that one first we'll do the chili which one do you want to do for now we can do the chili 1 excellence chili has a Retina display stars brown color and subtle spicy aroma um we can do that one first because it's gonna be spicy and then we can wash it down with some 95 percent it's actually kind of funny because I got this idea I was going through the grocery store the other day and I saw that in my personal grocery store we have like how you open all right so when my grocery store we had 92% I think and I was like wow that's a lot and say now basically I don't know if you guys know this but the higher the coco percent the higher like it's basically pure pure no okay less sugar so basically like 99 actually do make a 99% one but we couldn't find that so 95 is good enough yeah and basically 99% is literally like 1% away from baker's chocolate you've never had big idea alright so this is the Tilley Morse it's just the chilly one okay so show them what it looks like I mean looks like chocolate right yep how's its cheers Cheers smells like chocolate hmm interesting it's very subtle mm-hmm really yeah it's very um dark one is fun it's actually not that bad I mean 47 per se is 7% okay okay oh god I'm scared for the home this one's actually not bad they kind of like it I mean the Chili's weird chili is weird it's not that chili that's bothering me it's the dark chocolate slobbering around not bad you can have that one so next we're going to do the 95 percent I'm not looking forward to this one at all actually when we read what it says sure take a journey with excellence chocolate so rich and refined that it leads you to discover new territories of chocolate pleasure oh man it's so brittle he just broke it yeah there's the other rest to your piece I think I'm gonna just eat this part ready how's it smell it smells like that oh god that was horrible it tastes like it's baker's shop that's a bigger shot look days like I feel like this is what like caulk would taste like I don't know like some cement oh my god it's horrible that was not excellent at all it's weird it's like okay so basically it tastes like Baker's the chilly one no so that's a big first one yeah that's literally like I got this much and I'm like oh so I mean if you love dark dark dark dark dark chocolate I mean okay it says the 95% is intense nutty dry and earthy I can definitely see the earthy and the dry the absolute pinnacle of pure dark chocolate which reveals the true flavor and strength of finest cocoa beans you know what would go great with this melt it mix it with some milk some sugar got a corner yeah that that would make it excellent for me so I'm just not like a connoisseur of chocolate like I'm fine with milk chocolate white chocolate like I'm not really even like the biggest like when it comes to cake like I only like a chocolate cakes okay but like if I had a choice I would choose like but no um vanilla you know that's for me okay so I stole that horrible taste in my oh that tastes worse than the chili you want some more chili one no I don't either it's the only one was sweeter and they sit more like chocolate so basically if you guys know what baker's chocolate tastes like it literally tastes like this except it's like maybe well I guess 5% sweeter because you know 95% this is gonna make like regular dark chocolate tastes like milk chocolate so if you have to choose which ones you like better jelly yeah I like the telling one better too I mean this the excellence one I mean like I said if you love dark dark dark dark dark dark dark chocolate um definitely try it um the chilly one today's sweeter with like a hint of like spiciness

chocolate so firstly you're going to add your almonds your walnuts cashew nuts raisins or Sultana dried figs and your cranberries in a bowl and then give it a quick mix now boil some water in a vessel and take your chopped chocolate in another vessel and place it about it make sure that the water is not about its boiling point or it will ruin your chocolate and you have to keep mixing just till the chocolate melts and this is going to take some time but you have to be patient you can see here that the chocolate is slowly melting and I was lifting the bull just to make sure that the water is not too hot [Music] and you can see that the chocolate is melted and it looks so beautiful now I do dry fruits and nuts in there and mix it all up now you have to fill the chocolate mixture in the chocolate molds [Music] and make sure to be patient while doing this it does take quite a while give the mold a tap once in a while just to make sure that the chocolate is uniform at the top [Music] you can use really pretty shapes [Music] once all your moles are filled you can keep them in the freezer for 10 minutes so that they are hard and then take them out and they come out so easily you can see that and you can place the chocolates in the serving tray repeat it with the remaining moles [Music] and here are the chocolates in daylight they look so beautiful and I took a bite here to show you how it looks on the inside and it has so many fruits and nuts in it it's so delicious here I'll show you how I wrap my chocolates so I took a square gift paper and then place my chocolate inside it they're going to collect all the corners of the paper and give it a small twist this is a wire which is wrapped in glitter paper and you can get it in any craft store and then I'm going to lock the paper in place with it and that's it it looks so cute repeat with all of the chocolates and this made 15 chocolates [Music] that was the last of them these chocolates can make a wonderful gift so go ahead and surprise your friends or family or anyone did check out my channel for other recipes of mine and subscribe to stay updated with all many recipes I'll see you soon with another video bye",

delicious oh this one came cracked I wonder if my wife accidentally messed that up though so I'm curious to know if this one is broken up into different squares that's one thing that I don't understand about chocolate whenever they're packaging them I talked about this in the previous video is that it seems like you would want to put the pretty side of it out like you're opening it up and you want to see that side of it not this side I don't know why chocolate people do that you all know down that's below it's kind of like whenever you open up a letter for the first time you open it up

little bit of cane sugar in there the cocoa butter some vanilla ground vanilla bean in there very simple ingredients 11 grams of saturated fat 7 sugars okay but 5 grams of that's fiber a little drier I want to say then this other one here the strong in velvet ones a little bit like a little bit more powdery if you will which I don't mind I actually kind of like that there's a on the back of my tongue I can taste like a little hint of something and I can't quite tell what it is it might be the vanilla that's kind of coming through but all in all decent chocolate right there I kind of wish that the squares were a little bit smaller I like the size of these better if y'all remember from the previous video it's like a little bit thicker but it's like a chunk just like a big chunk right there I'm kind of curious to know these servings here servings - Oh a half the bar is the servings on here okay so it's not I thought it was gonna be each individual square but it's half the bar for

thanks for our sing", "etbDLQo7xKo": "This time of year I really enjoy a spot of\ncookie baking. What I really like to do is make up a batch\nof the dough in advance and then the minute people pop in I just put the cookies in the\noven and there I am with a cup of tea and some warm, gooey cookies. And what I have in mine are not just ordinary\nchocolate chip cookies, but my triple chocolate buckwheat cookies and the buckwheat flour\nbrings such smokiness and intensity of flavour. Got my buckwheat flour here, 125 grams of it. And on top goes half a teaspoon of bicarb. I\u2019m adding half a teaspoon of salt, that\u2019s\nfine sea salt and the first of the three chocolate ingredients; 25 grams of cocoa. Fork these together. Now I just need to cream the butter and sugar;\n60 grams of soft butter there and I want 125 grams of soft dark sugar. I\u2019ll mix them together. So you can see it\u2019s a rather wonderful rich,\ndark caramel colour. Now a teaspoon of vanilla paste. And now I\u2019m ready for the second of my chocolate\ncomponents, some glorious dark chocolate, Look at it, rippling out. I need two eggs, ... and the reason I use fridge cold eggs is that it means I don\u2019t have to put the\nbatter into the fridge before shaping the cookies. I am gonna thicken it up by adding the dry\ningredients. It\u2019s better to fold the dry ingredients\nin a bit first. IRight, chocolate-wise I am achieving the\ntriple with the addition of some chocolate chips. Now I\u2019m ready to mould this mixture haphazardly\ninto cookies. I like to leave them quite heaped, it helps\ngive that wonderful texture that\u2019s a cross between a brownie and a cookie. They need nine to ten minutes in an oven\nThat lot are headed for the oven and this lot are headed for the freezer. I freeze these on the tray as they are and\nthen once they\u2019re set I stash them into sealed freezer bags and then I just add one\nminute onto the baking time.

is lynx excellence 85% coca extra dark chocolate this entire bar is a net weight of three and a half ounces or a hundred grams and it's a full bodied cocoa flavor 85% pretty dark let's go ahead and look at the back I love how they've packaged this with the with the gold embossed lettering it's very very fancy this particularly I think was like two dollars and sixty some cents but you see the chocolatier this is a Swiss chocolate chocolatier smelling it linked excellence gourmet chocolate is prepared especially for you by Lynch master chocolatiers who from selecting the highest quality cocoa beans to creating the finest textures and taste chocolate can offer demand nothing less than perfection experience the ultimate union of force and finesse through lint excellences intense and elegant flavors fine textures and lingering taste discover Lindt excellence with all your senses excellence 85% coca is distinguished by a deep brown color and powerful aroma of cocoa experienced this full-bodied chocolate with just enough bitterness to highlight its strength and distinct personality for true affection Otto's I don't know if I'm quite the true affection Otto but I do like dark chocolate ingredients chocolate cocoa powder cocoa butter Demerara sugar I'm supposed to be some fancy sugar and bourbon vanilla beans so chocolate cocoa powder cocoa butter sugar bourbon vanilla beans may contain traces of peanuts tree nuts milk soy beans dark chocolate contains cocoa solids 85 percent minimum keep it in a cool and dry place this effect came right out of my refrigerator I always keep it in the refrigerator let's move on to the nutrition facts serving size four squares about two and a half servings per container so that's going to be a total ten squares all right I'm assuming there's gonna be one two and then five down I don't know we'll open it and look all right in four squares you get a total of 18 grams of fat 28 percent of your daily value and that's in four squares that's 230 calories so that's gonna be approximately 500 calories in one bar did I do the math right no I did not 500 plus 600 it's gonna be about 600 calories in one bar a little bit short of that and in total calories from fat 170 saturated fat 11 grams 55% of your daily value in one serving okay that's quite a bit so do you have 15 milligrams one percent of your daily value total carbohydrates 15 grams 5% but what you want to notice is there's 6 grams of dietary fiber 24 percent of your daily value but all the 15 grams of carbs 5 of those are coming from sugar even though 5 grams of added sugar seems like it a lot pear chocolate is very bitter and 5 grams is actually not that much compared in relation to other chocolates almost every dark chocolate in the store has 5 grams of sugar per serving and then there's gonna be 5 grams of protein vitamins and minerals not many just 25% of your daily value of iron in one serving so actually this is if you really look at it other than the saturated fat it's not too bad there's not too much added sugar now this has a lot of other nutritional benefits and health claims of as far as antioxidants this has some some the composition of the chopped coca has some relation to caffeine so it keeps you a little alert but it has some other health benefits that it touts that's not necessarily explicitly stated in the nutrition fact all right let's go ahead and bust it open and see what it looks like oh it's very nicely packaged it comes in a nice foil wrapped boil and my suspicion was correct as one two three four five times two so ten ten squares in this I'm gonna actually break up a couple squares before I open this so I can take them up nicely there we go and break it open boom two chocolates two squares of chocolates this is a little bit shy of one serving and there it is very crisp very nice nice textures extremely dark as you can see so having my camera's even having trouble resolving it there there we go you see if I can pick it up and bring it closer to you guys okay there we go nice much better lint dark chocolate 85% see what it smells like I'm gonna smell the other one so I can keep looking this smells very kind of waxy you don't really can you can't really smell much of the sugar and definitely chocolate you see a heavy heavy scent of chocolate smells really good okay I'm gonna go ahead and the texture is that chocolate it's a little bit waxy buttery it's kind of melting in my hand and let's go ahead I'm gonna go ahead and taste it oh wow definitely not sweet mmm bitter very bitter almost of the bitter is black coffee it's actually kinda remind you a black copy of you don't have the acquired taste of dark chocolate you probably are not gonna like this even for me I like dark chocolate this is a little much eighty-five percent is pretty intense very potent I did I don't know if I think I'd probably eat this with something or put it on something alone it's really bitter very bitter very very strong bold taste I'm honestly not a true chocolate shinato as the packaging is stated but I mean really it does taste good if you can get past the bitterness the actual flavor of the pure chocolate is really good it is very very clean it's not waxy it's very smooth when it melts in your mouth and melted very consistently I'm gonna taste pretty good it is very bitter initially when you take a bite you get that kind of hint of thats 5 grams of sugar the sweet taste and then once the chocolate melts and it flows across your tongue and hit your taste buds that bitterness really sets in and depending on who you are you may or may not like it definitely not sweet mmm definitely bitter and it has a strong aftertaste now if you like that sort of thing you're gonna like I think everybody should try it this is without a shadow of a doubt a tertiary food look in the description below for explanation of this no looking at this is going to be an interesting one to plot on our chart of the health continuum is it better off not eating you're better eating I would say this is a 4 out of 10 I'm not super certain about the I wouldn't put it as far down as candy because it doesn't have all that sugar but it does have a lot of saturated fat so but it has another a lot of other anti-depressive antioxidant properties some people would even call this a health food if I were eating it at a health food I would suggest eating it in the morning because if you eat this dark of chocolate at night unless you are like if you're like me and I'm really sensitive is a caffeine it might keep you up because of the stimulant complement component of the cocoa um the cocoa beans and so I would give it a 4 or 3 or 4 out of 10 I'm gonna entirely sure on all the health benefit properties but it's definitely better than a candy because there's not that much sugar in it so let's go ahead look at it on a glycemic index go believe it or not it's actually gonna score pretty well it's actually lower on the glycemic index scale could at 40 out of 100 you look in the description below will look at more information on this and that's because it's a pure chocolate there's not much sugar to it so take it for what it's worth anyway I hope you liked the review please give it a thumbs up if you liked it hit the subscribe button so you can see my other reviews that are similar to this I mean while I review other foods but definitely if you like dark chocolate this is for you if you haven't tried it or you don't know this is where this is where you should start if you don't like dark chocolate and it's too bitter for you this is not for you so anyways thanks for watching alright and if you ever wanting a dark chocolate but you want it a little sweeter just when you're in the store look at the back of the package and see what kind of sugar content it has this is real low at five the other ones will be like 7 or 17 maybe a little bit higher you may like those better if you like sweeter chocolates alright thanks for watching take care bye", "occ5_fVXRj0": "i broken backs go go dance today I'm going to show you how to make a really simple

pieces 60 ml of water 120 ml of milk 60 mil cream and a couple of teaspoons of brown sugar it's this simple what you do tok tok that drops into your path right side and then just cover it with the boiling water and then with a spatula I'm just going to mix this around and incorporate the dark chocolate into the boiling water so will the dark chocolates melted into the boiling water next thing I'm going to do is plump the pan on some heat bring it to the boil and add some milk some cream and the sugar I'm pulling the milk in like side and the cream stubble cream with this well and then the sugar so as you can see it's come to the boil now obviously the longer you leave it on the heat the thicker the hot chocolate will be so I'm just going to pour it into a couple of cups obviously could squirt some cream on the top of this or you could even leave it to go cold and pour it in a glass obviously if you want to change the recipe you can add different spices you could add run to it you could add an expresso to it or even some chili it's completely up to you Cheers", "Ivoi1NSxd1Q": "nope this one has nuts this one's not gluten-free may contain dairy why is finding a snack for kids

welcome back to my channel today I am back again with another keto review and today I'm going to be reviewing Lily's dark chocolate chips you guys have no idea how happy I am I found these at my local supermarket and my local winn-dixie actually I love shopping at winn-dixie they have great quality food but they never used to have like a lot of healthier options except like the organic section where they had like organic veggies or fruits and stuff like that but they have like completely changed they're bringing more healthy stuff and I found a section where they had these and these I would only be able to oh I've never tried these I've tried the bars the chocolate bars these I used to buy the chocolate bars I used to buy them at Whole Foods that's the only place where I would be able to find them but I was so happy to see that oh my god when Dixie had them so I already I bought two of these packs to have them in stock because like I said eggs they are hard to find for me or they were and I hate one of Whole Foods because Whole Foods is so expensive but anyway um so this is OK premium baking chips Lily's dark chocolate stevia-sweetened these are a hundred percent keto friendly 55 percent cocoa ahh vegan non-gmo no sugar act okay now the total carbohydrates is nine grams but the dietary fiber is four grams which you always deduct from the total carbs and it has a richer tone which is a really good a sweetener to have on keto and the erythritol is three grams so the dietary plus the erythritol would be seven total so seven you gotta deduct that from the 9 grams of carb soda ducting something from 9 that would be only 2 net cards for the serving size is 60 chocolate chips so you could have quite a generous amount like a generous handful and it'll only be 2 net cards that's amazing look at this so these are for baking like I said I already opened them up and I have tried them but I'm gonna get a little handful to show you guys look at that Oh yummy they're super small so these are like for baking hmm I know what it is dark chocolate but since it's sweetened with stevia right you guys they taste just like regular chocolate chips oh my god mmm so I'm here like already brainstorming thinking what can I do with these but you know like I said a yummy little snack for when you're craving something sweet or you need that chocolate fix or that sugar fix these are awesome but you could also get creative with them because like I said they're for baking so if you have some keto friendly recipes that you could incorporate these chocolate chips I already thought of what I'm gonna do with these keto pancake chocolate chips chocolate chip keto pancake oh my god I always make my keto pancake with 2 eggs 2 ounces of cream cheese and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon imagine putting some of these in there oh my god you guys and my son Samuel loves chocolate chip pancakes every time we go to either Denny's or our ha he gets the chocolate chip pancakes so I could even make these for him and it's a much healthier much much healthier choice than regular chocolate earlier regular chocolate chips like I said all the Lilly's products are made with stevia stevia is the only 100% feet'll friendly sweetener sold you guys cannot go wrong with any product this says stevia know when you guys buy products with stevia on it or even like the little packets of stevia please make sure that it's a hundred percent only stevia extract a recently bought a box of of stevia but this one was different it didn't say stevia alone it said organic stevia in the raw when I looked at the ingredients in the back not only did it have stevia from the extract leaf but it had dextrose dextrose is not keto friendly dextrose is as bad as Mount maltodextrin which is another word for sugar soles like what the heck I used to like once in my bulletproof coffee and when I saw the ingredients when I saw that I had dextrose I stopped taking it so always make sure the best stevia that you could always buy is the liquid one that comes you just use the drops that is zero everything in its pure stevia extract there is nothing else added to it and it's zero calories zero carbs zero everything zero sugars so please make sure that when you buy stuff that that says stevia you check really good the the ingredients make sure there's nothing along the lines of dextran or dextrose or maltodextrin because that is absolutely not keto friendly it will kick you off ketosis so with that said with Lilly's brand you do not have to worry because all the Lilly's brands are a hundred percent keto friendly it's all made with stevia and erythritol okay I always have a hard time saying that word but you guys will see in the back the package alright so a writ that all is very keto friendly so anytime that you are trying to have like a ketose sweet or something if you see it has a Reuters haul it's okay anything with stevia like I said it's okay and this one like I said it says no sugar added so oh my god you know so anyway I got a small little handful and that's it I don't know if it did do it because I already I just recorded a mukbang in a horror movie from you guys and I wanted something a little sweet at the end so huh I wanted to this review they're so good you know what they remind me up oh my god back in the days when Blockbuster Video was still open we will go as a family to rent movies I miss those days and every Friday night we will go we eat that was before my two babies were born before Jacob and Caleb so we only had Sam our first son and it was me David and Sam and we will go to Blockbuster Video Friday night we would each pick a movie that we liked we each picked a bag of popcorn and our favorite candy and I've always loved chocolate-covered almonds Raisinets or snow caps you guys remember the snow caps I was like little chocolate tips no little bigger than this and they were covered with like white little dots of candy or something oh my god well this reminds me of that this reminds me of snow caps that's what it tastes like and like I said it's dark chocolate oh my god okay I need to stop but they totally remind me of smoke anyway you guys that's it for this review I hope you guys enjoyed it like I said if you are doing keto and you are the type of person that need to have something sweet from time to time lilies chocolates are 100% eco-friendly you know as women during that time of the month sometimes we just need chocolate or we're gonna kill someone well when you're feeling like that go for the healthier kind which is ladies brand' no you guys I'm not sponsored by them but I really really love the ladies products and like I said if you go to the only place I found them is in Whole Foods like I said but if you go to like a place where they saw these products and stuff like that you're gonna find the bars they have like they have dark chocolate they have assaulted with salted almonds inside they have one I think with a caramel flavor they even have milk chocolate flavored they have tons of keto friendly chocolate bars like I said they are all made with stevia all the Lily's chocolates are made with stevia that's why like I said you'll find these products mostly in places like Whole Foods or maybe in the healthy section of your local supermarket or whatever so I'm super glad than my winn-dixie carries it because my Whole Foods is a little farther from my house I'm like I said it's extremely expensive I never go there to do groceries I only go there when I'm going to find something specifically that I cannot find anywhere else then I'll go there but you know what's to drive all the way to Whole Foods just to buy like freakin keto friendly chocolate you know it sucks so I'm so glad that my winn-dixie started bringing out healthier choices because this this was awesome anyway don't meet it every day though you guys that's why these are called tweets if you're still now if you're maintenance mode that's different inmates in this mode you a little more you could get away with eating these often but if you're still trying to lose weight please only have these once in a while treat when Orban went like I said when you feel that you really need something sweet that's what I do I try to resist the temptation as much as I can to try to stay away from sleeps and all kinds of fake sugars because even though a lot of these things that keto friendly a lot of people's bodies are different sometimes your body might react differently and even though it does say keto friendly it might either kick you off or and maybe not kick you out but it might stall you you know and right now at this stage in my weight loss I cannot afford to be stalled anymore because like I said my body is very comfortable with the weight I'm in now I've been weighing the same thing for like the past two months and my body is just comfortable at 146 that was the last way and I did for you guys and I've pretty much been maintaining the same weight so I'm starting to do things differently now I'm trying to work out more so every day I walk for like a whole hour and I'm trying to cut out fake sugars now I haven't been successfully been able to do it a hundred percent I have cut down on it immensely but there are still days and I'm like oh screw it I can't I need something sweet either in my coffee like you know my sugar free hazelnut creamer or a little treat like this or maybe a little cup of sugar-free jell-o with a little bit of whipped cream and stuff like that you know so and I'm trying not to have it at all well like I said there are days that it's hard there are days that are gonna be difficult and you know what guys it's okay it's okay sometimes you have to listen to your body give it what it needs okay unless your body's asking you for bad carbs and bad sugars then there is definitely a red flag there to look at because you might not be in ketosis but as long as you're in ketosis then there are days where you just you know your hormone or whatever the case may be and you're just craving something sweet either your body's asking for either more food more calories or something sweet that's why these are for keto friendly treats for once and why not give yourself the treat life is short tomorrow is promised to no one so enjoy life while you can while staying healthy that's why I love these because they are healthier choices and I still don't have to feel like I'm deprived of anything because I do have keto friendly choices I don't have to go for the bad sugary carbee stuff when I know that I could have an alternative on keto so these definitely help anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this review as always stay tuned for more and I will see you all in my next video bye guys", "ETt2VGk4JGs": "hey this is kya for the sound box we're here at rhythm and roots 2010 and I'm standing here with the carolina chocolate drops here in the paramount center of backstage we just experienced a mind-blowing I can't even put it into words it was just amazing I wanted to cry I laughed thank you thank you so much tom it was amazing Oh I know out there you spoke of the title track of your new album which is doin a jig and I have the album I did it's wonderful to listening to it for days but it was so great because my listen to it it's like a tango so this is kind of the sound of feel of it for me was it was like a tango and I know you really kind of explained that out there to everybody about wondering if you explain it kind of again the the background of joy negro J charas as a tune those written down in the mid to late eighteen hundreds by man named Dan Emmett and through scholarship that we have found out lots of different people we think there's a there's a good chance that he actually either got the tune or somehow there was an interaction between him and a black string band family from the same part of ohio lived right down the street from him called the snowden family and so he wrote the tune down is Ginuwine negro jig which kind of his way of saying is from an actual black source but he didn't actually put snowden so you know this is kind of supposition but there's a really good chance because they were very well known in the area for tunes and so it was just kind of a really neat way to name our album because it's it's the history of American music it's you know there's interactions between blacks and whites and it's really hard sometimes to pinpoint those down but we we can kind of guess at it sometimes and we know that the tune at least is there you know and it means different things to different people so it's great that's awesome um another thing else you did cover a few songs my favorite was actually why don't you do right I was kind of was actually in the shower and I was like this I love this song I was a lot here but when inspired you as far as you know grabbing at it you know these different artists and just kind of put him on the track there's a I mean it's there's a infinite myriad of different stuff that we grab them for why don't you do right the fellow has been placed percussion on that album sulay Greg Wilson was the first one that really got that into our group and then we've been doing it for years and then we decided to try it when we were in the studio I'll set some of the other covers is basically just like if it's a good song we'll do it and it doesn't really matter where it's coming from you know just we just if it's good tune you know and it works with what we do then we'll do it I cornbread of motor veins okay because i was actually yeah absolutely and it's it's deafening one of you were like was alive like you know was really under albums but everybody anticipated was you know it's one of the favorites so what made you guys want to put this one on the album this time we had recorded it once before for an album i only got released in france but because it hadn't been available in the states yet we figured that you know and it is one of our more requested songs that we needed to go on this album so yeah it was that one was sort of a no-brainer we had to put that on there one thing I do love about your shows is that you bring so much historical content and you know give props where props is to do as far as you know where the songs originated who wrote them you know and that that's really great because not too many artists do that now as far as you know this is a historical so I want to say that that's amazing and I think that's a great thing right when you can bring that to the table and everything so the way we feel is that you know we put those names out there and then if it inspires anybody to go back and check out so you at a baker Joe Thompson a pop of Charlie Jackson you know check out some of the originals then maybe they'll kind of go oh actually this is pretty cool and then maybe they'll go into more stuff of people who do put their stamp on a tune that and while they do don't wholesale write the tune that's something that's been lacking a lot I mean especially in the the folk community and also the black folk singing community since we've just recently lost Odetta and we've recently lost you know some of the older generation you know it's great that we can get in there and we can bring some of that stuff out there just like they did way back last time I saw you what you were not with child and now you have a child just say yes how's being a mall it's great it's great I mean she's 16 months old now and she's been on the road since she was four months old so all right well once again we're here with the carolina chocolate drops 2010 rhythm and roots reunion hopefully we'll see them again next year and this is the sound box of scaia thank you so much don't you know you like it", "9Z8w498YmkE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you", "hNLUkARVHZ0": "we always up guys now today got a pretty random video I'm gonna be trying this 99% cocoa dark chocolates from lived I've always been a fan of dark chocolates and 99% season strong have a very very strong and I can't wait to try out before you start to love to say the package is very nice it's very nicely designed it's got very big 99% of the friends and some very very dark color and so in this case very black just to indicate that it's very dark chocolate so I have got glass of water you can see very nicely it's got some very nice putts inside the back I know this is boring stuff this is what it looks like on the inside and yeah so I'm about peace here it's like a little free peace I'm gonna break point and I'm gonna try it it looks very nice breaking off in just two just to make sure I not kill myself skating guys right it was at this moment Jackson knew talking I was an over-exaggeration but yes you can taste the bits and us it just kind of explodes and then it sticks to like every aspect of your mouth and you can feel like the bitterness just growing inside your mouth it's interesting it's very interesting I just noticed that was a tasting advice and it says excellence 99% is a unique chocolate that reviews all the strengths and richness of cocoa beans the fully appreciate orders we recommend that you progressively developed your palate for a range of high cocoa contents also you have to try out their different dark chocolates first before before going to this one this is like the eternal one but I just bought this one and yeah sorry and then it says the best way to experience this chocolate is to break off a very small piece which I've done but then it says allow it to melt slowly in your mouth that's something I happened that I just bit straight into it yeah and it says it goes well with some coffee which I don't have because I've got water we're gonna try it melting it slowly in our mouth and see what happens this time I've got the second half of the little piece and this time we're just gonna melt it 2,000 years late mugging turn away is still melting and mourning the following scene contains graphic of a very nervous for the poker but it is all right so it's been in my mouth for about two minutes it's a different approach to just eating it because when it's slowly melting freaking sticks to the top of your mouth you can really enjoy the flavor as it enhances in your mouth and it reaches all aspects of your tongue it's quite different to just eating it and it's melting in your mouth you can really taste the cocoa and I can see why this goes well with coffee flavor is very similar you should be able to enjoy it on a Sunday afternoon it's a very nice experience I recommend you guys going out and buying one I bought this in the original shop at two pounds fifty I mean a lot of chocolate but is extremely strong gonna eat another piece of these the feel so sacred anyways guys thank you so much for watching this random video see you next time",

i'm going to keep it in this actual chocolate in it it's nice because this it has enough sugar and sweet but it doesn't have enough so we try on its own it's a bit plain but with the chocolate is perfect you should definitely try it and if you like it let's make a deal if you like it you have to like and share and subscribe bye [Music]", "SC4YOV8o-_Q": "today kevinator and i are to be trying 3 different chocolates from silk a in germany i have the Tober alone this is a swiss milk chocolate with honey and almond nougat and coconut it's crispy Cabernet can I have the trouble on October like Toblerone dark chocolate with honey and almonds I mean a new recipe please I have a Giotto and when on the cheat sheet she said it is a build ball shaped thin wafer with hazelnut semi-sweet creme and covered with dark chocolate and chopped hazelnuts six you get nine balls nine of these so you get 9 bytes yes and I bet it's too dark preview it no it's not too bad you can definitely tell it's dark oh yeah I started getting that hazelnut in the dark chocolate killed it mm-hmm no see I still taste the Heysel that I don't taste it I barely taste the cream the dark chocolate kind of it's pretty strong way he's out everything else now see I'm leaving I'm leaving with the hazelnut I would really like that I think that is well you've got like 5 morning yeah oh I'm relaxing and I will have a picture of you know of all these close up because you can't show you right now now this is among learner if this is the new version Justine you there oh I don't know that I'm gonna be able to there we go and this is coconut [Music] that's gonna get them that honey all this is nothing your feet no yeah we do get the texture of the honey on them but you get the flavor the strong flavor of the cup it up let's go anybody do that not give anything else good you're not getting anything you're not getting the coconut I'm getting the coconut oh okay I'm not getting any of the honey almond I don't taste it I don't taste it but it's the texture the crunchy is the is the Covenant ones that stick in your teeth or that you're like oh honey no but I want security I think the honey is the what sticking in your cheeks because it's candy it's like candy let me see what about it I'm sorry but I think it's the coconut the sticky candy eye pieces are should be honey yeah no I don't taste them no but but you do taste that coconut what do you think about the playful no I love it it's gonna texture I like it I think it is fantastic very good okay and then this is the dark chocolate so we'll see so there's already not a fan so our target on mom now this I probably won't be able to yeah accidentally pulled out okay you're such a good doctor mm-hmm you get the whole crispy and those little cootie things are doing here so you were right I love that drama though and they don't say that a lot about dark drama but it's a really nice quality it's a standard inner what do you think of it cuz you love dark drama no I think that's very good quality I mean would you get that again like if you had that with like a Hershey's special dark which ones you choose that that's better yeah yeah her shoes are kind of big burn operator that is really good with what's on the table here out of the three I don't like this one this big one right here yeah I know you like them I like the Giotto yeah I think the Giotto is really good cuz I can taste that hangs on that no I like coconutty coconut say so thank you very much so guy like I said I'll have a picture for you all at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "Lk61hYkYxRs": "hey y'all it's rebecca turner here and i got my little chef emily james or ej and so many of you reached out to me after the wlbt segment wanting to know about those delicious chocolate strawberry parfaits so i thought that i would show you how easy they are to assemble at home and um yeah and how easy they are and how to do it so i do recommend actually doing several at one time because as you can see it does take kind of a lot of stuff to put them together and i made those the night before the wlbt segment and they lasted two to three days after so you could definitely make yourself three to four of them and it would be it would be perfect so you're just going to start with a container i've got a pretty clear one here so you can see what what's all going into it as you can see ej absolutely loves the chocolate chips so i start with a chocolate granola or you could do your favorite granola whatever whichever you choose you can also do like a cereal a crunchy cereal if you wanted to do that instead i'm going to start with a fourth of a cup of granola on the bottom then i'm going to add in just a few of the chocolate chips i have dark chocolate they're the 70 percent of the hershey's dark chocolate i think you can find them in your grocery dessert aisle so the whole point of me making this for womt for national nutrition month was the fact that you can still have the foods that you enjoy and eat them in a more helpful manner so here taking chocolate and putting it into your breakfast and making it into kind of like a cheesecake parfait or strawberry pie parfait really gives you the best of both worlds okay so you have a layer of granola with a few chocolate chips then you're gonna take some fresh strawberries and you're just gonna slice one or two right over to kind of give you a layer of fresh berries you can do as many as you want there's no exact measurement or perfect way to do it yeah you can just do it and eyeball it you won't if you like a lot of berries you could also do blueberries you could also do you don't want strawberries or you can also do cantaloupe really you could get creative but the strawberries do hold up to the pie puree so this is the secret ingredient so this is found in your dessert and it is where is the power filling right and so what we're not going to do is make a pie what we are going to do is add just enough of this sort of gelatin goodness into our parfait that gives us that kind of taste that we're looking for okay so and don't worry the fact that it's not sugar-free or whatever it may be we're only putting in one or two spoonfuls in a layer and that is going to be a whole lot less than you would have gotten in a cheesecake or you a regular sort of pie i don't recommend making these with a tornado in the kitchen but she's doing good she's with me this morning so here we go all right so now i just have the healthy part it's a really healthy part which is your plain low-fat greek yogurt and it has no added sugar but it's got plenty of protein you're looking at about eight grams of protein per layer you can't get on the thing baby hold on you got to stand up here for mama okay yep and so you're just going to make a nice layer and if you see it's pink that's because i've used this so much for these parfaits that now it's got a little bit of the spoonful of the pie puree on there that it's kind of made it pink but it was white it was clear you can add as much or as little as you would like here i really like a lot of greek yogurt so i'm going to go extra heavy and then you just build another layer from there and really you just go up until you have reached the consistency that you want so granola chocolate chips and if you don't want chocolate chips here you could easily we'll mix it if you wanted to but then also you could add um almonds fresh almonds walnuts any kind of peanut or nut that you would like um slivered almonds is what i was looking for if you wanted to do that there and then maybe one or two more strawberries because this is going to be my breakfast this morning again as you can see it is kind of labor intensive so i would kind of recommend making a few of them at a time that way you know you save time of making pulling all this out to make it but i'd eaten them all that i really enjoyed them i wasn't kidding when i watched when i said i wanted to eat them as soon as the segment was over with symphony you can go back and watch the full wlvt um clip if you would like it is on my facebook as well so one more thing just a little bit of goodness on top and then top it off with one more scoop of good yogurt let's see if ej will top it with some with some chocolate chips you wanna put some chocolate chips on here what you think can you put me a few right there mom's big helper all right i get one thank you all right so you see how easy this was and how absolutely beautiful it is so and it's delicious too and nutritious so i encourage you to give it a try make it your own and then let me know if you do i'd love to know how it turns out for you but maybe until next time ej you wanna tell them bye say bye bye bye", "--3t0-oT8Y0": "hey everybody welcome back to my bake like a pro YouTube channel let's have a little bit of fun with some dark tempered chocolate I've got a chocolate tempering machine right here this here is made by choco vision it is the revelation to be right here I have an unboxing of that and a very detailed review in another video if you want to see that I'll put it a link to it down in the description box below this video so I have tempered the the dark chocolate and I just want to grab some here with a spoon I'm gonna get it right here I'm gonna get it right onto a stainless steel table that I'm working with I'm gonna get quite a bit on here I'll just spread it around that's good you can make this really really large if you want to make a lot of these little chocolates curl type things that you can use with chocolate cakes and any type of cakes really fun and they give a nice finishing texture to the outside of the cake so that's good just like that perfect so you can see here with my hand the size of this that I'm going to be working with today so that's perfect now what I want to do is I just want to let this completely set and that's going to take a number of minutes dark chocolate for me we'll start firming up around four to five minutes this is a little bit thicker so it's probably gonna take about ten minutes before I actually start seeing its setting halfway through the chocolate around five minutes I will start seeing it you can actually see that it starts getting a little bit dry or set on the top but it'll probably take a good half an hour before it's completely firmed so what I'm gonna do now I'll just let this completely firm up and then it'll come back and I'll show you the technique so this is about one hour later I wasn't in a rush so I just let this completely set up I probably could have done this at the 40 minute mark but it's an hour later and here we go so I'm using a little bench scraper and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take it like this and I'm just gonna start pushing so I get it right up against the table and then I just kind of push it and just just kind of eat away at that chocolate and you can see what's happening here we're getting some really nice bits of chocolate that what you can do is frost your cake and then you take these and just stick them to that frosting and it makes a really nice design very visually pleasing just like that you'll see some people they'll come in on the opposite side here and they'll go like this whatever way works for you so you can go like this and you can actually shave the chocolate just like that with different techniques you can do a little bit like this thin it out and then you can come back like this you can see these ones here while you're pushing from the back towards the front you're getting more of a like a longer little ribbon of chocolate like this and if you come in from the back it tends to break it up into smaller pieces but you can see how nice this is don't worry I will zoom in on this once I have finished so just like that you can see how nice this is okay you just push push push just slowly eat away at that massive chocolate so I'm gonna continue doing this and I'll come back right at the end so there we have it look how much we have created from that little puddle of dark chocolate pretty amazing so I do want to keep this video really short so I'm gonna end it here but I just wanted to put my knife through here and just show you how much of these chocolate shavings that we were able to create with that little bit of chocolate nice and airy you want to keep these in a cool dry place and then you can use them as chocolate decorations for anything you can sprinkle them on little chocolate tarts a little bit maybe on a lemon tart you know to give them a little bit of contrast you can use these on the sides of your cake so you'll frost your cake and then you just take these and just pack it around I would suggest that you use some kind of glove either rubber gloves or if you don't want to use little rubber gloves make sure you pick up the chocolate put it on there very very quickly and then remove your hand because you don't want to melt the chocolate but there we have it so a really simple video a really fun one I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs

today I'm gonna do something a little bit different I'm gonna do a taste test so today I'm gonna do a dark chocolate bar taste test there's some variations on the percentage of dark chocolate but all of these on the outside say dark chocolate these are you know this listen you can get from Kroger this I think is a national brand and dangerous species and then a lint is it licit lint Linda excellence dark chocolate and a touch of caramel or caramel and yeah so these are popular brands out there and this may be a future staple of my videos doing some taste test you know like fast food alright so here we go I'm gonna test one of the most interesting bars it sounds like anyway they'll int excellence caramel with touch of sea salt so here we go test this one out and each one I'm just gonna kind of get a square of chocolate here alright so here we go taste test yeah it's a little bit crunchy do the sea salt we could taste the sweetness of the caramel you know the dark chocolate taste isn't that bitter melts in your mouth that was really good very tasty all right there's some water here all right next the endangered-species bar and yeah like any Kroger store you'll probably get these bars all the other stores too all right so I'm gonna need a square of this chocolate and this is see here it says strong velvety dark chocolate 88% with hints of fruit and spice the ultimate and strong smooth dark chocolate so here we go each one I'm serving if this is 180 calories and the other one let's say it's not one ounce but each serving is 150 calories so I've tasted some really bad dark chocolate or dark chocolate this is on the smoother side that's pretty good it's getting up there you know let's say I'm going to compare the sugar okay and once serving this has 16 grams of sugar in one serving this only has three grams of sugar and that's a 1/3 of the bar so very low in sugar not too bad but you know it's definitely on the stronger side of chocolate so as far as ratings go I'd say this one tastes delicious this one is more like I need dark chocolate and I mean this is the way to go but it's not exactly a pleasant experience it's kind of on the borderline of just being a little too maybe not bitter but not you know this is a strong strong chocolate dark chocolate taste all right finally the Private Selection 72% dark chocolate Swiss bar written bell the chocolate crafted from the finest ingredients alright so this is gonna probably be the best one in my opinion at high hopes for this one this one and three squares has 170 calories 8 grams of sugar alright let's try this one nice oil package in here all right nice big square reminds me a lot of the how do you pronounce a lint linden runs a lot it's almost exactly identical packaging to this one alright so here we go Private Selection and it's not nearly as bitter as this one melts in your mouth a lot more more like milk chocolate once dark time goes it's really good so this would be my rating alright so number one smart taste goes I would say this one caramel dark chocolate with a touch of sea salt this one is delicious then we'll go for in the Private Selection setting for two percent dark chocolate and then finally the endangered species right species right here chocolate be last this one probably being the most healthy thanks for watching my videos that one if you like

showing you guys something that's pretty basic but that everyone who bakes should know it is all about how to temper chocolate and in my previous making videos I have mentioned how to temper chocolate but recently I found a way to temper chocolate off the internet that um does not require a thermometer so for those of you who don't have a thermometer at home you can uh temper chocolate and make things that require tempered chocolate without a thermometer so yeah let's just get straight into it so the first things you are going to need is a knife and this is a serrated knife and you need to use a serrated knife so that it cuts the chocolate more easily and here I have some good-quality dark chocolate but if you want you can also use this method with milk or white chocolate I have tried it and it does work and here on my cutting board as you can see I'm just starting at a corner and I'm going to chop my chocolate and as you can see it kind of shaves it off like this into pretty similar sized pieces and this is what we want and we temper chocolate in case you were wondering the tempered chocolate because if you just melt chocolate and then you um dip something in it or you use it in a mold it um it might have white streaks on it or it might look very dull and it might look very matte instead of like really shiny and glossy and professional or it might just not set hard enough at all and it might just melt in your fingers and um and it won't feel very nice rather than a hard shiny smooth shell of chocolate which is what you usually get when you get nice good quality chocolates from stores and so that's why we temper chocolate and there are a lot of ways to temper chocolate but the method we're using today is called seeding and you'll see what that means in a minute so you just want to chop all of the chocolate you have and by the way I did not measure out the amount of chocolate that you can use um any amount of chocolate a lot of people recommend that you use elite at least a pound of chocolate but I find that's not really necessary I'd say just use like at least like three ounces because a pound is a lot if especially if you're buying very good quality chocolate a pound is a lot to buy and it's very expensive so so just use like maybe um at the least three ounces um what I have here probably is about three or four ounces of chocolate here and this works really just fine a lot of people say you have to use a pound at least but you don't have to and as you can see I'm just picking out the bigger chunks of chocolate and chopping them a little finer so that um they can um melt down a little easier and as you can see I'm almost done and then we'll move on to the next step so now that we're all done chopping or chocolate what I'm going to do is just separate it and separate a third about a third of the chocolate you don't have to weigh it out or anything just about a third of the chocolate and place the other two-thirds of your chocolate into a bowl or whatever this is just a measuring cup it's what I had on hand and the third of the chocolate that you separated is going to be your seed chocolate we'll just call it our seed chocolate and you'll understand why why this is called seed chocolate in a minute and we're just going to take the rest of our chocolate over to the stove so I'm just transferring the 2/3 of my chocolate into a bowl and then I'm going to pour a couple inches of water into my pot bring this to a boil and then reduce this down to a simmer and place over my bowl of chocolate and just let that sit there and melt until it is about two-thirds of the way melted and then stir that until it becomes fully melted with no chunks of unmelted chocolate in it and then you just want to take that over the heat off the heat and this might sound a little bit weird but when you put a little bit Cho chocolate below your lip it should feel like a slight sting then here's where the seeding chocolate comes in once you take your other chocolate off the heat you want to add in your seed chocolate that we saved earlier and stir that in until it is melted and the reason you do this is because this is kind of like this science of tempering chocolate when you melt the chocolate the chocolate goes out of temper but then when you add in your seed chocolate the seed chocolate is still in temper so then the melted chocolate sort of follows the leader and it be it becomes temporary tempered chocolate because it takes after the model of the seen chocolate so that's why we save that chocolate and so and that is the method of seeding your chocolate to temper it and then once your seed chocolate is all melted you want to keep stirring this until um it gets thicker and it might get a little more matte but that is perfectly fine that's actually what you want and then you just want to keep stirring this keep stirring this until it becomes um more cooled down and then once again we're gonna do the little weird little lip thing where you if you place a little bit of chocolate below your bottom lip you should be able to feel it and it should feel um sort of cool to the touch that is all there is to it you guys can do whatever you want with this chocolate but I am dipping some pretzel these little mini pretzel nuggets in to my chocolate and as you can see you just want to stir these around pick them up until they're all coated and then tap out the excess with a fork and then transfer them onto a some parchment paper choose set and that's it thanks you guys so much for watching the video

cooking at hilarious kitchen for today's recipe we are going to prepare homemade sweetened chocolate chips or you can call them chocolate chunks please stay tuned if you have not subscribed to my channel please do and do not forget to click on the notification bell for this i need to make a double boiler and i need a bowl of very hot water then i'm going to pick my chocolate this is my dark chocolate chunks i'm going to put them in a bowl then that small bowl i'm just going to put it also inside the hot water to allow the chocolate to melt because if you melt the chocolate direct on the stove it's going to get burnt so please take note of that yeah so the chocolate you just put it into a smaller bowl then inside a bigger bowl with hot boiling water to make it melt so i'm going to keep this for some time until the whole bar is melted this chocolate of mine is dark chocolate that chocolate compound it's not sweetened and if you have the milk compound that's fine but mine was very dark and that means it's not that sweet so i'm just going to add a little bit around two tablespoons of icing sugar you'll be boxing you do that but please i added that to fit in it and i'm going to put it in a wrapping paper allow it to cool for some time and shape over a bar just like that if you would like you can just make it into the shape you want and put it into the fridge if you have to cool down so my bar has stayed for around 30 minutes then i'm just going to cut it or shape it into small cubes and this will allow me to get some chocolate chunks which probably i'm going to use it in my next video to make chocolate cookies so please don't forget to watch my next upcoming video to see how i use this chocolate sweet and chocolations to make some chocolate cookies so please
